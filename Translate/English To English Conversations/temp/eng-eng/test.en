act surprised. walk slowly to the podium.  be modest.  thank them for this incredible honor.
lost something?
maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
whoa, look out there. you really need the whole fist?
isn't that illegal?
i'll give you a couple. see what you think.
fuck is up?!
what was that?
no one ever thought so. you must bring it out.
sit tight.  i'm on my way.
now listen, this is the plan. as soon as school is finished we go to utah and...
m'hm.
pretty slick, eh?
i'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
yeah, uh, listen. why don't you go upstairs and keep your mom and brady company for a bit? i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment.
no. i can help you.
my pleasure .. who's popeye?
singer!
did you hear something?
you just said
hmmmm . . .
cool!
that's why it was four years between you and thomas.  it took me that long to regain her respect.
oh yeah. much better.
haven't you ever heard of smack! horse!  junk!  heroin!
i might be making a mistake.
a girl has to have a bit of glamour.
small potatoes.
first time for everything.
i wasn't --
airport.
i dunno, boy.
one moment.
that thunder's sure somethin'.
these are all valid comments, but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
basic.  hmmm.
why not?
well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
and then keep on driving?
has that girl -- has thea ever told you where she comes from?
well, yeah, kind of.
can you pay some attention to me?
leave me now. you can go to bed.
...excuse me?!
debo!  debo!
fine with me.
ray!  where are you?  are you all right?
i could be, too.
yeah, although i'm not going to turn him in. i like hearing the dirt.
yes, i wanted to get here before the others.... i want to talk to you alone.
hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. it's one of the perks of the job. if you're interested, tomorrow i could show you some of my favorite spots.
i knew this would happen! those bastard canadians have now killed a child! can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
all settled?  grand!  why did your mother ever divorce him?  he's swell.
it wouldn't hurt. you can't go on living in fantasies. did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? and drop it?  why, our strategic defense boys would have  --
and believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
i look pretty.
ever talk to him?
you don't like brussel sprouts?
no--i'm furious!--nobody seems to do anything about it--
i have people in york estates right under your nose.  if you do <u>anything</u> except what i'm telling you, you'll get jane and amanda back in the mail.  we clear on that?
what's this?
disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
listen earl.  i covered for you. for both of you.  i put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
things do change.
leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
oh great!
i'm so sorry. i'm a coward --
i know, but this is all we've got left.
nothing, i guess.  just an observation.  she's really something special.  you're a lucky fella.
four minutes.
how's the patient?
when was that?
okay, okay!  listen-up. coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  number one, gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "physical fitness" routine...
sidney winch, meet -
yes.
wait! wait!
myra, i'm not following this.
that's his name... andy. our ticket out of here.
that's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
could you see her?
nothing personal, mrs. mulwray, i just --
are you really a bail bondsman?
do you remember anything else? what i was wearing? was i standing close to him? was i leaning against his car like i owned it? how did he look at me when i giggled? tell me everything.
yeah?
whoa!  shit, neo, you scared the bejeezus out of me.
picked up something?  what is it?
...that man's takin' his job too serious.
oh, but i'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
that is my destiny. i have a destiny, too...
oh, is that it!
alone?
better let me talk to him.
you're living on a sailboat?
yes, matter of fact.  the wife's taking a nap and... i can never keep quiet enough for her... so i thought i'd look you up and... talk.
i want you to.
what's the money for?
all three -- in chronological order.
it's okay.  we okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
why would nadelman lie?
that is your dream, not mine. my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine.
what, are you having another party?
i've heard of blue lou boyle.
i like you very much, walter.
not at all.  it taught me a little sense.  i got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the stenographic. now i'm a reader...
klingon bird of prey, sir! she's arming torpedoes...!
and listen, i'll be right back and i want your ass in that bed when i get back.
i mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what i mean, willy.
this was the reverend porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
i've been re-reading arsonist's daughter. it's so beautiful, grady. so natural. it's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in style heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
that turn you on there, rupaul?
elaine, you're a member of this crew. can you face some unpleasant facts?
maybe i ain't.
isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
now tell me the truth.
... why the mask?
you're being deliberately obtuse.
not really, no.
carla was in the car, right?
where are they?
hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, claude?
i wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, terry?
good afternoon.  i'm glad to see you up and around.
what is that, mahogany? what happens if you crack the neck?
yours.
you think i'd belive you?  believe anything you might say now?  after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past.  about my problems.  my problems.  not yours.  not his.  mine.
you can't judge him by modern standards. he's very much a product of his times. in my day he could have any woman he wanted.
let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. it's friends that count. and i got friends.
how long will we have to stay down here?
we were like sisters.  knew everything about each other.
can we talk about this when i get back?
the atmosphere.  i'm sorry.  these things slip my mind.
what?
all this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named dewitt! she apologized, didn't she?
but if you're one of the misfits... that's where i come in.
it's orange!
remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality?
you're thinking about killing him. i can't do that.  no way.  i've never killed a man.  never even shot at one.
we had...gone to a new musical called...oh africa, brave africa. it was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. i think we had dinner at orso's. no, petaluma. no, orso's. the...last time i physically saw him was...at an automated teller. i can't remember which...just one that was near, um, nell's.
not a good idea. someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. raymond, you'll steal one.
it is a little coarse, yes.
well, it wasn't exactly that way --
i never knew there were snake charmers in texas...
nothing. [getting up] thanks for bringing me this far.
don't think too badly of her... after all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
what is it you find incredible?
what?! we follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
adelle?
-- anything you want --
charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. he sure didn't. no siree.
now, thelma, that is not...
good morning, fraulein schlumberg.
aunt may, you're trespassing.
you're angry--
it's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
you bastard!
diphenyl parlene.
five this week; how many the week before?
does webb not even know we are besieged?
one of the two men was hubley, right?  what about the other one? did you know him?
and don't come back.
transplants?
show's over, boys. nobody home.
you are being rude again.
don't speak, quellek.
i have a little.
...you got brothers and sisters? what about your dad? tell me about your dad! what was he like? physically? big, i suppose?
knock it off, damone. i need real help.
autograph fiends! they're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
teddy, hon, are you okay?  oh heavens to pete!
yeah, but you know horrace. what did you get off him?
i was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  sleeping arrangements.
get me on the am shows, larry king, cover of the journal...  i've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  make sure they only shoot my right side.
you're cute, max.
bret. what the hell is going on?
jesus i've got - to get to the ho--
-- can't seem to escape you today.
well sir, i was an ironmaster before you got me.  maybe i will let you down yet.
a million years behind us.  jor-el, he's only a baby.
i want to see her.
lieutenant wills reporting to major arnold. sir.
i knew those men better than you did --
that's a lie!!
uh huh.
handbook?  when...?
c'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
go back to the m.e., take a look inside leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. trust me, there ain't chickens in the badlands. his mother's place is --
big bust!  he confiscate their water pistols?
it will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... it belonged to cimon of smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
something went wrong. system malfunction. explosion. mrs. peel had a narrow escape. suspected sabotage. nothing proven. file still open.
mr. lovejoy? that's cute, bo.
jesus christ.
y'all have a seat. is this all of you?
i didn't want to leave things the way we did.  not this time.
what do you wear in the morning?
yeah.
mm-hm.
someone tell me this is really happening.
yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. is it hard?  must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
gimme mine. i ain't staying! you know we were headed for the columbia river country before all this john doe business came up. you remember that, don't yuh?
no.
you... in the navy?
there may be things you'd rather not know about.
what are you talking about?
benjamin -- you're -- i don't know what to say -- you're --
how much is it?
69.
we do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
uh...sure...i...what?
you ever heard of gambler's ruin?
i'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. believe me, i'd prefer not to.  i may be synthetic but i'm not stupid.
they around?
yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  hell, matt, you don't need but one.
okay. thanks.
you want something to drink?
dressed up like a million dollar trouper trying hard to look like gary cooper.
she.  goes.  free.
surprised i agreed to reed's proposal?
someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
gus -- go over to berkeley. harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. carbon beth on everything.  i want some psychological input on this andrews and harrigan go; nick is left there with gus.
what's happening to you? what happened to your face?
no, not really...  i guess it's different if you don't have children, but...i dunno, even if charley and i don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if charley was to marry again...he'd still be my husband. that stuff about "till death do you part?"  that's really true.
now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. if we say move, you move. if we say left, you move left. if we say right, you move right. if we say mole, you dig a hole. got it?
bela, what happened?!
well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, i admit. but she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
i know.  i was here when your apprentice was helping you. remember?
i would.
yeah. great, isn't it?
i said: "are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
get 'em on line, then stall.  long can't have gotten far.
i don't need a baby—sitter.
let me get your change.
i hope you know what you mean to me. not just because of what you're doing. because of who you are.
i'll get some.
this is easy money, pardner... no ones gonna get hurt in this thing... and i don't think you can afford not to take it... i'll be bringin' the eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... if you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.
yeah.  sergeant jack vincennes requesting.  i need the home address on a pierce patchett.
pour us a couple.
it doesn't matter to me.  what do you mean by that?
suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. all in siwash cave. in a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. it would have to rely on its wits and its senses. it would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. it's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
the infamous dog?
...you...
who is this, enid?
we mostly publish trashy romance novels.
two years.
yeah, really. i'm no fucking asshole, man. i'm a fucking cop!
what are you doing!
breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
how long have you known my father?
why stop at coffee!  a cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
you might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
fuck 'em.  they don't know what they're missing.
let him have everything he wants.  now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  he hides, cowering... afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... and all the time they're closing in... get the sense of an animal at bay!
you mad at me?
i'm sorry, mr wladek, he wants you to stop.
... simone.
welsh again.
what nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
what are you going to do?
he's waitin' for you in the card room.
you ever miss it?
i don't know. hello, mom. hello, dad. something like that.
why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
i lost the touch
most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  i...i have to leave.  i have to move out.
do they believe in reincarnation? i believe in reincarnation.
for chrissake!  gimme a break.  the guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
rose, i don't have time for this.
what's got billy so spooked?
let me worry about that.  just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
it's just that darren and lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
dewey?
just inner chambers...
good.  so did i.  and that's all ...
oh, are you on the team?
because it's not.
i'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. could you undo a few buttons?
vince?  there's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. there's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
that's me. 
hello?
who's on television?
send it to somebody else. send it to buttle. it's his cheque.
said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
you don't?  well what's your favorite food then?
leave a tip.
you weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, i admit -- and my problem is, if i think i'm losing, i pull myself out of the game. i bail. see? i told you, i'm the love coroner.
yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
hey, can i borrow this?
he's on to a new thing. he's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. he says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
"that's not just a ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang."
i've heard it said that way.
what's vermin again?
here's what i'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
then i'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  can i see your wallet and your ticket, please?
oh, shut up, rose. shut your mouth and quit crying!
you have wonderful art. i love that lithograph. hockney?
your aunt called me.
that was way easier than i thought.
keep still.
...and what is this?
knock it off. that used to be my girlfriend.
preach on, big d.
those bastards!  that's proof enough right there of what we're up against. the whole goddamn federal government, bill!
i love my brothers.
so who's got time to get married ?
are we going to skip the country, uncle lex?
shit. you're not planning --
like what?
she's not his mama either.
we can't take a second more.
uh-oh!
please, if you'd just listen...
my plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
harold?
all they got is advertisements. just like l.a.
but that's your old hood, pops.
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command.  right?
a puppet.
all these years, happy as we've been, how i prayed and prayed he'd see fit to give us a child. and just when i finally accepted my bitter lot...  no one must ever know.
what do you mean, and be bored to death?
you don't even know me.
what?
should i let her in like - ?
and listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? you all right? okay.
sweeney.
...i s'pose you did that so i could take my sweater off or something.
that's for sure. at the airport - that's where it was. at the airport, there in one of those gift shops... anyway, you better take a break.
i didn't tell anyone i applied cause i never thought i'd make it.
can i help you?
honey!
--no, no you hear me out, sean. this young man is a true prodigy--
is this what it's like to love somebody?
my daddy lets me sit on his lap.
sure is tasty.
marcus!
aw, long john . . . i tell you—it's no good. you're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. and don't pull that on me neither! 
that was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
you got it!
i give up.
father, lad.
someone’s trying to kill me. i need the police.
i don't beg.
you're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
can i write down my address and phone number for you?
at the houmfort.
give it to me!
white's a mindless thug.
good lord.  what do you study in history?
yeah? but look at you.
what?
well, hello.
earlier this afternoon, the emperor refused the hand of the grand duchess anna, of russia, and, as i'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  for the emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
who is "they?"
i see you knew him.
what?
and many meatballs.
i didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on tv.
no, not at all.
fred. the way he looked when you screamed at him.
tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
maybe i better ask around, see what your pals think.
shhh! i heard you the first time.
how would i know? you think i'm some sort of...
what?
fucking.  she says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
you're in gun country now, my friend.
who?
don't call me antoine. my name is wally.
who is frank?
egypt is in my blood. my father was a famous explorer, he loved egypt so much that he married an egyptian. my mother! who was quite an adventurer herself
-- you just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  she certainly doesn't need you.  some people even say you're holding her back.
there was a man, poet--a theatre poet, i heard--does he come to the house?
i never said he was faking! i never said that!
no, it's not here.  this one was different.  more like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
okay, i want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
oh, i see. he was having trouble and you were helping him out.
did... you... get... him?
i could subpoena him if i had a week.
and it snuffled the ground like a dog.
two.
they are dead.  in either case --
no... go on.
in my apartment?
what's that?
we've got such sights to show you --
i guess i ... if i jumped to...
i don't know...
wait a second. he knows i know.
it's the ship. the ship's making you think this way.
how do you do it?
do you know this man?
shut up! shut the fuck up, both of you, before i kill you!
touche.
mom?
there's nothing for me to do here anymore... i don't belong here i want to be with him now...
play it again.
tell me a joke funny man. hee hee.
this is funny.
as a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
look, i can see where this is going.  but i'm telling you those things exist.  back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  thousands. do you understand?  i suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
what did he say?
so what's the problem?
did jenny know?
i doubt that.
no, i don't think so.  that's someone else.
where have they gone?
poor thing.
sure -- i don't even feel it.
hail the all-knowing bruce wayne. here's what i know, she loves me, not you and it's driving you crazy. it's why you stopped us from kissing. because if you can't have her, nobody can.
general, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. the thought of any of my children going hungry...  who's the cutest widdle worker?  you are!  yes, you!  don't forget to brush your teeth!  ship 'er out.  what steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
mr. smith has been waiting for you and mrs. trueworthy. can you take care of mr. smith now?
did you call the state police?
love is different for different people.
what was that?
alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
no, salvatore. you'd better go. it's my father.
adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in epping forest, didn’t he? seemed like a good idea. an ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. he just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery english november. an englishman might have thought of that, but a brazilian...
what did i say about mentioning that bitch?
alright, i'm here. now what?
oh, that thing. yeah. did you hear about this?
which way are you going?
i'm not. believe me. <u>i'm</u> scum.
i don't believe it.  he's clean!
i wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
did you carry a gun?
i don't think so. it's on all the cameras, and check this out. the thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
his escape.
he's in this somehow... i don't know how.  just stay close to faith.
we're hooked!
no, you don't.
yes, goddammit!
i'm sorry... i don't know either. i just don't know.
you see, a tree is a living thing.
i have this effect on lots of women.
it's okay.  this is working.  this is gonna work.
vada!! vada runs and jumps into phil's arms look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! how are you? you look great, how's shelly? your dad?
go home.
that's not so.
what can i do for you mr....watson?
i'm just trying to get in my house!
you don't forget anything, do you?
i'm no bodyguard.
no, i promise...  not a chance. i own this guy. there was no one else. i'm on the move too much. trust me.
condition?
i don't like to do what people expect. then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
holy shit.
you all sure about this?
oh, jesus!!
why you gotta say a thing like that.
mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. i'm confused. what's changed?
oh god, that stuff stinks.
i am not going to cliff's trailer.
don't say it that way. say it as if you meant it.
you getting out too?
so. you and debi. gonna hit that shit again?
goodbye, bobby.
because when i scheduled it i didn't realize it was a holiday.  you were there, why didn't you say something?
take 'er on down, al. i'll sign.

i don't recall.  memories of the war, perhaps.
no. i married a midget.
then you get it.  you'll understand.
such a sad face... you know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
because this must be stopped.
-all but one out of a hundred, i know.  all left to be led like donkeys back home.  now if you will please-
i don't know.  he made me see the stars ...
it came yesterday.  i haven't opened it yet.
my room!
stop fighting and get out.
were you ever in poughkeepsie?
i don't want you to get involved, really, i mean, i do, but if something went wrong i mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
good evening. it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary.
see?
two boxes of double-ought buck.
what does he mean, too correct?
keep pulling... away from the ship. pull.
no...
you gotta go with it. scary movies are great foreplay.
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
honest to god, ruben!
oh, good. there's jessica.
i've done nothing and for that i am ashamed.
like what?
i'm a tourist.
it's just the shock of seeing me after three years. believe me, you'll get over it.
i was in luh-love with her.
mike, good to see you.  got everything you want?
i don't know. i just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  it works.
all the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  tan resigned and went over to the triads openly.
daisy. how did you know?
i don't care, just get me there.
if i don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
are you ready to go?
whose side are you on?
no.  shit.
he gives me a total boner!
how clear is manchester?
are you threatening me, because i'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
i'd be gentle as a lizard --
number two. i saw the yellow man come out. this time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. they drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. number three. now get this. in the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
sure, daniel.
trouble with your air-conditioning.
if macrosystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand americans will be out of work. moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit macrosystems is trying to pull.
this much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. it's got to be smuggled.
she's not going to notice, anthony.
may i ask where you’re from, mr lamont?
i don't know... please... tell me i'm dead...
kelly... relax.  take one of your mom's valium or something.  in another week you get on the plane.  it's over.  we're rich.
how can you watch this crap?
-- what trial?
that's right.  now,  move!
right up there over the vice- president's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. you've met the press bunch, haven't you?
now it seems to me --
i'm serious --
hello, i'm candy gulf.
all i wanted... was to make it home... for a little of dad's turkey, and mom's stuffing... aunt lisbeth's acorn gravy... aunt mary's cranberry buns...
well, darling, if it gets any better than that, i'm going to have to bring you up here to new york.
i'11 find him.
hey, ros.  nice view, huh?
and the alley was a mistake.  never corner yourself like that.  if they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  one vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
i saw that look on your face just now. what's between you and wyatt?
i hate her!
shut up, before you lose them all!
chicken salad.
peter...
tomorrow morning. ten o'clock.
i can't do that.
patrick?
whoa.  name's hawkins, eddie hawkins. my nickname's hudson hawk, but don't call me hudson, not even as a joke. the nuns at st. agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what i am today. not a compliment...
where does she live?
my god.
here, find my hand.  the stairs are right near here.  i saw them.  let's just walk up there.
that ain't bad.
ya nose is broke.
are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
you can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. and tell them where he's going.
you think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
what are we gonna hear?
you know, i don't think so. i'm confused but you know, i don't think he'd ever hurt me. i don't think he'd hurt anyone.
and they won't be able to tell?
are you going to plead insanity?
isn't that what you want us to believe?  that we're completely defenseless?  that you know what's best?
actual. terrorists? well ... it's only my first day.
mother!
i don't mention that anna's a vegetarian, did i?
i was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
sheerotards. catchy name, isn't it? like leotards.
look, i'm sure this'll amuse you too. ilia trying to get away from all that.
am i right?
oh my g-d, they want me to anchor.  they want me to anchor tonight!
three days.
this whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
but professor --
ed, all i'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
there....
i don't think it was them.
it's not pat. it's jim.
hey, stu, why so glum? everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
oh, what was the name of that doctor? harry's doctor?
rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
for what?
no.
so?
paxcow says it's almost too late!
to make sure you’re okay.
always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  i think, suzette, i have never been so tired in my life.  veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
anything?
stacy, don't hang up.
what do you mean -- gone?  what the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
it's only been a week. keep sending him up.
why have we stopped?
it doesn't make sense. these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
...these guy'll back you up.
your husband! mrs. robinson! there's something we could have a conversation about.
cast stood me up.
let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
anything...a feeling...a smell..?
my lady mocks me.
it's not what you think it is.
could i tell him what it's regarding?
i used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, i was shredding documents in the basement.  deep down, i guess i was just jealous.  you were one incredible thief...
ellen.
but there's one thing. the desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. i mean -- i don't know what their policy is -- but --
you fuckin' wish.
almost three.
sorry, miss. beer and ale only. canadian law.
in your honor, nigel. and you and singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
he calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
i thought for hours about whether carmelita should accept bernard's marriage proposal . . .
oh, this is betty.
have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, anne marie?
my name is harley -- secretary to the president  i've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is mr. klaatu.
are they following us?
what are you saying?
really? that's a very good book. it'd make a terrific --
that would explain the bruises, i guess.  the struggle.
you were the one who got me in.
what happens in tow and a half hours?
my westley will always come for me.
i've seen it twice. i went back tonight to be sure. it's a brave and honest piece of work.
well aren't you the smoothie. now you're going to ask for my number, i suppose.
the whole thing is my fault. i took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. you understand me.
show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
'i' will tell you what is boring.  once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  what's on the third floor?
thank christ for that.
hello?
they're nobody's fans! they're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
i heard voices downstairs.  is everything alright?
i flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. the one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
why not? you had a perfectly good motive.
stop it!  stop it!
i swear to you, argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one i ever build.
major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  major!
if i die, you'll know where to look for me?
c'mon, cobb...you're slacking...
what?!?
you're on leave, man.  you're on psycho leave.  i'm talking to a possible whacko here.
that what we're doing?  flowing?
watch it, heather. you could actually be digesting food.
aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
out of here.
jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
in a  wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, rothstein followed several...
you may not <u>win</u> them.  but without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
i watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing this night. he's waited for it, inhumanly patient. hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. you can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now. that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
about yourself?
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
you've known me five years elmer. when do you get to calling me david?
we'll go into that some other time.
no, really.
walter. when i fill out my 302, do i say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
mr. thatcher, isn't everything i've been saying in the enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
i don't know who you are. i'd like to thank someone.
sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
there's nothing to tell.
good.
what we have to do is call the police.
says here you done real good in the war: silver star, bronze star, couple purple hearts. sergeant! little time in stockades. come out the same way you went in: buck private.
i was dubious myself at first. then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the sankara stones...
what if -- you know -- it's not the night?
if she's telling  you the truth.
you invest in shows?
you?
they send us to zammito's house. the fbi is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. a crime is going down and they don't move. why?  because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
yes, i do have something to say.  i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs. christian contacted you.
vodka tonic.
you won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the commencement speech at wharton.
mrs. mulwray?... mrs. mulwray.
i had to give some to inez.
hey -- what's he like?
say you're feeling faint - the sun.
my god, an actual operating 8-track.
i think you got no choice.
no, we have to do it. but later, allright?
because i really suspect gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
you get a new fence.
mm hmm.
heather chandler, kurt kelly, and rupert "ram" sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: values, ambition, and hope.
what? what do you want?
is that what you are angry about?
i think it was a little more complicated than --
under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
get up, billy.
groom-  - may i have a wedding present?
you were? you mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
how am i supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
you don't trust me.
what's that mean?
promise me one thing.
at dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. things are very bad in my house.
apparently i'm not as dumb as you thought i am.
my fuckin' head.
what...?
in detroit. this weekend.
do you like me better?
aw, nuts! you're just like your old man!  once a plumber always a plumber! there isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
you on some kind of work plan?
for the first time in i don't know how long.  i wanted everything done right. open and above board.  i told father antonelli i was in love.  i told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
what was that dell, i lost you, do you read me?
suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. it's my house, you know.
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
you know her?
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. i gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
our daughter? is that what you said? our daughter? i mean, you might have a daughter, but i sure as hell don't. and even if i did -- which i don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
no.
that's lisa - i gotta get to school.
really! still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. what was her purpose in that?
i couldn't prevent it.
this is number 50. we did it. it's over where's the money ?
hey, josie, hold on.  you've been hiding something from me.
my kid brother has one.  you know why?
polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in avril bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges. i couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
nekhorvich's boss?
yeah.
he told enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
oh excuse me, i didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. are you a doctor? are you a doctor? answer me please, are you a doctor?
thank you, sir. i was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
<u>me</u>!
but you were there?
hello -- hello! is this the lying -- in hospital? did you have an auto accident in the last --
keep what handy?
the prime directive doesn't apply. these people are not indigenous to this world. they were never meant to be immortal. we'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
i know, dad.
... and we work my hours.  i'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. you gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
landon. you go on home.
i'm really rooting for this one.
no.  why don't you cover it up walter...
go on.
lieutenant o'neil.
the dolphin was a symptom.
what, is it the stairs? christ, i'll let you win next time.
kind of isolated.
yeah .. i guess she's in the kit- chen .. we got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
i've known katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  i think i'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  i think she's know herself.
what is it you want? what?
i'm sorry. sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and jason had a sore throat.  your big graduation, and no one was there.
then she wasn't in the car.  <u>say</u> it.
good day to you, sir.
let me go!
or how about a game of pinochle? no, you're not a pinochle man. you're a chess player.  i haven't played since i was a kid. let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? and a bishop this way? and the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
i'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
come on, sweetheart...
that's the rub.
so how long am i supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
a dressing bag?
do you really believe me?
hello. uh. my name is jeffrey beaumont. is detective williams in?
you weren't home.  like always.
well, it being so depressing and all.  but it's reality.  you can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
this is really happening, isn't it?
what if i brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  would that eliminate some of your concerns?
then we don't know that god was white.
oh no you can't. get on with the painting.
why don't you use the phone downstairs?
think i may have cracked it.
everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
this is more than you are used to. your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  you have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  don't look so surprised, kings know such things.
that's a great idea.
well, i'm next. you won't hear anything like that, mr. galbraith.  i'm not a popular favorite since i let the leopard loose.
it didn't used to be that way.
sixty seconds, then i'm out of here.
could work with a new switch. there may be a few more things hidden.
you know what i'm talking about.
and people close to him, who --
this'll work, huh?
brian?
will he find us and kill us? yes... or one of the others.  you know there's only one place to go now...
i thought you'd think it was crazy.
rayisha. very nice.
if you've got a gun on you, price, i'd hand it over now.
he's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
you're lying.
sounds good.  kim, would you get heather and me a coffee?  how you like it, hon?
no it doesn't. i see right through you.
she doesn't need to know.
i've seen one of these before. a friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. away to fuck the irs. is that what you're doing, or are you the real mccoy?
adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
on january 1st, 1814, france itself was invaded.  now, with a small army of raw recruits, napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of england, russia, prussia and austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  the balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
i want to stand for what i believe in, father.
the prowler in hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
this? this is a joke.  i'll give your group a thousand bucks.
but you're not going anywhere, are you?
caesar, you still got the money?
the unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
i could give you reasons. her silence. her youth. it's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
i don't want to be in any competition... i dive because i like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
i'm not pregnant.  i'm hot.  i'm too hot.
was there a priest?
this.
so... lemme get this straight.  we got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  we got information no one else in the world is privy to.  and we're in a 1986 ford ltd about to go look at an insect?
embezzling ? i'm not embezzling !
he wants to reward you... that's why i'm here.
you know about adele.
and i want to turn the home over to the state.
you wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.

i knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
yes. what do you mean?  what's wrong?
what he needs is a dose o' salts!
yeah, the lot's right there. my truck is right out back.
oh - there were three of us.  the others flew back in my plane.  i don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
i'm talking to you red and i'm telling you no. get back to your position.
stay calm, ray. we'll find him. claude! has anyone seen claude?
she's losing it!
please --
i mean completely played.  until he's beat and the score is taken. you come in before we beat him and i'll kill him.  you'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
i'm not sure, but...
i'm not a theater checker. i'm a call girl.
why?
<u>i'll</u> have to drive!
let's have you.
yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
anything i want!  now that's interesting.
i'm fine.
i'm getting nowhere.  the whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  i think we should go after them.
it certainly is.
i was nervous, that's all! where is the guy?
i have no claim, thomas.
if that's not a drop or a pickup, i'll open a charge for you at bloomingdale's.
sure. what's with the brick wall?
i don't think i should have opened my big mouth. sorry, ho-jon.
what else can i think after a tale like that?  good heavens, bob, things like that don't happen today. we're living in the twentieth century.
three syllables.
yeah, i'm doing fine.  i have so much to tell you.  i don't even know where to begin.
i told you, that's a secret.
here comes the fbi.  you men lookin' for protection?  we got all the police right here.
where's the cloak invisible?
this is the home of an angel.
i said i'd consider it. nobody owns me. and the last thing was insane. i don't know what's wrong with him... no magazines.
haven't you forgotten something?
aha.  james giving some woman the old heave-ho.
let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
lainey, you know simone and i don't have a real relationship.
come on, montgomery...
oh, make that uniform blue.
yes. leave the country. tonight.
you <u>are</u> kareem. i've seen you play. my dad's got season tickets!
but you weren't. i could tell.
so tell me about it.
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. all those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
doctor. ear, nose and throat man,.

please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
alright, let's give it another try.
put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. that's partly why i was in custody so long. sixty days.
mr. howard is so heinous.  he's always giving me a hard time.  i get a c-plus on the test and he tells me, 'you have no sense of history.'  i have no sense of history?  he wears a brown tie.
god of passages and changes?
very generous of you all.  how much?
mr. harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
what do you mean?
we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
i can't hold out on you any longer. lamb bites wolf.  beautiful.
chicago.
luke, you probably don't remember me, roscoe fitts, i'm the grocer here in town.
don't do anything stupid.
closer?!
you're jumping to conclusions.
i have to leave. tonight.
looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
have you got it now?
yeah.
release the sharks!  all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. i figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
that's it.  pull over.  i'm drivin'.
who, for instance?
no, no, no!  you got it all wrong, potato head.  buzz is fine!  buzz is right here.  he's with me!
i know how it is.
i don't have it here. at the mille collines. i can get it for you.
goodnight vada.
then i demand an apology!
what's the furthest you been in?
yeah, but they're not watching yachts. come on - you're going to call osgood.

may i...?
dinner's in the warmer.  tell your father i may be late.
she giving you any carfare for the ride?
no, sir.
we're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
what's with the boxes?
why are you doing this?
listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
she's getting big.  getting her own ideas.
leave her out of this.
wallace has sacked york!
yes, yes, and definitely yes. also... i get confused.

i'm not.
huh?!  oh, uh, no, i didn't get the job. but something <u>better</u> happened!

running your broker scam, you mean.
it must've been very hard on erica?
don't be dense. the party.
he was a runner for top dollar. just muscle.
the price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. but you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. i'll just let you out here.
you're hurt...
i must. besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
your father dropped off an extra check.
howard ... what the hell?  what're you doing?
i've got secondaries of an engine fire and i'll need to find a clear area to eject.
i'm sure she did.
it's rude to talk about religion. you never know who you're going to offend.
just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
okay, mr. expert. if this is such a truism, how come every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
anything to do before i go home?
take the boss loading, kid. for god's sake. i don't want to hurt you.
how would you like it if i did that to your mother's panties?
get out.
we sure do.  i don't mean it as a knock either.  go ahead.  i'll just say what i think and you can disregard it if you want.
so what else is new?  look eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for tamara mason. wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
three months.

told you it was your lucky day. bet you thought i was just a fan or something.
how is the children's progress?

i know that answer.  if we went to trial would we win?
how many times i gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
um -- not right now.
i told you, i ...
you don't recognize me.
yeah.
i think somewhere between roderick bledsoe's club and his house, wade ran into buddy deeds. i think buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the sheriff's car and drove him out by the army post, i think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
you.
wait a minute -
what am i doing here?
mrs. ackerman, do you recycle?
good old paden. i was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
you trust me?
what the fuck!
yes?
you didn't care about my case?
no. doesn't that suck?
sit back.  put your seatbelt on.
oh, look, i mean, it's kind of the last thing... i mean, i'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so i couldn't really er ...
how did the fire fight end?
now it's your turn.
leave stephen out of this --
sorry, luv.  i've got a date.
we're out of money, partner.. we wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... how come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  you got two of them...?
i got suspended when i was young, too. i was pretty cocky in my day.
okay...take your time...i'll...i'll go for a walk around.
chief -- the board of selectmen has a question only you can answer.
letty, dinner's almost ready.   the souffle...

anna, i'm faith.  you don't know how happy i am to meet you.  you see, i'm trying to find someone, and--
i accept, but i insist on a wager. the loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
if you don't stay with me, i'll have to continue my fight. i'll travel wherever russian commissions are. i'll turn them all into buljanoffs, iranoffs, and kopalskis. the world will be crowded with russian restaurants. i'll depopulate russia. once you saved your country by going back. this time you can save it by staying here.
it's a stunt. humans don't write.
yes. i love eve very much.
jesus god, auggie. there's money in here.
grandma, look at me!
i don't know, booth.
stand up.
there's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
you too, preacher?
i was a friend of your sister's.
you expect to hold cornwallis with militia?
nick, what are you --
i thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
because if a supervisor knew i'd seen you and i hadn't reported it, i'd lose my job as well. and i can't afford that.
why do i have to do this?
look, if you can get them to finish it by friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
do you agree with ben, mr. gardiner? are we finished? or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
the questions have already been asked. i would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
good morning, sir. agent salinas, sir.
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
if this was some sort of joke, i'm going to kill him.
maggie!
what do they need her for?
so the mask is part of the down payment too. must be a really big job.
that's alright.
all right then.
so how are things at the hospital?
there's talk of that.
everything. i have a good head for business, i should be franchising the bakery. and i want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. and finish.
where is he?
do you love her?
you've never built in africa.
not.
our readers are, anyway, i don't know about the rest of the country.
i meant biologically.
what?!
i assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
i wouldn't. if i were in his shoes, every morning i'd get up singing, man. do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of coors lite. then i'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather victoria secret custom-made bodysuit. so i'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. and then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching gilligan.
it's in the process.
bed wetter!
... hmmm... elevator.
what do we owe our governments? yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
my daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  i'm going to move in with her.
she's in the elevator heading toward ethan.
come on. tell us, shitface.
you do understand i can't just give you new irises.  the scanners will read the scar tissue.  alarms will go off.  large men with guns will appear...
what do you want me to do?
i haven't seen you since the wedding, jeez, you look great.
too bad for meng, but it's not your fault, or li mu bai's.
talley.
what do you mean, never? well what have they got it for, then?
you idiot!  asta! stop that!  get down!  now, stay there.
no i.... andy, you can't be sure.
you really believe that?
and tomorrow?
i'll find a way to contact the enterprise. you're going to be all right.
i'd like to come with you.
land reform is underway in amdo. the large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. landlords are being punished.
i don't know. both. my plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. come with me.
i hear they're closing that post down.
i'm your valet, sir. dawson is the name, sir.
you know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
it was made clear.  anyway, stay ballsy.  first week's hell, then it levels out.  until s.e.r.e. training, anyway.  that's hell-and-a-half.
i can see what you looked like as a kid.
what's what?  oh, that.  just a little going away present.
he's already angry, i don't think --
is it over if they arrest you now?
why me? what about jay?
what he said..."there's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
my little niece... she got this deep cough.
that's it.  back to obedience school.
detective bedsoe.
isn't it beautiful?!!
dickson's in a jam i tell you. the run's getting worse.
no. he would be a hard man to find, jerry. particularly if he were a clever men. he would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
good to see you again, mr. grey.  i've got to go find dan.
all right boy: where's the money?
shame you had to spot i wasn’t the real thing.
will he be back soon?
i'd keep that thing close just in case, if i were you... i've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
is it going well?
i'm looking for deejay rob gordon.
ram asked me out, but he wants to double with kurt and kurt doesn't have a date.
you had all those cattle there, so i'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
whatcha looking at?
no, there's another point i want to iron out.
yeah.
help me, jack! i'm frightened!
they told me you wanted to talk about this shane business.
but, in project mayhem, we have no names.
mr. rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, dr. arroway. feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
ha!
i think it's time discuss your career path. have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
hm hmm. what did you have for dinner?
excuse me?
are you gettin' wise with me?
no. precisely. we begin by coveting what we see every day. don't you feel eyes moving over your body, clarice? i hardly see how you couldn't. and don't your eyes move over the things you want?
i like that girl. that quality of quiet graciousness...
she's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
i almost forgot.  that pal of yours from the vice squad wants you to call him.
do you know why he's called buffalo bill? tell me. the newspapers won't say.
is something wrong?
you have children?
keep it to yourself.
what's troubling ya, buddy?
we got her mother's bed. you two got the rest.
well he's taken an interest!  that means he'll make your life hell, which i could care less about, but since i drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, i covered for you. told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. i told him it was great, so now my ass is on the line.  he wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
neither do i.  what's the one with the woodsman?
personally, i think it's stupid!  but go ahead. have a good time. as long as ellie doesn't object.
do you?
just let it go, i've got you!
really, now is not the time to make waves.
i'm sorry, baby. what can i do'?
nothing for him! he's being repressed.
i think so... what about you?
i never could believe that tom was a split personality. i never believed he was a dumper; and i don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and i don't believe he's alive.
what's the matter, baby? don't you like being kissed?
the experiment. the danger...
i can understand that.  everyone feels that way about someone.
charlie...?
not even mutual of omaha thinks so anymore.
<i>                      that's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
what do you mean?! i could leave him if i wanted to!
well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
have you got what i want?
the more things change, the more they goddamned well stay the same.
i don't know.  if it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  it was still searching for meaning...
what?
enough.  it's better.  please, lambchop, it's better.  stop. you're hurting it again.
alex.
i ain't a idiot, asshole.
not from me, you piece of shit. there is no immunity from me. you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. every criminal i have put in prison,
ah, so that's it.  to you i'm just a girl.
ray--
i road them often in my youth.
yeah... how do you know it?
oh g-d, i'm sorry... you're not really fat!  i was just saying that because, uh, i thought that's what you wanted me to say.
left you?
what's a'matter?
no, but they took my blender.
how could you know my father? you don't even know who i am.  can't we get on with this already?
come on, jane- it was brady's idea. i couldn't stop him.
what do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
it's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
seattle.
if that child comes here...if i find her trying to steal your love from me...i'll kill her. yes, i'll kill her:
you're gonna be there! we're getting outta here! take it!
wait...  she's crying. i finish. i hold up my finger like "wait a second". they sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. i look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. even the camera guy.
michael!  this thing working?
let me ask you a related question. we've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  what is your policy for treating addiction?
what's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
these things are wild...  what do you think?
i have aids.
who are you?
and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
ah, but you're forgetting one thing, lambchop.
i'm freaking out. i'm like an animal and totally out of control. my arms keep getting really hairy.
it's fifty cents admission. it's applicable to a purchase.
we're ready with the shot, mr. demille.
he's special.
i knew you'd do all right. well, i just wanted to check on you. i'll say bye to bill and get on back.
video.
i know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
i know, but it wasn't all bad was it? i think you found it quite pleasurable.  oh so soft.  so sensual.
like what?
soon as i finish.
did he tell you about georgina?
julia!
just in case someone gets a shot off.
we're supposed to be honest.
we never would have had this conversation.
me! jim--how--?
i said he hadn't written me.
i was eating that.
come, toddy -- come.  sit down here with me.
um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
just a few questions?
and this?
gotta be another way up, frank.
beth?  now you've got beth killing people?
cow.
beautiful, beautiful.  work with me, baby. just have fun with it.  okay, he's playing it cool.  let's finish up and get out of here.
...yeah. but two's enough not to look anxious...
shut up.
yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
what's going on?
don't talk like that. how prominent? what are you implying?
clarence, i've got something to tell you. i didn't just happen to be at the theater. i was paid to be there.
what do you mean? i remember everything!  hand me my pants - i wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
dr. marcia fieldstone of network america.
what would your girlfriend think of that?
i found it, evy! i found it
rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl i've ever known and --
convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
we think you should give up the magazine. sell it. let someone else run it. whatever it takes.
no, man. it wrinkles my shit. let's grab a fuckin beer --
shit. it's thirty-five cents. you got a dime?
where's bella?
let her go, cin.
you will not, then?
is it true?
nothing.  i guess i just wanted to thank you.
appreciate something.
over three-hundred.
his parents took his car.  they're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
i don't mean to be a prick, but that's how i feel.
i want more action. i want to see more ingenuity than that. i want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
i said the record is destroyed. the original report exists for all time.  i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
you're a bad loser.
a what?
kick a buck.
right.
say it
you always told me you couldn't do human...
what's the trouble?
you got it!
hey, now wait a sec...
... nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
you couldn't handle shit.  you just better come through with some kind of payment on tuesday...anything. understand?  hold onto your pay- check this week.
you just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  and some money... talk to max.  he's been in the longest.
show me della!
i don't know.
i'm sorry. you understand i don't mind dying if i could save my daughter. i mean that.
yeah!
and what's he do?
that would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  you don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
pretty good, too. lots of detail. nothing hard core. old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
how long will you be?
they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards, killing several of them. then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
...you know?  i, uh...
yes i do.
i don't believe this is happening...
why not?
not even close. hell, we can't even make syria or iraq.
where the hell do you think you're going?
yes, this afternoon. i was grilling ann about your marriage this afternoon.
all right.
you said we would be safe in philadelphia.
you want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
penelope!
yes. and no more evasive tactics.
what is bruce doing ?
where's kumar?
love him... yes, it is true. that's the hard part for me... i knew him better than anyone ... i knew him best.
wow. you're a walking felony.
you could always make it up to her.
oh, my god...
stop that, will you!  those idiots! so they sprang dunbar! so what good is it? he's still in the compound, isn't he? how long can he last? where can they hide him?
what do you want me to do? just sit here and wait? faithful little sarah. pull the shades down and sit. when you feel like coming back, you'll come back. and you'll love me. and then you'll go away again. is that your idea of love?
board meeting. oh, that means hours, i suppose.
this is my old friend carol.. i told you about her.
'big'?
i also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
"both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with elijah muhammad since 1957..."
i can get it, yeah.
they've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. people throw up in the streets. others point guns. there's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and i...i can't tell you the rest.  i just can't.
what do you say, hoffy. we'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of barracks nine.
it will end tonight.
outside of a beehive, margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!

roy?
he's dead, lara.
really?  you seriously want to go with me?
it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... what a waste...
mr. webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
i'm finished at three.  no.  squash with stan.
what's happening? what's going on?
listen, americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  you take a little and then come back.
in the still...still of the ni-ight...i held you...held you so ti-ight...
you know how i feel about you.  you know how much i need you.  how much i trust you.  i would do anything for you.
can i get you something to drink?
i think you might just want to do as i say.
the damn lock's broken again.  and so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? is that your game?
really.
...hey chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
you bastard.  you fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
no.  johnnie's got it.  all i got to do is get it back.
i would feel nothing about my life? is that what you want to hear?!
what was that about?
oh, nothing much. just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. if you don't want me to run it --
...stupid things.
that was something. i'm ed crane.
listen, i have to shoot cedar bridge until a little after sunset. i want a few night shots. would you like to come with me? if you're interested...
this is a bunch of bullshit.
hey, i'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
mike!  mike, can you hear me?
i can't believe we're stealing a plane.
nine months?  what difference does that make?
they're going to come to everyone.
just like you would be.
in there.
i don't know.
human children can be very beautiful.  getting married?  congratulations. you will be taking sunday off, then...
yes, mam...
no disrespect, tommy, but why would mr. arnold rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
mick. mick. mick...
it wouldn't hurt to put it in.
good of you to stop by.
i'll need that.
okay. mix.
look, i didn't mean to hurt anybody... god, i didn't mean to... to...
no, sir. i'm waiting for a lady.
my mission was a success, sir. i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation.
nice job.
you're a smart boy, charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. a man needs a family.
mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
my ass if falling.
it's this darned corset. it binds. he retrieves the stick.
you know, mr. m., when i win the presidency, that means you and i are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  and i for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. wouldn't you?
i don't want you to hurt me.
ah, hello. my name is kenneth fraser... and i'm here from terre haute, indiana. ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
bob...
what's up with you?
you ain't from oz.  oz is in that movie.
is this what you call the "butler"?
it's a little early to celebrate.
you're judge right? we need to talk.
you're kidding --
get out of here!
but he's not quite the same guy anymore. don't get your hopes too high?
you got a chisel round here?
i'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
he's an american, you know. dr. hirsch is going to fetch round one of those embassy fellows to see him.
your last chance. take the money.
it's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
what? oh! i see! it's st. phillips. oh, of course. why... why that's very good, i mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
sharon's far from a slut.
no, i'd already sent them home. you can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that i'll get it back soon using my own methods.
oh, don't do this!
where you been keeping yourself? i told john must be cold if stamp stay inside.
nothing!  i didn't hurt him.  <u>he</u> bit <u>me</u>!  this is <u>my</u> blood!
where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
well, what's the difference, anyway?
what about a drink on the way home?
i don't know, he had a meeting or something.
here, i got it.
i think i'll go see debi today.
god, sailor... that's the night my daddy died.
willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if raziel's wrong?
ok. 
oh yeah?  what was 'fascinating' about it?
back -
bandit ii?
it's no disgrace, kid. that spin was hell. it would wreck anyone's confidence. you could be a good pilot again someday...
tis not the time to speak of cheer.
with their shields down it might be possible.
sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... you seem like an entirely different person ...
i know you as well as i know myself, shinzon. there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
i need something tangible. to hook him. i told him i'd found the confidential file on the suspect zero theory.
what did you want under the bed?
boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
you told them, didn't you?
not just any carbohydrates, mind you. it was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  we should get a strobe on this thing. maybe even a siren.
good idea. meantime, try to get a feel for catherine martin. her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. i'm going to the other two clinics, minnesota and ohio.  now's the hardest part, starling. use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. just keep your eyes on catherine. we've got less than 30 hours.
can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
murder willie? in my heart, he was our child. victor's and mine. such a thing could never have entered my mind.
i haven't any hard feelings.
i'm just talking.
keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. she doesn't know we're sexually active.
get lost, you scared me.
things pretty tough for you at home?
sorry.
he's around.
you like mysteries that much?
you're a fool, babe.
you miss him, don't you?
i wish i was your wife. i wish i had your kids.
i'm sure you've probably heard that i want to ask you, but i'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. i know we didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
major, that's not a good argument. if dr. furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. that's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
what did you say?
ah, yes.
might i ask why?
yeah well, they want a lot for their money. they want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." we've got to give them something. they'll kill me if i don't. and the panthers are going to kill me if i do. i'm scared.
don't call me old man.  ain't you got no respect, boy?
it's under your seat.
p.d. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
where's your partner, the jumpy one? why isn't he here?
are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? what you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! and you won't be able to take care of them, either. there's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
the man is a psychopath, your honor.
i was just trying to say thank you to diane and frank and --
you're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
have you ever shot a man?  how many times have you been primary through the door?
people thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
ma'am.  your husband, bernie.  you didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
jesus, bob.
i can't do it, rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and i ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
hey, make up your mind, will you?
mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
a hired player no longer. fifty pounds, will, for the poet of true love.
would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
no --
i doubt that.
i'd better get back now.
there's so many...
but you'll do it?
i'm saying, i see what you're getting at, dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which i'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
the bond for possession is only a thousand.
well--uh--yes and no.
i know who's trying to kill you.
i didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  jesus.  look at me. what do i have this afternoon?
yes, yes.  to obi-wan you listen young one.  the tree.  remember your failure at the tree!  heh?
how you feeling?
who's this?
no jewelry! hands off jewelry! if we're broke--all right. i might pick up a million-franc necklace. but in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry?
are you going to leave me too?
that's just worries me. a bit too long to long to be reasonable. you're about due now by my reckoning, that's why i'm warning you, little alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. do i make myself clear?
helping you, sir?
no.
yes? yes, you do have more experience?
you do until six p.m.
i guess it's not really fighting. she just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
what happened to you?
lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
right.  we have the same blood type...
i didn't know how to tell you.  a couple brokers stopped in for stoley spritzers one night.  next thing i know fast track digest votes us "watering hole of the month."  now, i'm shopping for aqua salmon wallpaper.
i'm telling you now.
it's not your fault.  mike, please get off the case.
very.
ginger... it means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. now, i -
oh, no.  the fan club is real.  but they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
i think that was farther west in the sierras.
are you here?
i'll give it my best shot.
why, matt!
this one's for both of us.
what are they?
my father is a rear admiral in the seventh fleet.
man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "you gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or i'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  to be like that, i don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  open your eyes in the morning?  i don't think you do...i don't think so...  i think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  in your estimation of yourself.  so how'd you get that way...?
we make them see what we wish.
we're late.
sartorius wants to destroy it.
no...i thought i'd take you to the hospital.
you want a drink?
can't he come out for one day?
i'll consider it.
no, i didn't think so.
i saw his tamburlaine, you know. wonderful.
dad!
you supposed to be a wounded vet, motherfucka. what you do in 'nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
i'm afraid you will have to move room.
that's all taken out of context. okay.
...we're saved!
oh, jake. you disappoint me. and you just let lily here down again. what was it you said about playing the big con?
can i have my gun back?
spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
there has to be.
you burn in bell.  you burn in hell and you deserve it -- you get the fuck out.
wait a minute. wait a minute. lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on christmas eve? is that it?
dristan nasal spray.
would you tell me if you had?
nothing.
ed, who is daniel davis?
three million.  i counted it twice.
how many?
in the dark... where i join him...
yeah, i guess so.
you couldn't do it, period.
we don't have to do it that way. we can catch him this time.
you've been around.
she wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. she also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
what's that?
hey baby...
six feet -- seven -- eight --
ah, see, that's the thing. somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
but i like to... and i don't smoke that much.
right home after.
what'd ned say?
yes, dear. you forgot all about it.
george, i am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  could you please not give me a hard time about it?
carefull those are dirty words! you sound like a bunch of new york critics.  thank you, miss schaefer.
definitely no comment.
yeah.
so.  what happens now?
oh man, that's the best.
i hate to be a bother, john, but the cramp's getting worse.  the pain is actually quite unbearable now.
i've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but i couldn't convince myself to stop. this 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
-- the train for marseilles leaves at five o'clock. i'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
course not. he ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. he's there 'cause he back sassed a free man. they got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. he's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.

ah... peter finch.
what are you doing?
and you have this letter of intent?
doug?
three men dead.  one of them a cop. how's that sit in your gut, utah?

it hit me!  where are they?!
james...
i know.
no reason at all, darlin'.
let's make it three thousand dollars a game, fats. c'mon, three thousand dollars. that's my bankroll, my life's savings.  what's the matter, fats? all you gotta do is beat me the first game and i'm on my way back to oakland.
i wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
hello?

been waiting long?
okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' mallory? i know she's still here, and i know you know where. so, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.

now wait a minute. what's so hopeful about your job? spending the day catching poor people stealing. you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. at least in the casino everybody gets caught. rich or poor, the odds are the same. it's all relative.
you're not a turkey. a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
and i think better than the ocean. i'm serious!

this is great, puff. you're doing fine.
a man in black.  i never saw his face.  he took me to the cell.  a blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  for days i shouted, "what have i done?  why do you do this to me?"  but no one heard, so i just stopped shouting.

aye sir, coding now.
elden, let me out of here. now! this is ridiculous, i need medical attention!

do you, mr. leland?
i've decided that if it is god, it's a sick god.  its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  it's created a situation without a goal, and i hate that.  a god whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  and us?  we would have to have "an arrangement".  an unspoken understanding that i am not human. how can i not hate something that does that?

must be painlees pole day in the shower tent.
don't worry. it's really solid this time of year.
i see you're prospering without me.
ready?
of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  no, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  and pricks.  hard, arrogant pricks --
was it a military crash?
no?
did you know she was pregnant?
hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
we spent it!
well... i have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
you can't sell this to your friends.
nice to have you back with us, mr. brubaker.
twenty-two.
thank you very much for everything.
can't hurt?  i had to get him back his job.
sal's gonna be mad.
give it to me!
yeah?
running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
madame, it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is.
it's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. big shots. fat cats. guys who can use that kind of quantity. guys who can afford two hundred thousand. basically, guys i don't know. you don't know. and, more important, they don't know you. i did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
how was school?
before we begin, i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  you could have chosen mike wallace, barbara walters, jane pauley, whatnot but you're here.
and the last one?
i think i'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
hello, goodbye, i want you, i hate you. it’s all just words. none of it means anything. what matters is what you do. you either stay put or you walk away. if you look back, you’re not walking away!
i wish you wouldn't say that....
what?  this is not possible.
are you with me... are you awake...?
you're really pushing it, bringing me here.
we're gonna change it, bugs. once we get rid of the dons, the commission's gonna rule. no more wars. no more vendettas. no more boss of all the bosses.
a beautiful geek? i don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
don't toy with floris, schwartz. why, if i were eighty years younger, i'd box your ears.
you should have let me do the talking.
a month from today?
heather, this is sara risher over at new line.  how are you?
fucking danny, man...
i don't know you.
you don't own this man!
these birds were...
132, 154.
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking.
you know how that toby is.  thinks every man he sees is after his jenny.
you can't do this.
it sounded like it came from the courtyard.
then how do you expect to write about it?
i'll get you out of there.
you're not using it today?
i don't think you have to worry much about harold. he won't do anything.
then its authority is in doubt.
he wants the money.
yes. heating and air conditioning.
they do consider this a violation of his probation. your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
i just want to go brush my teeth --
thank you.  aren't you a sweetheart?
i don't, but...
denial is not a river in egypt.
i know your parents.
may i come in?
pinot noir? how come it's white? doesn't noir mean dark?
how 'bout if i just cut off your damn water?
not if they was colored or meskin. not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
you know, eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, i'd just be lost without you.
what's that?
original.
what do you want?
what's the lighthouse?
it doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
a primate?
you can trust me.
i told you i'm not easily shocked.
how do you put up with this greek shit?
well, the widow curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  you won't have to do anything at all!  you shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
jesus.  small world.  where's the photographer?
finish the inscription, idiot!
absolutely -- sparrin' with the champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
i don't pimp that.  you talkin' about who i think you talkin' about, you mean rae. rae doole. sexy little split tail, like you say. i can't hook you up with that. i got two girls. one ain't in town, the other one pregnant. so... you on your own.
tell me more about yourself.
let me speak to ellen....
are you sure she don't know about the money?
why not buy them milk or something-- instead of dr. pepper?
in that case, here are ten basic plays. i think that's about all this bunch can handle.
uh. no it won't?
well, wait a minute, will you? i'm in conference.
you're late!
pg& -- are you sure?
try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
of course i do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
jack hasn't loved me for years. and now i'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  so cold and distant.  i've let him make her like that.
the red dragon.
i begged you to have a baby!
what we going to do?!
the bucks gonna stop right here.  if my son doesn't know the six new england states, if he has trouble with geography, i won't stick it in his face. i'll help the little guy. i'll put him in the car and take him out there. i'll take him to maine for a big lobster dinner, go skiing in vermont, hot dogs at yankee stadium...i won't stare him down.
that's i.a.'s pit bull.
the creed cat, that's right. bastard's name was "church".  let me guess. your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
... chauncey... last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
don't scream.
he --
how nice.
where?
me too. there's this poem --
you like to make the boundaries disappear.  it's not only the money, is it, george?  the adventure is part of the victory.  it's the thrill, ah?
depend on it. no s. your subject is plural.
thanks for your support, rob.  really appreciate it.
for the last time boy!!! what do those guns mean??!!
better be. you left me for him.
i am strong, paul, like a lion.
no!
what?
hard up as you are, at your age?  whadda <u>you</u> care?  surrender.
yeah.
you can't. do you know how many people i've brought into...the movement...?
you're too good to me.
five months of peace is just what i want.
you like bach?
because i can hear it.
general washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, i mean, a 'deal' with england?
what's a texas smokey doing in arkansas, man?
you see, in america they care for work, they live to work.  but in italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
you want onions?
even the fall from the plane.
show us the manager. he wears a suit.
yes, the rain has been very heavy.
i work at the big boy warehouse. in queens. i drive a fork-lift.
it looks done. i'll take it the way it is.
guess.
she has spoken to me. i heard her voice. there was no sound, but i beard it here . her voice was there in my head. i watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder i listened the clearer i heard her, as clear as i hear you, as dear as i hear my own voice.
just a second, walter. here, bruce, here's the check... and, oh, bruce, here's your wallet. i got it back.
what do you mean?
clo-clo?
what did these people do when her heart stopped?
no. i'm happy because caitlin came to see me.
never. i mean...i don't really like... singers.
yes.
vitone!  our driver has drunk too much wine.
that will soon pass. it's nothing.
how are you holding up in this weather?
blue five, break off your cover attack.  it's too late.  make your own run on the exhaust port.  do you copy, luke?
i'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
call duffy!
you didn't kick him out...? wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
who asked you?
like what?
richard ... come with me, would you ...
yup.  so i've been playing with this italian club the last three years.
you've said that already.
bernstein.
the accent! i've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. get those studs.  get those cuff-links.
here.
can all of you work?
just look at all those people.
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  one who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
i think it's be better if i was alone.
i don't get it. who are you? why have you been following me?
outta my house i want ya!!
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the grail, i'm afraid... but the knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  this tablet is one of those "markers." it proves the knight's story is true. but as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  now, the second "marker" is entombed with the knight's dead brother. our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice, italy.  as you can now see, doctor jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. we're only one step away.
i hope it ain't a lot,'cause i can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if na--
well, whoever did this is amazing.
don't be a fool. you lost your bag. the company'll make good. what's your name?
no, it hasn't.
how are the parental units functioning these days?
ah, how nice to meet you, general bonaparte.  one has read so much about you lately.  please sit down.
i suppose you want a tip?
what are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
you've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
he didn't do it!
no one else heard it?
you got types?
linnea?
as an unmuddied lake, fred. as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. you can rely on me, fred.
so i've heard.
coffee?
they killed casy first.
i had it impounded.  come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
johnny!  uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  hey, where the hell were you all day?  you gotta at least call in or something.  you okay?
you're kidding. when for?
huh! you made an error, baby.  i don't know any danielle.
nine that we know of. two didn't die.
who?
she's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. please sit down, harold. i'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
i think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  she is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
hi! i'm vanessa. you must be juno and mr. macguff. i'm vanessa.
i never forgot that.
i'm not surprised. after all that humble pie...
shall i leave?
give in to despair and all is lost.
marmite - addicted!  baths - not with other people!  islands.  your handwriting.  i could go on all day.  my husband. almásy nods.
phil.  what are you doing?
you never were...
she said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
easy, son.  you just need to get your feet back under you, that's all.  come on, boy, let's kick south.  down to the old playground.
nothing.
but of course...
i'll call you up tomorrow morning. maybe, we'll go see a movie.
bianca stratford.  sophomore. don't even think about it
so could i.
then how come you're not with him?
oh, yeah.  really nice.  who's your designer?  sassoon shark?
you think it's july of 1995?  that's the future, james.  do you think you're living in the future?
hey, is that a school?
is it fifteen minutes yet?
i thought i had to do something.
wow! they got eleanor here -- ?
can i come?
okay, we gotta get over there.  can you borrow a dress from cecile or something--
so did i.  i made it with the principal.  study hard and get a "b."  lift your dress and an "a" you'll see.
and speaking of which, you have those market share charts mr. shackley was asking about?
maybe he's wise.
your theory is interesting father but i don't think we have time to go into it right now!
you were ok for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but i think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though i told you that we had plenty at home. in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. i asked you if you knew it was a hundred. you said you did, so i let you do it. we got here, you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed.
what's wrong?
i didn't agree to three points over the vig.- what am i nuts? i didn't need it that much.
i like what you've done with the place.
who are you? tall knight we are the knights who say "ni"!
a wet!  didn't i just kill that vampire?  i think i did.  i didn't see you killing any vampires.  you were too busy playing 'beat the clock'.
i saw your face.  you knew that place. you knew those people.
no key!
i mean…your majesty, they do not, they have not, but i believe there is one who can
yes.
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. he feels no pain. he can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
but then -- i guess -- something inside me died when i realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
well, betsy mam, i drive a taxi at night.
he got it in the belly. he's still alive, but won't be for long.
sparkling apple cider?
<i>did you get all four?</i>
still nothing from the colony?
did i hear the word...
but it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, it's a goya reproduction. those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in western art.
what run him off? tell me that!
you know those shotguns i sold ya, well i need 'em back.
virge, you're makin' the arrest. you make contact, i'll back you up.  morgan'll back me up, doc'll keep an eye out for trouble.  and keep your hands on your guns. they even look like they're gonna start something, buffalo 'em. right over the head.
oh, shut up and be happy. it’s always this or that. you’re never happy, you frowny-faced grumplestilskin.
how do you know?
it is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
i've gotta...i've gotta...return some videotapes.
already gone.
and what's that?
what's that noise?
he's married...
are you sure it's all right?
they haven't been tough on me.  i just lost my money.  but when i compare these last ten years with the twenty i spent with him -
i would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
are you under the impression that now i'm in some way obligated to you?
i never wanted to be a mom.  then, sharing it with you was one thing. carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
i'm so sorry. obviously you haven't ... dr. carlson died.
say, take it easy! take it easy! listen, my boy. no use you hanging around here. just buy the tribune tonight and read all about it. you can rewrite it for your last edition.
mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the squire and the rest. they all feel colds coming on.
so why does he call himself bertrand?
you have him in restraints.
are we going to be seeing you at miss shannon's boarding school?
could be.
that explains the emptiness that haunts me.
this is not right.
so could you write down her exact address?
most of the time i slap it.
dad --
i figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  i mean she probably kidnapped herself.
you go back to that goddamn beach, i swear to god i'll make you regret it.
manolete?!
is he?
let's get a coffee.
i knowed you'd be here.  what are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
it will be a good harvest this year.
i'm looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows.
jimmy?
nice boat, taransky.
a glorified office block.  they keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
level ten.  that's where you've got to unlock arcade's heart using the keys you've found.
you damn well better start working on that impulse control.  a woman who is implicated in this case? someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
ahh. i don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
good morning, mrs. pembroke.
all night?
we'll be on the street soon, charlie - another ten minutes.
i don't want to talk about it. everything's okay now. i don't want to talk about it.
but we might just give it the 'ole college try.  what with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. but then, i'm sure the flunk-out neice of the d.a. knows all about that.
but you know my favorite name?
true... but it won't come easy or free.  if ye want to ask, ask jenny greenteeth.
it's too late... we already tested it on organa major.  it appears your data never got through.
we are clear and free to navigate.
but, daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. who's gonna help you!? who's gonna do the work, daddy?!
and you're drinking with them right now.
how are you at math?  i was hired for five hits.  i did four.
will he wish to know the details of this night?
well, i was just messing around over there, thought i'd come over and say hello to you.  i'll try anything once.  what's your name? i said mine.
like what?
it's only temporary.
what on earth are they doing?
whaddya want to know? my sign?
well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
there’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
i'm not here.  i'm still on mars.  i've come to collect you.
the five?
where's luther?
hey, honey.
it may have happened, but not the way you said.
bob.
i'll get eyescanned a dozen times before i get within ten miles of precrime.  they'll pick me up...
no talking please. i'm going to ask you some questions. please answer all questions truthfully. we'll know if you don't. birthplace ?
eh, you were miserable this morning! we got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
alright.
holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
big duke six to hell's angels four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
but it's not just those legs. it's that nose of yours i'm crazy about. that cute little button of a nose!
if they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
come one, what's wrong?
it doesn't work, it always stays black. 
well we do.  he's chummin' around with a big c named henry gondorff. ring any bells?
i know exactly what you mean.  it's just a feeling.  you know, i could go for some wine tonight.
no.
go ahead.  say it.
but don't worry, i'm clean as a whistle. i only did s & m.  no blow jobs. no screwing.
put our people on the scene.  smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
an experiment? hey, i've seen you before.
easy ted, we're not mining gold.
all of it.
get seven years, did you?
i beeped you over two hours ago.
215  continued:
of course, of course. how can we be of service?
i was gonna split it with you guys.
what? i was at sandy's i just lost track of time.
i gather you're a decorator.
yes.
--they're all the same, all those ivy league places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
shut up, would you! how can i concentrate?!
move a finger, harcourt, and you're history...
margo, really...
is she running a temperature? what is it?
remember when mommy and daddy got divorced?
i didn't have a chance to wrap it.
these are great.
expert! going to write a book on it. called the "hitch-hikers hail."
i'm going home.
he cut her up and dressed the wounds.
you've said a lot of things about the president in the last few months.
daddy...
and you think we got a chance to find her?
you ordering chop suey again?
well, we ain't never had one of them. where'd you think that was gonna get you?
would you like some coffee?
sounds like a train.  looks like a train.
i need to confess again.
a lot of people don't.
half to the delgado family and half to clo-clo's family.
i don't want her to go, lillian.
the character that's supposed to be me, susan alexander--
what are you looking for?
hi, dad.  dad, this is jessica.
no.  what you do today?
big sonuvabuck. based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... i'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
he's gotta be a nut!  he saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
no, you didn't. what branch?
it's about me and david.
mom, do you miss dad?
what?  you and madox?  or you and katharine clifton?
you did?
ho - ly - shit.
good.
no, thank you. i'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
i don't know.  fly casual.
from his landlord -- once a month.
they called, they're going to settle, what i want to do is build up as much ...
look: i have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, i'm trying to make some sense...
no.
not a real fan of halloween humor, will.
no problem.  we're in.
what?
college president shouldn't drink. tends to set a bad example, i figure i saved them from a big temptation.
in a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... why does he set this line apart?
the heels on these shoes are very large.  why have i never noticed this? the heels on these shoes are grotesque.
but you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
but how do i know...?
you won.
all right, what about it? we get out a paper just the same. did you ever stop to think of that?
gerry says the meeting went well.
-- no, that's okay. it's just sean...
ucla? my cardigan sweater period.
i want to rent a movie.
thank you...
a for effort, nick, honestly, a for effort and an honorary degree. i'm surprised you never escaped from the mountain.
therapy? hell no, i just don't want to do it alone.
just make sure you're not caught. if you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. if you find nothing -- he's clear.
why did you come back?
you should've done all this before.
were you with him last night?
ask yourself, why do you seek the cup of christ? is it for his glory, or for yours?
you, you don't under...
i told her that i have no idea what adam was talking about in that letter.
what's he doing here?
you got a lot of guts calling me.
torch it over there!
then he dies. right now.
-- gee...
but you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
oh...?
i smell it.  it's here.
somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for information, so on.
you think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  i'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the gamin' control board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like nicky santoro?
[beat] yeah, i'm fine.
how long 'till we can eject?
you said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
you know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
i... i'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
listen, you're right.  don't do it. i'll just... send you an address, okay?
this is california, anything is possible.
yes.
rambo and brewer were selected as write-offs.
get away, snorri.
perhaps you could remind me.
sort of -- mathew hooper is aboard the research vessel aurora, presently in the antarctic ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
it's alright, thank you.
we needed to know all we could.
no, we checked his story with a tipster.  he was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
hi, marty!
i was twelve.  nix took me hostage, to get swann to come to him.
we retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
what do you want me to do? our people need me.
script coverage?
this is miss costello...?
and where did you say you were from?
i thought you didn't.
he can't, samantha. he's been suspended from after-school activities. donnie... are you still with us?  how was your therapy session tonight?
hey, look, i'm wilma flintstone.
oh, god, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
when?  after you get all drunk and loaded?
so when i left, she gave me these books.
uh, what are those boxes?
that's not necessary.  you're in.
you're the advisor.  you should stop her.  she's not qualified.  she's just a sophomore.
66.
too far?
that scum joseph reed... they're calling him the 'king of pennsylvania'.  the man's a budding cromwell.  he condemns rich tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. naturally, the pig hates me for every tory i've saved.
what the hell are you doing?
i fear i'll never see you again.
you get hardy.
save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
you brought us here. and that morning i found you in the barn. you had scratches on your face --
so far so good.
what a dork. huh huh.
wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
down- i'm-i'm goin' uptown.
i gotta believe. out!  now they're rollin'.  king-five-four gets an eight.  pair'a nines with a jack gets a four. ninas still up.
he told me there could be only one.
so it's true, then?
i don't like anything else.
hold her steady into the wind. southwest by west.
thank you for coming.  i'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
what did they give you?
thanks.
why aren't you there?
i owe you a very serious apology, young man.  it wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  i sincerely hope that you do not.
thank you so much.
how could you possibly?
immortality.
what the hell are you asking me for? tag it. move it.
no it's not!
you need to control yourself and think before you --
did you have trouble performing? yeah, that's...
yes, i don't know what to make of it.
are you sure?
no. no, just let me think for a minute.
why do you cry?
terrific.  a real pillar of the community.  was hubley missing anything when they found him?  was he ripped off?
that was the idea.
hmm?
it's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. no advantage there, kid.
i'm already familiar with taylor's opinion.
about what?
i want you to give up that terrible job.
get up on the bar and show me how you work.  if i like it you don't have to go in.
what do <u>you</u> call it?  ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  i should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
a group of us are going out tonight.
i love you, chuck.
look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
added to which indignity, i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner. some quarterback punk, johnny unitas or something.
i rent them. monthly lease, with an option to buy.
where is the austrian?

"midnight mahogany"? 'cuz i'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like ronald reagan here.
why do you even want it? it would look stupid on you.
passport, please.
maybe i'll do that.
i'm sorry. don't hate me.
let's go.  everybody take off?
nice piece of work, fox. why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
well, we'll have to take what's here. a bird in hand is worth two in jail.
i'll see you.
well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
when?
not like matt, you mean.
no you can't lose the shot.  the meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
how?
length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
i'm sorry to bother you, i know you're real busy right now, but how many times, max?  how many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? you could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
i wouldn't worry too much about it, stew. she'll see it your way.
you didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
but --
come on, eve. let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
yup.
i'm sure i'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
we're going to war, aren't we.  if they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
look, old man, you stay out of this. we spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. and then you think you can -
nope.
who is they, who is they?
okay.
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
what did you get?
uh huh...
he is at a fragile point. he's got problems--
is there a problem here?
i wouldn't think so.
i just thought i'd surprise you.  what's the matter?
i'm not sure you answered my question.
why? why does everybody conk?
yes.  hic!
yeah.
the university computer is down for maintenance, but i've been going through my own notes...
you've been waiting your chance. you're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
i guess i'm a little screwy.  maybe i could believe it.  should i try?
pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
it does. feels right.
i imagine you would've though.
"love your enemies"...
...no...no goddamn use.  i have a son, y'know?
impact in fifteen seconds!
them?
yes, you are. you're very sick.
escort everyone's favorite she-male over here nice and peaceful-like. let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  i'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
after i graduated, i called him long distance and asked, "now what?"  he said, "get a job."  when i turned twenty-five, i called him and asked, "now what?"  he said, "i don't know. get married."
elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
it's his heartbeat.

pleasure.

mississippi's the other way!
fuck it's over.  that money's mine.

but stoltzfus said...
but you're beautiful... your skin glows.
you don't like him, do you?
lucky? you call that lucky?
i will go with you.
yes. from the highest authority. there are two conditions. the u.n. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
that's right.  and we nailed over a thousand of them.  we did it by crunching data.  good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  nobody had to tackle a car once.  you getting the signal, special agent?
well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
what'd you say they call these spaceships?
guess there will, if it says so.
fuck you - fuck you.
i got clawsen on hold--
now, who are all these people?
god, he hardly even talks anymore.
i'm in pain.
dennis! there's some lovely filth down here ...  oh! how d'you do?
what is that?  a handkerchief?
there's another one we owe 'em.
is that why there are more men on the walls?
atley jackson came to see me ...
let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
kate’s on two, jack.  nice ride...
three.  and add some basil.
so how long is this trip?
no -- it feels wonderful.  i've held that axe up for ages.  oh ---
gordon liddy, you mean?
she's murdered her hair... you do something with her, i'm never going to touch her again.
circuits are overloaded.
oh.
this is a lot of money.
yes, ann?
what is it, gilbert? tell mother! what did he say?
a drill, what are you up to?
stop looking at me like that! i'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  and my life is not a cosmic whim!  i am in charge of my life -  - and i want to stay.  everything that was taken from me is here, michael. all these years, she was there without me.  helpless. i should have been here.
the whole city has stopped. people are running around like ants!
why do you look at me like that?
you don't know?
every geek here's got a thing for lisa. but that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
i'm your program?
we're gay lovers, what's it to you?
chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
you'll find out when i get you home. thanks, sam.
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
...the digital conveyor.
you didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
"los angeles, upi: elijah muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the black muslim movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. that should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
that's strange. i'm nervous. donny's nervous. everyone's nervous. but not you...
uh, yeah, being concert master of the philadelphia symphony orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
think eddie had something to do with it?
i made you these for the trip. they're marshmallow rice squares.
aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
uncommon, too.
who's your candidate?
but -- why?
home, sweet home.
i know. i know. he didn't go.
i can't see it.
i got here as fast as i could. where's cathy?
you guys are real... aren't you?
thank you, melvin. you overwhelm me.
i'm going to disappear. i die in a car crash in taiwan. very easy to do.
not yet.  but we'll find him.
for fuck's sake, abbe! what am i to do? police my readers as you police me? suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? would you condemn the bible? i think not!
well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. unfortunately, i have to keep certain parts of my life private.
i'll be damned.
i call it like i see it, and what i see is definitely soft.
i'm going to need an operation. maybe a couple of them. they have to wait for it it to heal first. then they break it again.
you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
what sins have you to confess?
negative.  negative.
put it back in park, blade.
so, if christ won, that means, what does that mean, father?  that satan...
ricky?  where...what...
yeah.  and you used that. used <u>me</u>
what, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
it is, it is! hie hence, be gone, away.  o, now be gone. more light and light it grows.
ah!  this is very exciting.
c'mon girl. eat up.
what is its antidote?
so. is it true that gene simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? y'know, to make it so long?
we surprised a band of smugglers.
so maybe we got enough for one ticket. fuck!
not if i give you all the cards ...
okay. here's the deal and it's a good one. lois is cool. it's a pacified situation.
be friends?
sonuvabuck! what's with you, man? who are you?
why, certainly. with your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
me. my home number is on this card.
i mean, would you care to join me.
do you want to hear it or not?
it's not my style, okay?
this thing you got... i've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. i can see that.  but that nigger tehronne. thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. i mean, i can see a tree. but that piece of shit?
we're on the verge of a mutiny, colon!
macready!
no, she's getting married.
come on, dad. come on!
you said anything, dil
ehh...okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
man we fucked him up.
i've come to take you back to the land of the living.
professor. well, not exactly, professor. you see, we don't point it at the sun.
would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
describing you. a square from out there. i mean you're nowhere.  miss four corners.
samuel says you killed a lion.
just drop me off here.
what were you doing?
the realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  the house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the london flat.
i got him on the knee!
well that's that, then. i mean, i was worried about mug shot possibilities already. but now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. they ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. that's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
what's this?
let's say a 10% finder's fee?
look, i'm warning you.  you do anything, i'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
are you proud of me, bill?
say hi to rob and carrie. have some fun!
well, okay. but we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. now the first thing i want is an exact copy of the john doe letter in your own handwriting.
what are you going to be when you grow up, todd?
come on then.
you must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
you're not supposed to...
does she go up to the farren's often?
who told you to do that?
all right, daniel. jump in.
it appears well.  it has already clotted.
hey, tabloids paid ted bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  and how much you think monica got for writing book about the president coming on to her?  it pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. look, you want magazine or not?
they only arrested that poor soul because he's japanese.
the passionate one?
bob and rick are in denver.  i gotta get up there as fast as possible.  frank, get me a load of flares.
the klingon, the romulan, the federation consuls. now i know enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
listen, dear. now tell me the truth about this. were you in cluett's apartment?
no use thinking these things now.
you know why the grateful dead are always on tour?
sir.  i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
yeah, i guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
claire.  pleased to meet you.
alice, you think you can leave?
do not swear at all; or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, which is the god of my idolatry, and i'll believe thee.
why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
compensation for my brother-in-law's car. indy, your father and brody --
the way you talk.  never heard a woman talk like that.
jail?
i'm gonna roll him off the hood. always lift with your legs...
good work, my brothers. fan-fuckin'- tastic! i think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. lose the rest. and cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. cut it after i ask, 'i take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' don't even let him answer. fuck him. then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in dr. reinghold laughing.
you're willing to die for this.
speak to this lad, al, ... to mr. falco.
you said -
huh?  oh.  yeah.  tape deck.  couple of creedence tapes.  and there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
couple hours.  let me buy you a coffee.
have you met mr lyle?  he's in sugar...?
that's not enough.
you'd lose the money-shots.  no.  i'll catch a bus.  or a cab.  don't worry about it.  go.
that's not him... jesus, stop freaking me out.
you don't.  you just learn to live with it.
he wants to kill us!
oh, man --
you know what's nice about you? you just seem happy being yourself. you don't try to act cool.
so whatta' you going to do in san francisco?
it's going to be done exactly the way i've told mr. thatcher -
just a minute -- just a minute -- i have nothing against the idea but i still say let's go back to the hotel terminus. moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
it's no joke.  i'm responsible for what happens, you know.  embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  i have to put down a deposit for the room.  i have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
the hell you talking about? what train?
let me repeat -- why not?
you know, we're okay. they're not finding us. you'll remember me in the morning. and you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
stand right here.
it's all right...charlie, let's move outside.
what do you mean?
their next target.  the name is neo.
do you know where fuse box is?
where's doug?
i take it this file is still open.
my stanzi - look at her! isn't she beautiful? come on now, confess, papa. could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
at what time will you be available?
it's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
take a look at this.
that's just what i'm sick of. everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! greedy for what you got. a bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
i don’t know.
[the girl's. pinta's.]
i bullshitted him.
i suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
well, it was nice meeting you, again.
cancer in a box.
being in the club means being stirred up by things.  you look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
what are you talking about? danny slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  i played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  and hank says danny's moved to new york.  to better himself.
i'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
what are you doing?
you already have the tent?
are you talking about jamie lloyd?
all right, i'll work on it, i'll, do some research. but in the meantime, don't get crazy.
this is one of my dreams, jake. ever since i was a little girl. i never thought it would happen.
pull over! now!
nothing.
what?
i don't know what it's called.
fucking hell.
yeah, and that's all i'm going to say. if you want to arrest me, go ahead...
that mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
you don't think so, huh?
early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
what do you think you're doin'?!
maybe it's being polished or something. maybe they're cleaning it.
how come you were in my truck?
c'mon seymour, i'm trying to collect data here! don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
what about rehearsal?
you investigating those murders out at the lake?
yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
how do you keep the water temperature stable?
what word?
. peggy sue, i love you, and i need you peggy sue...
i understand.
should we burn him? bury him? what would he have liked, louis?
francesca?
fuck calling her. i'm going down there.
i am making out the report now. we haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
you are quite sure it's secure?
lemon doesn't go in gin and tonics, darlin'.  where ya' from?
you designed it?
where do we go now?
are you alright?
huh?
we were good when you bailed, weren't we?
we almost slept together... and... then the hair started and i booked.
dead, mrs. lampert -- like last week's news -- like charles, mrs. lampert --
yes, but...
mr gammell?
can you tell me whose...
spaceship.
then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. that's when i hopped the train to come back here, because i knew you'd be a wreck.
i've been around here six months and i still can't get over it.
not a prayer.
the whole time? eighteen years?
we'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
and?
no, i...
no, no i don't. are you sure?
i'm just calming the kiddies.  there's no need to worry about santa. he's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice jewish friend, the hebrew hammer.
no no, i know --
don't hold it against him. he just never got caitlin out of his system. it's not your fault. it's dante.  i don't know thing one about chicks. do you want to cry or something? i can leave.
what is it?
i know. i kept walkin', i headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. you let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. you kept askin', 'why'd you come to see me now? why now?' like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
he had a girlfriend?
oh, wait, maude. look!
you don't have fifty foot of apartment!
but i could talk to the limo guys. tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. make the point in a way they'd understand it.
ray's special recipe. he always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
will she pick me up after school?
is that right?
no, i don't remember anything. it looks like i... but... i don't remember.
i've read official estimates but i wouldn't bet my house on them.  i've heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers.  at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
no.  i don't think so.
excuse me, "sir".  i thought we spoke as equals.
gee, i don't know. i guess i'm not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
an... entertainer?
oh, you were in the band?
what about the uranium?
sure. but ya got a deck a cards? i wanna play some klob.
did it hurt a lot?
miss mollie malloy. she's a wonderful person.
i think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  how does it feel to be dead?
kind or not kind. what's the difference? it always ends up the same way.
something like that.  the odds catch up with you.  the odds are like gravity.  you can't negotiate with them.  so...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
aren't you ever going to get married?
---and a snake-eye glare, arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had.
we're getting out of this place. we've done enough.
scotch and plain water, i think.
i say we make him pay first. after that you can do whatever you want to him.
great. is that what you're going to say when i put you on the stand?
hello, miss kubelik.
it's okay.
wow.
oh, paul, can i read each chapter when you finish? i can fill in the "n"s.  will she be her old self, now that ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
man, this guy is really good.
nothing's happening.
she's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>is</u> she?
how do you know he'd buy them?
yeah...?
that obvious, huh?
my secret?
nobody tells me to fire anyone. i told them: shove it up the big one.  sorry.  i said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
after the jack-o-lantern.
she has the face of an angel... she was an angel. she was so kind... so kind to me. it's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. i'm sure i must have been a great disappointment to her.
my assistants.  i should have known. nothing is given to me.  i have to acquire everything.
-- there's not much room --
you never have dessert.
i really don't think that's necessary treves. i'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
but... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
what's that!? wha'cha say? huh?
did you pay the guy the reward?
why certainly!
hello.
what do you drink?
when i walked out, i waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  ten. waiting for you to come find me.
swat is a lifesaving unit, you know.
hey!
he's gone, too.
i'm in from new york.  i came to see swann.
since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
good morning, mr. killaine. i'm sorry i can't give you the name of my bank--because i have no bank at the moment.  that was a crude trick.
he ask you out for next weekend?
which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
i understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the metropolitan and sat there listening to la traviata, all by himself.  he was afraid of catching cold.
that's just how my brain works, i guess.
so you're only invisible... to yourself?
are you crazy!
yeah.  but that's what i wanted to talk to you about.
it's not in me.
it's always some kind of an excuse. it's- you know, you used to think that i was very sexy. what... when we first started going out, we had sex constantly... we're-we're probably listed in the guinness book of world records.
uh, scooby, now i understand how you want to be a tv talk-show host and all, like conan o'brien, but did you know even he went to college?
mr. gower . . . mr. gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. it's just exactly what i wanted.
no!
you ballin' her?
the boys had 'em. i know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
now--turn around, if you would.
frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. do you know about that?
what's okay?
that's right. you didn't.
is that bad?
... fix themselves.
senator paine will state it!
sir, i recommend we raise shields.
the right man? talk to me, ray.
then one day she meets a john holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. this mother fucker's like charles bronson in "the great escape." he's diggin' tunnels. now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. pain.
you could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
so if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  stay in the guest house.  skip the graduation parties.  you'll never see duquette.  okay?  i love you.
so, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
yeah.
as for example, what?
i hope you know what....
i wish you would.
book five, deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "but this shall you deal with them.  you shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
damn, life is strange. i had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- not that i didn't admire you for it.
range: 3000 kellicams.
it's still pretty hairy, sir.
well... to be honest... i'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when i get nervous i'm not myself and i'm afraid i'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure.
looks like you live in here, for chrissake!
get out of there!
--for the first time i'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- woodward, i got a tip. a guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named donald segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. the fbi knows about segretti-- howard hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. but segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the republicans knew what he was doing.
please.  i won't hang on you.  as soon as we get there you can dump me.  i don't care.  i just want to get out of here.
i guess we're not leaving, right?
i lost.
you can't just... kill him.
actually, it is a shotgun.  hold onto it--
rod, i say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
it’s called character. god, you’re predictable.
are you at peace with your family?
are you okay?
you ratted on my mother??
no.  not mean.  just...very angry.
where are you goin'?  did you tell him?
that's a strange angle.
a little mixup in signals. let's go.
you remember willy cicci, don't you, freddie?  we was all together with the old man clemenza in brooklyn... before...uh...
he's not any kind of program, sark. he's a user.
they can be saddled.
come here. feel this.
it doesn't!
the timing -- yes.  he says it's up to joe.
that was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
how long?
hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
it's gonna be great.  'caring about his wife.'  'spending time on her favorite issue...'
oh. well, maybe i'm uncomfortable with my appearance. i feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
we're excited.
he'll give us a sworn statement.
oh, do you like it?  i'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
i say, this is all terribly formal. must i go an calling you dr. peel?
i'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. if that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off i'll live with, ed.
goddamn it, i ask you a question, you better answer it, or i'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
wait a minute. wait a minute.  matt, do you realize you're up against something? you're being charged with murder. it's serious, son. now come on, i know you didn't do it.  but we've got to make them believe it. come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
claude. here's to your new job down at the bank. i always knew you'd make something of yourself.
the police don't know that.  and it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  i'll take you as far as california.  if we can even make that.  after that i'm cutting you loose.
apparently.
no. i don't mean that. i just meant in general.
why won't you come with me? what are you so scared of?
and you have no idea where he lives?
as usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  except  it wasn't local democratic headquarters, it was national democratic headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
and you ...?
i can't dance fast.
it didn't hurt too much, did it?
thank you.
right.
be careful....
it's all over between us, doug, i'm sorry, but that's the truth.  i've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  i'm sorry.  it isn't <u>you</u>, j...
she works part-time at my dad's store.
how's that?
heck, yah. ya think, is dave open yet?
correct me if i'm wrong.  i thought we were on the same side.  what the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
i hope you enjoyed your visit.
i realize you must have gone through hell--
where's my wife?
after this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and i are going away.  just the two of us.  no dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. just you and me.
ever seen anything like that before?
an unholy trinity ...
i'll tell you why. you remember we talked about you playing for hitler's birthday?  and you told me that goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
it's your father. hank. your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
i don’t care if you’re tim allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
oh yes, of course.
my god, rose, what's gotten into --
how're you holding up?
who you saving the dishes for?
i'm totally blown away. you're getting married. it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex.
i made an appointment with father phillip mcnulty at st. bernard's. we're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
got any good ideas?
okay!  how do we turn this thing on?
you take your money, too seriously, bo.
baby, i think about you a lot. i'm really sorry about everything. you have to believe me. i'm serious. i wish, y'know, that we were –
i think what you did was...
thank you very much.
i'll be gone two or three weeks.
...that's all well and good, captain, save for one thing:  there's no gold down there.
never.
not my girl anymore
goddamn gastro's killing me.  making me blind. hey billy!
milo?
you gonna do what i say, got it?
yah, no, i'm kinda - i'm kinda busy -
what scheme?
maybe he's just - waiting...
actually, i've come with good news; the corleone family has done you a favor.
well, if it isn't the little frenchman!  how is the little frenchman?
personally, i think it's god.  at least, it fits my definition.
and here i am...
insane ... ?
christ... i can't believe it... invisible ink?
you are no good to me -- in jail.
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. i got flagged for my blood pressure pills. the only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? well, the faa is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. i kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in cincinnati. and i was right.
but she's not the enterprise.
yes.  dr. h. delbruck.
he might be ready to chop us up.
what's it to you?
you do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. the directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
operator.
a man should be upright, not be kept upright.  history shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  i want you to consider becoming my heir.
you wrote it, didn't you?
oh, it's too good.  we got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
he's not fine.
oh, jesus, panes.  i can't, i can't believe that bitch is in my house.
selina, did you make it home, all right?  i tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the hut." whatever that means..
with some on the planet...
mmm...
i'm afraid.
i wouldn't mind a little night life. how about you?
mr. arkady, honest, i ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. so now i don't have a cent to my name. i can't even get my car out of the garage.  i tell you, mister...  if it weren't for bad luck i wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   so, i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car out of this garage, see?  the bus depot here has a western union thing.  and of course i'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
thanks.    where've you been all day?
they want to settle.    it means a lot of money.
the boat blew.  there was a leak in the gas line.  there were two previous repairs.  there was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  a real heavy investigation.  zilch. goose-egg.  it was an accident.
no... we don't...
there was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. they were both masters.
you don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
yes.
we're moving through time.
i sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight mary sue.
what good'll it do?
no.
yes.
well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
do we have characters?  how about honeycutt, snowflake, rastus, nigger, jim, sambo, jungle bunny, and how could we forget aunt jemima.
fuzzy face is gone.
anybody see anything?
i don't know. for your hair. for your beautiful dress. for... you know, i feel like a man again. you know i love the opera. you know it's been a long time since i've been to the opera.
they're dumb things. i got tired of them.
yeah?
did you know mr. lime well?
jesus, what do you think this is -- wheel of fortune?  let me spell it out for you.  you have to hide like you don't even exist.  you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
you want to go?
that's all you cared about.  i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two.
three times, then two times.
i'm not losing it again!
i'm afraid the rest of ward's island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, the charnier shipping company, of marseilles, france.
it's your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons.
what's the terrain down there?
that's the punchline, y'ready?
you always hurt the ones you love.
it wasn't a joke.
please!
i doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. i could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland.
let him finish.
we want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
no.  but, honest.  what are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  i don't even know what they mean -- "beat them off with a stick."
on my honor as your daddy...
oh, christ.
the woman you're stuck on.
your brother, huh?
you took it!  all of it!  and what if i need it?
you said you couldn't kill anybody.
the front gate would be best, general.
i...
you mean to tell me that you invited this mr. fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
don't forget about production for use.
that's enough.
departure angle on viewer.
what?
look, stop treating me like a child. i'm not stupid.  i know there's a problem.
oh yeah?
why don't you help me?
there wasn't anything like that. the police and the fbi people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  my husband... his heart broke when mary left...
i don't know. i'm still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husband's dog.
i can't regotiate.
where are you, walker?
well, of course not.  my goodness, what a fuss you're making.  well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
you want me to stay?
sir, we stay with the president.
he'd act normally when he was with other people. it would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
i changed it.  it used to be sugar kowalczyk.
how the fuck they know that?
ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  not even a detail?   you must try.
i've got it.  he bends down and bites the back of her neck.
in that case, fine.  want to see my magic trick?
she is not your birth mother, is she?
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin'. how far did you want to go?
how'd you have the manpower to--
you broke my heart.
you believe this, don't you? that you're a vampire? you really think...
shit. it's neil prescott's car.
of course you shouldn't. you don't know how to do it. dunking's an art. don't let it soak so long. a dip and plop, into your mouth. if you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. it's all a matter of timing. i ought to write a book about it.
i have no luggage.
of course not!
may i have a drink?
oh, it's fine.  fine.  good.  good. bye.  bye.
does it tell me how to get laid?
yeah. yeah. well, anyway, we've got "saunders" settled. maybe that was my trouble all along.  yes, *sir*. i'm all ready to go now--  what's your *first* name?
planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
mrs. ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
i'll see you then...i look forward to it.
one fuckin' year ago i had ta hit you up for train fare. now i can buy the fuckin' train. and i ain't even a fuckin' sicilian!
it's all right.  it's organic.
you're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
holy...
that's why i asked you...
try harder.
hello jack.  you don’t have to stop singing on my account...
honda 250, huh?
that's always your privilege, sir.
no.
no. i was just curious if what i heard about you is true ?
you know something? i’ve just seen so much ugliness i don’t think i’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  i’d hoped to have a private word with adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
a friend?
sure. i can follow that.
who's your boyfriend?
mr. kross, i'm not here to sell you my stock.  on the contrary, i'm here to buy yours.
yes.  in the church at domremy.
you know, a mookalone, a schlep.
how you doing, chewbacca?  still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
i warned you civil defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
you said i could be vice-president, cuervo. your right-hand man.
come now, mr. jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
we don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. why would the germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? i mean it <u>was</u> world war two, not a school play.
don't hit the face! not the face!!
choose your targets men. that's right watch those markers. 55
meningitis?  what the hell is meningitis?
steak's really good tonight. scooby  good.
blast door. it's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
no...black creek.  yes.  in florida?
you wanna go home?
so go.
hold this.
all men love. but men like hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
i want to see brad.
i think we're lost.
i'd go fifty-fifty with you .
your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the show they woulda ripped you.
i'm sorry, mr. dean. but larry's in st. lukes now, so i'm a little--i'm not myself. the union bosses say unless we take bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
five o'clock.  killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy kraut.
you're making it up pretty good so far.
myself and mr. pink?
sorry about frida. she's been friends with jen forever.
are you going to ride that wave?
not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia.
you look like you're far away. far away and thinking about other things. i'm right about that, aren't i?
and you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
hello.
31 people.
your resume is impressive. nine years in the army. extensive counter terrorism work. i shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. what's the catch?
we can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
in an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
you have somebody else out there?
we get the games on the radio sometimes.
well...
this is garbage!
how are you, kelly? would you like to take a break for a minute?
that's right. that one.
in a fire? never.  look, i'm his brother. i care about him, y'know? he was going to get himself killed. maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. and i couldn't -- i just couldn't...
she's my daughter, tom.
it's a ...baby.
jabez ...
i'll take the .45 and the webley .32.
oh, poor baby. well you can relax. i have a mission for you.
but playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. they cannot make it true.
you should come back with me to steven's house.
hell yeah. you work here long?
nobody's going to rush me into anything!  you keep away from me! 
professor tripp.
do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
you need to go.
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
so do i!
why would we --
it's on the table where i left it! what the hell are you doing?! hurry up!
what in the goddamn hell are you doin'? it's the middle of the night.
you don't have to.
then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
roy.
yes. but we can't.
i can't swim! i can't swim!
yo. "billy bob". was i two beats behind, or what?
he's right on the heading.
no thanks?
we don't have the manpower.
what's...
where am i -- exactly, sir?
do you know what his budget was?
i thought you blew all your money.
i got my sources.
who the fuck is arthur digby sellers?
a gun?  why -- to shoot, of course.
eighth room down, babe...
thank you, basil.
yeah... we're gonna scare him.
no, i transferred into monmouth this year. i was tired of missing him. 
yeah?
oh, sure. now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
oh, baby, i'm so sor...
huh?
a fine choice, sir.
no, no, no!  i disagree with you completely! i tried it once--
i'm a good mother!
i think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. this is a news organization. people are always telling us things they shouldn't. we have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... and if it is, we air it.
what the hell -- what is this!? people died. agent carruthers is dead!
now we donít have to eliminate him?  you like that, donít you claire?  donít you?
swim.
where's the power and radio setup?
o'clock?
but i loved the second one she wore. and this one --  -- is beautiful.
was the child full term?
excuse me... i should apologize.  i, um... i... have no great love of...
were you with another man?
well, i believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
in your pocket, please...
if you actually have news from manchester then...
did you put like a hundred things of tic tacs in my mailbox?
i'm going to. it's my second chance.
mr. manager.
i love all of them. they're strong, gentle men with families of their own. and if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
i know...i know you're the strongest cop in town.
yeah... like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
i see. i'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
shwoof, that makes me feel better. i can't believe this is the iron curtain.  all the guy at airport customs wanted to know was "who shot j.r.?"
do you want me to stop?
this looks ancient.
i can't give you that.  this guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  he's been getting it from every end.  i'd love to hear his story.
yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
oh, sure, sure. but first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in reno -- meanwhile, i'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
good way to get your head blown off.
what about your family, donnie?
... not what i expected when we walked through that door.
why's that?
thank you.
oh, my god.
hello. gerald lambeau, m.i.t.
did you ever got ahold of maya yesterday?
could you not take some occasion without giving?
objection, asking the witness to speculate.
oh no.
"the voiiiiices made him do it."
yeah.
yes, although, i really..... thank you.  yes, it's great to have him with us. the whole family's very excited.
get him!
cut it out, will you? just cut it out and come back here.
sir, you can't just--
maybe.  and maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this i'll put him behind bars myself!
why not?  they seem friendly enough.
huh... i suppose the idea of a one day trip to los angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
i ought to break your damn neck.
all right ... i got some hungry people in there ... i want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
i can see that. the man's car you stole. raphael ruiz. he's head of the 19th street gang and one crazy motherfucker. and frankie zammito's got the word out he's looking for some french dudes. you're french ain't ya?
i already did that.
what?!  that's insane!!!  why would i go to the police?
do you want me to be there?
they're the worst. college girls are one step from the streets. they smoke like men inna saloon. my son joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. one step from the streets, i tell you. mrs. pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
we know all that, exposition.
i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you. i seen you over there follerin' me.
attrition.  when you regret your sins, but not because you love god.
oh, ok.   maybe.
before you start picking your nose, i know he put you up to it.
why are you so cold to her and carlo?  they live with us on the mall now, but you never get close to them.
todd, what's the matter?
if you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
hi. you didn't answer your beeper.
well, maybe i wouldn't lie...but i could tell the story the way i did just now, so that people could understand that john is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  you won't get a cent.
doubt it.  he's dead.  the look out's a cemetery.
superman broke your monster, uncle lex.
ray, run faster.
give the guy air. everyone to a neutral corner.
are you staying at the hotel?
...well, then, i guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
so what's unique?
what plane.
so they know everything.
well, you sure do a good imitation.
benjamin -- this is my mother!
i was upstairs with eddie --
he looks like he was designed by scientists. for desert warfare.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. and i am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
what d'you got?
i have to think about my future. and what people expect from me.
i ... it was terrible, i leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
we got him!  dad you got him!
don't worry about it, boss.
no, she could get hurt.  if you believe what's happening to these other people.
professor brown! it's almost eight thirty -- i'm outta here!
i don't know.
what?
seven and nine!
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. agent scully doesn't deserve this.
impressive. this is bigger than our whole house.
i'll call you.
the hockey player? he a friend of yours?
what do the years matter?  i've known you for centuries...
yeah?
anything you say, mammacitta.
there's a rumour... i don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der null.
this is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, matthew. the red sox win a world series. this is deeply, intensely personal. all the mistakes i've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. and your grandmother knows why.
i... i know that, john...
huh. that explains all the tannins. and how long in oak?
what do you do, tyler?
a man would look anywhere for her, mary. there is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
outside hacker?  what the fuck are you talking about?
good school. what year?
i'm not afraid of the fire anymore. it will purify me...
adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
sir?
<u>and</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
that's my father. i got to run.
if all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  rae. rae! i'm not fightin' with ya. i just know you got more in you than junk.  now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  you know how to boil water?
why are they ganging up against me?
we were afraid.  silence seemed better.  to come forward seemed like a mistake.
goin' where?
foredecks. crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area. can we move in closer?
sounds like my husband.  he never came back either.  at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break.
yes.
what do i love?  i love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! the gardens at our house in freshwater - all my secret paths.
so where is young jonah?
what does this mean to you?
even if money wasn't an issue, dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
well, what does it have to do with? us?
hey! what are you trying to pull!
no. actually i think it's fucking crazy, i don't know if i could do it.
so whenever we want...
hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
and what will i live on? my oil wells in texas?
i'm sorry.
the usual.  heredity and environment.  what's the deal with doc ock?
captain miller, you copy?
it's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
we've got it up here!  it's trapped! get up here fast!
thank you, exposition.
what is the matter?
onions?
do machines ever play?
well, i was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
i got what i fucking deserved.  i had it all.  i could've kept going!
sweet! oh, that is sweet!
where's leo devoe? where's chili palmer? where's my fuckin' money?
i love you.  i always will.
i - i would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? you wouldn't like it if i did it to you.
hey, zimm doesn't ask for dick. zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
i think he wanted you to tip him.
by "they" you mean the white house, don't you?  your buddy from usc, dwight chapin-- he works for the white house.
beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
...maybe i should just move in here with you... i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job.
yeah, heh heh. i think i just had an accident. heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. i--i started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--i--i just naturally got aboard--

well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
yes yes, i did get my degree up there.
less ten percent.
put more into it!
i'm not that sick.
my boss.
i'm sorry, ma. but--i didn't know what i was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. i didn't even know i was gonna do it.

because of what i'm betting.  my life.
i've been thinking...  carla, would you do one favor for me?
oh god, if only i'd known.
what?

they need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
well he asked me for it!
i'm thinking.  do i know you well enough to really chew you out?
the corporate plundering of yeshoto industries... at first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
how? did they figure it out after i died?
the glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
'practice and methodology in anaesthesia.' general textbook on the subject. is that correct?
come on, let's go.
i'm trying to help.
you look like brothers.
you're not helping my heart condition any, barnes!  now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
good way to lose your job.
hey, carl, what's wrong ?
no, you're not.  you're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
damn.  damn!  if i could just get chris to read this poem!
... babies.
what would you say to a short one? bourbon still your drink?
it's like smoking without inhaling.

"ay me, sad hours seem long. was that my father that went hence so fast?"

i thought you were going to go away. aren't the police after you?
it was the poorest lemon ranch in california, i can tell you that.  my father sold it before they found oil on it.
mike, you sure about moe selling. he never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
jesus christ, jerry.
i thought i was allowed to defend myself.
it's classified.
where's those glossy prints you promised?  tonight's the latest i can place them -
won't keep you a moment, sir.
i'll call him now.
of course.
because he believed me.
it's a lousy fifteen kilos.  i piss fifteen kilos.
hildy!
i haven't seen her in almost two years.
read some good books.
is it the money thing?
i bet you have loyal customers.
whad'ya talkin  about ?
when?
cameron.
and what about daniel webster?
jd.
i don't have to listen to you!  you're not my mother.
please.
well, you did!  chet found out and he's nuts.  it took everything i could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. you have to stop this stuff, knox.
you think it's funny, huh?
annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
you're a clergyman.
could we sail to venice?
i'm not even going to dignify that --
i don't understand.  not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
look, i just want to pick up my car.
who's left out there?
she said she's got to be home by nine.
look out!  jupiter and saturn'll get you every fucking time.
he's my father.
you what? to save me?
no, he said i was the eddie murphy of the art world. he said the eddie murphy.
why don't you answer?
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  and this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
since when do you shop at the flea market anyway?
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like?
if your duty requires it.
shouldn't you be in your room, jacob?
you must have come a long way.
the food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, cole?  to that "dying" world'
call me from new york before you leave??
well, look who's dressing for success.
you go down and see what's keeping dorothy.
thought you wrote you had a mustache.
you? no can do. it's all set. just a few of tom's closest friends.
so he knows your name?
very instructive
yeah, harding, where do you breathe anyway?
this place! this isn't 'a place.' it's my only world. i grew up in that house back there. i was a happy child. my mother and i... we were more than happy.
i should have damn well bought it.  well, we can't afford it.  the movie's going to eat up a year of my life and i'm getting paid next to nothing.  do you know how much skye davidson's getting?  four million.
could i speak to you for just a moment, please?
where do you want it?
drug evasion with....
yes?
you can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  everyone you ever bump into will know.  'well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
where's mother?
...a masterpiece...
come on out a minute, okay?
it's embarrassing.
let's talk about you for a change.
oh, hi... i almost didn't recognize you -- i think i need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
you don't have a fever.
what's the writing say?
maybe i do.  ...what a fuckin' mess, huh?  people can change brian.
you what?
sorry, pal.  entrance is for residents and guests only...
not even the birds sing sweet as you.
the magazines are one thing -- but hedda! why did we have to let her come?!
it's getting too cold even for me, nick.
i've almost finished the rocker. did she order mirrors?
i don't know. i'm goin' up to baltimore this afternoon.
excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
bullshit.  where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
stop, stop... i can't remember!  the battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... i was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself...
answer affirmatively.  simply. keep those answers to three words. you weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  isn't that right?
don’t you believe in simplicity?
is he in?
afraid of the hospital?
i'm a producer.
no.
winning isn't everything.
i thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
i don't know yet.  i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
it's kind of you to see me.
i love you so much, gabrielle.
throw me one.
the boston pops.  season tickets.
hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all i can say.
one of many people who would live a word with you.
well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. and it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
stevens?
i drove over and you were gone.
isn't that what all this is about?  letting jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
jeanette, you're hurting me.
protest to my superiors if you like.
johnny, slow down.  <u>think</u>.  you know mom didn't raise us to --
you don't seem like no fag...
everyone talking about it?  i wouldn't wonder.  all i seek is a genuine balance of power between the emperor and the senate.  thus i have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the senators.  this includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  it's a start, only a start.  if the emperor and the senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  this means commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created.
nothing.
i'd seen you writing in that book. at the embassy in cairo, when i had thumbs and you had a face. and a name.
now that's what i call fun.
yeah, how much you wanna bet?
it's the truth, i swear.
it's a saying, mr. bernstein.  a new broom sweeps clean.
active matrix, man. a million psychedelic colors. man, baby, sweet, ooo!
don't hang up!
what's this?  why did you change it?
i saw adcox's back! i saw the burn! i put it there! jesus christ, stephen, he's been killing people!
crash ain't there.  he never gets back till four or five--
ray, this is my life here. i ain't gonna pretend i'm not happy west is gone, but you know i couldn't have done this. it's not in me.
you ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
you don't understand this guy.
we go someplace dangerous.
oh shit.
i was downhearted
arrah!
and another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
susan told me that your visits to norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
well, she does know a lot about wine.
they can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. there's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
let me see.
yes, i would.
that's right! goddamn, you're the spitting image. i didn't know he had a son.
trip? you just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to kiss live at cobo hall tonight!
oh.  oh.  that's okay.  well.  this uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  i mean, i'm... god, i gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
give me that!
the "chronicle" is a good newspaper.
i was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of dijon.  it was an adjoining room to madame bonaparte's.
yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
oh, miss brown?
hello, hildy. i thought you were gone.
in the sight of god that is a sin.
the dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
she fucked me too.
i forgot to show you this. the gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
so mildred says to the cashier, 'i saw the new streisand picture.'  'god, i just love it at the end when she brushed robert redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. that look was so... romantic.'
i'm not looking for an apology, peter.
you don't look like you.
you needn't worry. it's over and done with. a long time ago.
is that me?
okay, jack.  nice doing business with you... cash is about to take off...
oh god...you knew.
he's not in valhalla! he died of old age!
i'll be along.
your home is quite disordered.  i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in.
you can't kill me, jon. i've got something going this saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything god ever dumped on the pharaohs -- and only i can stop it.
how you doing, great one?
so you'll get married in a new dress.
which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
i was trying to educate you.
hairy ?
he had help.  from our side, sir.
i was here the whole time.
you don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
i'm sure we will.
i did.  but princess margaret was a doll.  we're all equals in her eyes.  as commoners, i presume.
oh. i thought maybe --  gee!
dammit, kevin, what's with the attitude?
congratulations, dad.
delete in cutting 		) there . . .  a place called . . . houston . . .
standard, modern, upscale --
didn't you think it was funny, wendy?
who are you?
you just stick by old barbatus. he'll watch out for you.  whatsamatter, kid?  leave a girl behind?
if the other side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
i can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the mcp started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... i'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
i judge military matters, captain winthrop, not you.
why?
you think i'm an idiot?  remember our wedding?
go finish getting ready. i'll take care of dinner.
she was talented, but honey i wish i could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and i had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, i proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
one night is no betrayal. have pity on me.  please, i beg you, do not refuse me. you do not know the price.
i've literally got to run!
that's great!  see, you're getting it.
just ask me what you want to know.
caesar, what are we going to do?
forget it, kid. what's it *to* you?
interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for god's sake? i mean...
you need an ambulance.
don tommassino.
i didn't mean the things that i said... i was angry and i said more than i meant to.
not personally.
max!  what's wrong?
i'm sorry i've been acting like a jerk.  i do appreciate what you've done for me, and i know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and i do love you, even though i act like i don't.
nothing.
oh, yeah, yeah.
he wants me to come to his quarters.
listen, adele, the reason i called, that party is today instead of sunday. about eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  so you'll have to get hold of buddy, whatever he might be doing...
i've heard of it.
i was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
you could have killed us both!!
i'm sure you have
not much.
inspector.
but you don't understand.  she'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
even data?
small talk.
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown.
we'd be in the hole by now. hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
en garde.
where the fuck were you, man? i was dying in there. we were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
captain, this is saavik. we have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
i went to a turkish bath, who cares? the show was a flop.  what difference does it make?
gerry! any trouble finding the place?
i am really, deeply sorry.
do you miss it?  you seem like you do.
ready?
if you don't mind my asking... why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
where to?
more than you could afford.
nick, have i been a good partner?
no.
just back up.
all right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
i, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
i probably would have.  i guess the clues damn near before everyone.
how much?
i'm just having some fun.
don, this is my mother.  mom, this is my boss, don palmer.
mom--i mean, dad?
central intelligence agency -- c.i.a.
that's one way of putting it.  kitz, the president, the i.s.c. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the u.s. and europe.  until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
i will.
sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. that, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
you okay, man?  i mean, what just happened.
two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
why did i fall on you?
frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
well, i am.
i did. what about it?
nonononono. truce, you guys. listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? a wake up call for the nintendo generation. we demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. when i was a child, i spake as a child, i understood as a child, i thought as a child, but when i became a man i put away childish things.  what... it's corinthians i, chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. come on.
stewart! we're all waiting for you. where's your valet?
good night.
i said - i suspect the secretary of war.
i happened to be passing, and i thought you might like some corfee.
i know what <u>that's</u> like.  anyway, i brought a copy of the script.  you would play the "ghoul's wife."
you mean you have finished the whole investigation?
he's <u>dead</u>.  he's <u>dead</u>.  the fella killed old shoe. 
your father doesn't like mexicans.
has his story changed?
wait a minute. all right. hold on.
cool your jets...i'm doing a little damage control.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
okay, boys, let's have it.
why is cole here?
no. he's dead.
dr. milo, please don't call my wife mad.
how do you do?  i came here - and i made mr. kane come with me...  because i recieved this note -
now, joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
a nigger cook.
i was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
you're leaving?
[beat] i've seen a time that's not this time. and i'm only able to see it when i'm in the jacket.
we had a tough year.
after my hiatus, after i got my priorities readjusted, i drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for zero. got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. never found zero, but i did come across some class a scumbags.
they're not gonna let us in vada, we're kids.
jesus christ, we're only going nine miles.  be there in two hours, tops!
they were yellow!
when we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  this is my man, you dig?  my informant. you know what an informant is?
who said you could grow up so fast ? last time i checked you were only five years old. you had such a bright little face...
"life is crushing in on me."
back off, man.
pull back.  you can't make the jump.
yes. we had a glorious night together. one day you'll remember and write about it.
is that an insult?  are you insulting me.
nothing, dad. just re-arranging the furniture.
this can't be happening?
what do you mean, thank god?
maybe if i kiss him i'll feel it.
what? why'd you do that?
this is why you don't show work in progress.
do you always walk around with a sword?
if you will wait one moment, sir.
hey, i was just trying to ...
i wish they were vampires so i could nuke them in their hearts.
what's that?
i didn't put you in alpine grove.
she has an aunt, in vermont. i'll take her there tonight.
cast iron?
because i never have.  that's why you go places, isn't it?
oh no, you're not. you've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
you're fucked in the head.
black market during the war.
if you tell me where the leads are, i won't turn you in.  if you don't, i am going to tell the cop you stole them, mitch and murray will see that you go to jail.  believe me they will.  now, what did you do with the leads?  i'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
well?
it's easy to see the purser hasn't had much practice.
yes. that's the deal. she plays lorna.
yes it is.  can we please not do that? please?  cause it is.
queer?
...like a fish.
technically, they are still under the clemenza wing of the corleone family, now run by frankie pentangeli.  after clemenza died, the rosatos wanted territory of their own.  pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  i, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the tropicana matter, turned him down.  pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. i was lucky and he was stupid. i'll visit him soon.  the important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  this thing of ours, that we will build.
i can't believe this is happening. i'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
jack?
i swear to god.
calm down. tell me what's wrong.
how does it feel, keith?
some of this native nonsense. the houngan has his prescription and dr. maxwell and i have ours.
two words.  disco express.
maybe it's gone.
blue moon...
why, yes.
take us up.
you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? the army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? there's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
empty as a football.
what if i asked you not to?
i love you don with all my heart.
what did you find out, mike?
how's life treating you?
open that door, damn you!
no, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
what is it you want?
no, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
i'll have to enclose the check first.
oh, imperfections?
if you'll excuse me i'm not feeling so well.
... is over.
sue, i need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
what?
then don't you realize the bomb gives us peace not war?  and, if that's the case, i ask you again: why do they want disarmament?
we're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
help me rhonda.
we don't even like each other, do we?
she had the same.
i suppose that's right.
not here...no thanks.
ok, bob.
those are cold.
is that my birthday cake? may i see?
i'11 take my chances then. i'11 feel safer without a job if a man like mr. kint is behind bars.
well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
damn baby, relax.  i'm getting to it.  from philadelphia following the route highlighted to pacifica california -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
close the curtains. the sun is hurting my eyes.
bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
elaine!  ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the middle east.
you bastards.
it had the virtue of never having been tried.
dr. woodly.  i should make a little list.
i could do it this saturday -- everyone wants off for the correspondents' dinner.
boy, we really gave it to her good.
do you know what year it is?
you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
i don't understand.
what did you want?
i believe it takes both. i'd have to look it up.
you can save that pretty woman shit. the name is domino.
what business is you in, homer?
let's rush him.  he's not going to blow us all up.
no, you're not model material.  anything else?
pop?
rosalie, please, listen to me! you have to stop.
what are you <u>doing</u>?  where's george?
dorothy parker--
your room.
good morning, vanessa! i hope you have on clean underwear.
i don't know, willow.
you said 'whoopsidaisies.'
i'm the same person i was before you knew, damn it! oh god!
nothing. just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
but this is nature!  why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  i mean, condors. condors are on the verge of extinction - - if i'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
i can't?
seems exciting.
and his passport photo? did you hear? to scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  i've thought about going to the police but i can't face it. i can't face anything anymore.
why did you want her body?
he should be king!
yeah.  so sue me.
that place is already bad luck.
yes.
what do you know? you wouldn't know the first thing about writing. you're the most ignorant person i've ever met!
swimming with his hat on?  that's original.
kirk here.
how about if next week some time i put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
he'll find us, won't he?
what do you figure it is?
but then how can you...
the ottos.
good. what else? anything interesting?
oh, jesus...
letitia.
want to join me?
this was my father's old study. when i was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. when i was older, i learned many things from him here.  i was happy that this house never went to strangers; first clemenza took it over, and then you.  my father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  never.  if hyman roth sees that i interceded with you in the rosato brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  i'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  we have friends in some very important business that we're making.  do this for me; you make the peace with the rosato brothers on their terms.  let the word out that i forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  it will get back to hyman roth.  do this, frankie.  you can trust me.
i hope you don't think i owe you anything. because i don't owe you a damn thing.
you see, quaid, none of my people could get close to kuato.  the fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  so hauser and i sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
louie, take this lady over to polack mike's and lock her up. see that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
you're on your own, understand?
you ever go to the kelbo's? on pico?
kathryn...
oh. right.  i guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
this is good. uhh...
why do you think that?
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
the redistribution of wealth.
lilly's up.
so, i see you're really into spooks.
why, i'm assisting you, sir.
hey look at this!
how are you going to find him?
grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
charlie. i just had the strangest dream.
no.
maybe they didn't want it back. maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
we just gotta catch the bastard, right?
i understand he was wounded in the lung.
slower! nobody can row at that speed!
i'm getting out now.
never mind all that. what did you find out?
hi frances, got a minute?
how much time do you have left on it?
are you going to take her with you?
you're losing your blood?
it wouldn't matter except steve should be getting back pretty soon. it wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
hell no. my dad was a straight up tin soldier. somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. had a court martial and everything. the charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
i don't like animals.  never have. dog bit me when i was little.  after that i gave up on pets.  animals are irrational.  give me a psychotic killer any day.  if there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  my first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  it was late august.  over ninety.  the polar bear was inside his cave.  kids didn't know he was in there.  all they saw was the pool. they got to swimming and splashing. the noise woke up the bear.  by the time i arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. i can still hear the mother screaming --
what doesn't?
i don't hear anything.  maybe you've been down here too long.  why don't you go back up and -
course he can talk. he's a human being, like. isn't he?
no. she's probably scared to death.
are you sure?
talk to me artie.
yeah.
well, you tried.  you failed miserably, but you tried.
why you left.
gondorff, you gonna teach me the big con or not?
looks very solid, lilly. sit down. take a minute, tell me about it.
this is the apartment we have reserved for you, comrade yakushova. i hope you like it.
who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
lester, this is my friend jill and this is johnny pope.
and you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
mrs. robinson?
that’s when i realized i wanted to be a doctor.
well, i certainly would have heard about that.
that's certainly possible.
i hear they need a new lieutenant... want the job ?
speed up.
well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  you know, get all that city grit out of it.
spooky.
the don himself is coming to me tonight?
so, edwin, baby, this is sunrise confession time... what have you got for us?
what for?
check it out!
of all the people in the world, you're the only one i have anything to offer.  that's why i came here.
i'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
you must have a lot of confidence in me.
well --
oh?
i've got 'em!  they're back on my screens!
well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
i admit i handled it badly.  sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
commander...
i'm sorry. that was nasty.
this is it!  we think it makes vegas look like the corner crap game.
how much money do you have in your pockets?
that was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
of what?
good one!  thanks.
bring her about.  we're headed in the wrong direction....
okay, burt, listen.  forget shooting them.  tell me this: can you get to your truck?
yes.
had to leave?  believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  we stayed.
can i bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
okay?
they didn't teach it at memorial hospital.  i had my suspicions, though, about the directress of training.
it's up there, on the tower.
the, uh, blur there.
i do if you do.
'yes' what?
there's no comparison.
so what made you change your mind about sidney?
beautiful!
how'd you do it, old man?
helen's going to be pissed.
blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
i know you didn't. but you a grown girl. you can handle it. i got to.
...look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
the kid - junior, that is - will be right down. unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
pause as he takes all this in i think your dad would miss you.
please sit down.  i told your wife. i'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  i've got a case coming in two days in the  superior court and my office is a mess of papers.
what is it?
and you still reach for your piece every time.
i don't believe you.
i'm in charge. we go back!
it makes life spicy.
wait.
you know -- hemingway, sexton, woolf, plath, delmore schwartz. you can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
what's abba?
here's the picture of my wife.
whoooooah!  oh!  bo!  there's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
i don't remember. not so very far--
what was i supposed to think happened to you?!
what about the body you found?
tonight then.
shit.  it's my galiano.
how'd you like a little payback? not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  did you know loew was a swish?
early eighteenth century. i should say around--seventeen thirty.
you were right, don sanchez... his demands could never be granted.
they're all in it.
yeah. what are you doing now?
the police shouldn't have started shooting. but you can hardly blame them. you surprised them. they didn't know you were up there. when they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
what do you mean, dude?
deceitful! two-faced! she-woman! never trust a female, delmar! remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
he didn't ask me to...
that's right brother... listen and learn.
there's no hurry. it's early.
i strongly feel that a negro should direct this.  this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. one misstep and we're doing "amos and andy."  only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
i hate having my picture taken.
yes.
they're awful.  they make me cough.
well, i hope he wins.
i know what you are thinking.  i'm not going to disappear, okay?  i'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  i got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
that is our most modestly priced receptacle.
you like this? walkin' me through this field like i's your mule?
the answers you seek can be found in heaven on earth.
fifteen crowns.
so where's the harm?
now i didn't mean that, you rat.
no.
you leave me no choice.
jessie, jessie, copy?
now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? don't you know who's in that car?
thank you, doctor.
what is it?
so... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
an' all my meals for free...
obeah.
there's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
foreman wants to get the ore out. miner wants to get his brothers out. in one piece.
i just remembered i have urgent business in this direction.
to quarter-horses.
-- you could have scared the son of a bitch off. we may never bust him now. all for a couple's political points.
yes. why do you find that so hard to believe?
saddle up, roughnecks !
more plainly and more distinctly? i have not come to new haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of yale! i have come to tell you that you will not marry lloyd - or anyone else - because i will not permit it.
what the fuck are you talking about? i converted when i married cynthia! come on, dude!
then what's love?
you told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. i gave you three. what happened?
look, i love you katka but i'm twelve years older, i could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
but i assure you, father walters, miss connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
how did he look?
i'm just saying i think if we met under different circumstances...
during the trial, you did all those stories about me. you called me a liar.
beer please! do you want another drink?
...blake
inga!

who wouldn't.
what the fuck is going on down there?!
but...
shoes?
shit o goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
you have?
clips.
help!
biology, mostly.
what?
cabbie drove around all night.  three people got killed.
what's it going to be, elizabeth? seventy—five? eighty?
he's very pale. covered with scars.
stop it!  you don't deserve the green destiny.
some people do it for enslavement
you come here often?
there were five stones in the beginning. over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
everything's fine, honey. we don't need to talk. besides i have to work late.
forgery and fraud?
what was that all about? i thought everything must go!
am i? maybe to a schoolboy's eye. people who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
you mean it?
... yeah...
he sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
janet, are you okay? are you there?
now what?
then what are you doing in park slope? it's a little far from home, isn't it?
sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
don't be an idiot. how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? if vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
...just that the witch is so wicked. i don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
hmm. to protect you both from the emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. the emperor knew, as i did, if anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
this has nothing to do with your fire.
bravo!  bravo!  magnifico!
thanks, baby.
come on, cohaagen!  you got what you want.  give these people air!
so they're trying to kill you and your baby. don't tell me.  your name also happens to be rosemary.
that's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
but -
donut, get your camera. see if it's broke.
hiya, buddy-boy.  i'm in this bar on sixty-first street -- and i got to thinking about you -- and i figured i'd give you a little buzz.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
you better believe i can.  i'm sick of people telling me what i have to do.
you two make quite a couple.
a good place for what?  he's insane!
eight.
was it a party?
salots! shitfucker!
has anything happened lately? anything unusual or unexpected?
i know you're as unhappy as i am about debbie's marriage to rick.
i sense your teachings in him. ignore the regular order of training. his safety requires the voice.
"there is a justice higher than that of man. i will be judged by him."
it's dangerous!!
how repulsive!
i don't know, you think eddie will give me his autograph?
have you always had to--work?
you told junior that we did it.
if there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
whoever sent you, i'll pay double.
a four hundred dollar lunch tab!
this can't be happening to me.
have fun.
you girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
and what do you see?
what?
he knew exactly what we'd be looking for. made sure to cover up all his tracks.
what is?
i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts. too bad no one else did.
find the feet?
no, no. i wouldn't hire a display designer if i didn't trust her taste. maybe we should bring in more of that shade. perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
this guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
will, bowman just broke the code. it was a james beard cook book. you need to know what it says right now.
why? did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  i won't get shocked. i'm used to this!  my father was a true pig. he fucked the bitch i'd as mother all around the apartment. whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  and my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
how'd you get in here.
yours was fully illustrated, honey.
like when you were standin' there looking after clay. i knew right off what you were thinking. because i've been watching you.
where you going? i'll walk along with you.
no, actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? people get all hung up on details, but what's the point? like which school? does it matter? why? when? where? or how many o grades did i get? could be six, could be one, but that's not important. what's important is that i am, right? that i am.
and what did they say about me?
that's not going to look too good on your service record.
there isn't enough medford rum in the whole of new hampshire to make me sleepy. 
they should be here any minute.
why so briefly?
let me get your change.
whoa -- why?
and where is joseph?
"get her?"  that was your whole plan?  you call that science?
can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
we'll split up the week.  you can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
colonel, sir, mrs. washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
may i cut in, miss?
it'll never work.
how prominent?
i'm sorry...
let me talk to you.
he has you on a pedestal.  and me in his arms.
well i interviewed damon once for the show. he was a real obnoxious fuck. any way, the second one, christine perkins, she had a part in stab 2, didn't she? she was playing cici.
what the fuck are you talkin' about?
it's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  i don't meet the other girls.  aren't you gonna get undressed?
you’ve been jack campbell.  and that’s always a good thing...
yeah, of course.
i've been thinking about it, that's all.
god, i think josh is too mature for us.
don't worry. i'm gonna get you out of here.
yes.  i looked.  i remember clearly now.  it seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  i was scared.
i called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
fine, then how many nights home is that?
i want you to take this, lenny. today's your day of atonement. i know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
then it's true, isn't it? about...
look, can i just borrow your car?!  i promise it’ll be returned!
goddammit, i don't need this aggravation.  i'll shoot you, ben.  bank on it.
one d-6 and one d-8 in the well. and a dead d-8 on the deck.
i should go.
i tell you, charley, i haven't made up my mind!
i'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
good hundred yards, i'd say.
robert...?
keep your head down.
another couple of good men get burned up for their city? is that how it's going to read?  you're the only one that knows.
and what did you do?
did you notice all those weird things on the menu? like "the salad explosion"?
because that's understandable, because. she blew the raid.
what happened?
i don't know why i've told you all this.  i hardly know you.
but...what kind of a shooting war?  have they hit any of our cities yet?
now hurry, hurry.  i will watch!  your desires may be my pleasure also...our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  you must...hurry now.
would you want to work with us on this?
i suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
i have been at the library.
you a fag too?
you sure those doors will be open?
cynthia, i don't know.
yes.
evan, you're hysterical. you study for this?
will i see you again?
forgive my crudity, darlin'. all i'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
we're stuck with this...
but expressively broken.  how did it happen?
brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  in which case you just warned them.
yes.
you want out?
so when are you authorized to use deadly force?
breakfast beetle?  beetle?  beetle fruit?  fruit bat?  fruit battle? volkswagen?  fruit wagon?
exactly. it's time to make decisions.
i don't need your gratitude.
yes?
it worked!
you'll find a rambling rose and a picket fence
more.
it's our secret.  honest.  how can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
it's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
honey!  wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
what's the matter? you on their team now? you think i'm the guy?
how did you know?
but i want to make some changes. get krista in here right away won't you?
c'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
why did you break into that particular building?
you know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved mrs. halpern and katie.
why don't you come back with me?
unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
sonofabitch.
the ice is melting.
yep, you guessed it.
it can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
yeah? what have you got to do?  look at you. look at your face. all the things you must be thinking. man, you must really hate my guts. well, you know what? it's okay.
maybe i should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and i'd never clean it up.
i didn't buy it i made it.
right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
the first time, when they attacked long ago, was the beast here?
yeah, sure.
somebody's killed the power!!
cause you're the man, right?  the magic man.  if it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
no. i don't, mitch. because i can't see any reason for it.
wet your eyes, boy.  stay in there for about 20 minutes.
ten thousand right here.
do you ever do any writing?
all right 
what do you mean, they won't come?
you think she sure 'nough your sister?
ernie goose?  cynthia?
i don't believe you.
think about it: you knocked out that jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. maybe lost his whole line of clientele? he knows you're fucking up jess' dancing, and i got a feeling he knows i stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. he can't kill us in la cause that leads to too many questions. so he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? he can make us disappear out here real nice...
i better give you my address then.
the thing that started all of this.
eight cops?  oh, great.  a jury's gonna love that.
did you break a cup, jack?
i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer... sir.
i'd like to pay you for that laptop.
i'm still here.
what tables?  i've never seen him before.
someone from another world--so entirely different. one gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! and everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... and then i heard your name and found you were just one of us.
hell yes.  he does this every year. there's nothing to worry about.
we have to prepare you for an audience with sophie.
there's two reasons a man rejects help.  either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
okay. okay, look my wife called the police. they're coming. it's not too late. they'll come, they'll take care of her. i'm going inside.
it's a fine spot, ma'am.
speak! go on.	speak again.
huh?
i see. tell me, harold, do you remember your father at all?
virginia, i'm flattered you think i got that much energy. i just figured if i can't find paul sheldon, at least i can find out what he wrote about.
can't tell. every time i try her, you look away. or you make noises. maybe you don't want to know.
yeah, it'll be fun.
yes it does! we could be at sea for months.
it's more involved than that.
that's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
did you kill her?
dad's fixin' something again.  hit the deck!
dudley, we've been over this.
why?
you got a .44 magnum?
say you promise.
someone worthy of respect, lad.  she be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
then will you teach me what i need to know.  maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
what do you think? ... is it me?
take a walk, pal.
i don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  this used to be the main highway.  want to register, please?
i know.
how many men are working with you on this?
what if the japanese did invade?
hello, david. i am dr. hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, mr. collins.
but we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
good. i'm sure we'll be friends.
hurry!
fucking grifters! i love it! you got balls, i'll give you that much.
this guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  where did he come from? who is he?
our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. awacs contact on four hour intervals.
mr. carter, merry christmas.
then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
little lebowski urban achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. i asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but i tell you it is preposterous.  this compulsive
did you have to use that much explosive?
murder.
i love you, too.
well can we--
mason verger.  for he cannot be free. dr. lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  can <u>you</u> be free....?
it's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. they're jumping in terror.  bigger fish want to eat them. that luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. it's the glitter of putrescence.  there's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. thanks sweetie. millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip.  theo takes the other glass.
schaefer, i gotta see this welles picture
never play with someone's else's cards. you always get a new deck. look at this card. see anything?
what the hell is that for?
maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
you sure? i thought the rag had to touch?
i'm not taking drugs, dad.  can i go to bed now?
the cards are now my only livelihood.  sometimes i am in luck, and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  it's property, look you, and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me. when the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste.  do you understand the cards?
he'll win.
i had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
maybe i could start you out.
all right, all right, so we can say he is good.
their arms?
pinta likes him too much.  she thinks of him as a father.
i can't believe you really meant it, if i did i'd want to die. you aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
you see, it s like i say. you always have an answer for everything.
malaysia's tanking.  we're meeting in ten in operations.
oh, i'm not? i'm not? then what's my last name?
my apartment's just such a mess.
-- objection, your honor! this case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
objection!
amy, you remember the party invitations edward, gave you to mail?
i don't know! i just said that!
...afraid.
harder...
that is a matter of opinion.
give a guy a break, huh?
i can see that... now what can you tell us about it? first of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
i will once i get past the bulkhead.  good luck.
if we run into billy first, let me try and talk him in.
le vingtieme siecle. we're meeting armitage there for the midnight floor show.
my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
he has lots of disks.
ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. it doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  this is a warm-blooded creature.  they're totally wrong.
we have to stop them from sending that message.
maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it.
i have to pee.  if the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
you're in with them.
thank you.
they've got no chutes. they can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
gotta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one, or close enough. gonna take time.
it made me ill.  you could get fired for things like that.
mr. shakespeare has given me the part of the apothecary!
i know i'd be a good father. i know you'd be a good mother.
had a package to deliver.
wait... he knows.
i don't know. i thought i did. now i'm not sure. i thought it had something to do with me.
as your attorney, i advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
not at all.  i enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
that's not true.
well listen, i know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
it can't wait until tomorrow...
trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
hi, joe.
i told you,  we're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
i work in a shitty video store. i want to go to a good video store so i can rent a good movie.
then maybe you can read mine.
what did you see? what did it look like?
frank.
tank, you're hurt.
your small convent is in danger of closing, reverend mother.  the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
yeah? what three words, harry?
i spoke to dr. argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
all or nothing.  you want to roll them for me?
yeah, buddy?
lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
you’re having a bad day, i’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
yes.
'fraid not, your majesty.  goodbye, your majesty.
no.
just do it.
let it ride for a while.
in other words, you want to get laid?
what do you want?
we walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
hey, things could be worse. it could've been my money. let me help you out, rookie.
what are you reading?
you know you can always talk to me.  right?  whatever is going on in your life, your mom and i'll understand.
your honor, that's not fair -- !
we went to a hotel.
you know you keep saying that.
i can't get over what those guys did to her. i just can't.
hurry!
she's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
don't do that!
you know how to make chocolate milk?
yeah, yeah— here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
welcome to my parlor said the riddler to the bat. how's tricks?
but not always. i was -- he was... other stuff too.
this is work.
would you take me back? would they?
he's not talking about himself.
doesn't make sense.  how the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
what do you do?
well you'll always be sadie to me.
baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
it is, isn't it?  my life as a game of strip poker.  shall we play?
-- what's the problem, honey?
that's not enough.
stop that dog!
she isn't here.
how was your evening?
oh, i couldn't do that! the blacksmith's code says...
i suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
for some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. no matter. i had hoped to have the wedding next spring, lord turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. but fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
well, i guess it's about that time.
i don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. the idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
took no chances, did he?  and when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? but you were the one who screamed. why did you scream?
no, you would not, louis. danger hold you to me.
i don't think so. they've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. but sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
i'm afraid so, colonel.
oh. i mean, good.
stand by, sir. miracle worker at work...
fair enough, but i’m stepping on toes here and you’re waltzing around like...
pike and i got separated --
no, count it, anyway.
assholes. this happen to you?
it's unbelievable.
well, i... i... i don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. it wasn't billy, i didn't know him.
yes it is. it's a law of the universe. if i let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
that's what i'd like to know. if you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
i have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
i think this is a big part of growing up. it's losing your spiritual virginity. it's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. they're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
jesus.
peter, where are you?
oh, lestat. i must do more than that. i've brought a present for you.
i've had these dumb dreams lately.
did i say thanks?
the japs did it.
the driver waved. so casual, friendly.
he doesn't know you're up there!  just stay right where you are!  call the police!
best beer in the world?  budweiser for me, thanks.
it would worry me.
it's the only frontier i have left, plumcake.
just a guess. did you have it good with your wife? you know, sex.
you would never give up life. if the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. you see too clearly. you see too much.
i wish to possess what you have now.
but they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
i don't know.
i'm afraid not.
hello?
that's my dad.
your expenses are your own.
..when you think about it, ethan, it was inevitable..no more cold war.  no more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  then one morning you wake up and find out the president of the united states is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  the son-of-a- bitch!  how <i>dare</i> he?  you realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
no.

i'd like to.
quite a while.
if that ain't the truth.  and i count on them for a little bit of stew meat...thank you, fred.
really?
good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
someone dead from this household?
he never even asked. he just assumed --
that's not always a healthy way to be...
once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in africa. well, one day this king got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --

almost five!
i hate people with alliterative names.
oh yeah! "desperately seeking spawn." they're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. it's totally legit.

romirez understood.  not you.
why didn't you say anything? you scared me to death.
you know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
no.  i have children, grandchildren too.  i visit when i can.  but now that mr. jimmy cannot be left very long, i do not get away much.  poor mr. jimmy.  there is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  very sad.
"before i kill you."
legally, she can't take that stuff. legally, she can't take the stuff.
it's called "burger manifesto, part one the dialectical expression of testosterone." isn't that a great title?
coming along, jabez?
sarah.  sarah, this is dr. silber- man.  i'd like you to tell him everything reese said to you.  do you feel up to it?

viridian?  what is...?

rinaldi... rinaldi...  what region do you come from?
manson beat you.

he sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
all right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
good morning, mr. kirkeby.

i'll always go back to that church.

what is it with you people and pain?
what do they want you or?
look, frances, i didn't want this job. think i'm crazy? but you begged me: improve your image. so please... lemme try, huh?
as a robbery.
i haven't seen one dollar from you.  you haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
you're pretty good at arithmetic.
it's like a song.
okay, then we'll see you there.
was quite excited, when he came in...
bobby, this is a plumb gig. it's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. it's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
you have got me there. old don is as useless as tits on a boar.  but, he is my brother-in-law, and i would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.

i was looking for you.
not that. look at what i wrote down cause i can't say it.
you talk to the married couple?
well, i'm not coming, barbie. so you guys have fun.
we had to see what your deal was. i'm just a little superstitious.
i've got all this back pay coming.  why don't you let me get you a place in town?
so that others would know about this place?
yes.
stop picking on him.
i'm gonna take her home first.
i didn't know then that i was a nigger.
what?
bullet proof vests don't bleed.
well, let's recap, shall we? you slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our love gun 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  so, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... i'd say we learned it.
i thought you were going to help carl.
well, i ain't like that no more, ned. i ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
and that you're stupid?
rowan mayfair.  who's calling...?
what happened?? where are we?!
yes, sir -- it certainly does!
wine, women and song.
it's s'posed to happen, biff.
i been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. boys say they heard he's a real hard case. spit-and-polish man. full- bird colonel name of payne, they say-- bet you never figured you end up back here.
respect? well, isn't that progressive.
that was before dr. zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy.
sobek.  half man, half croc, oldest god--
i remember you.
hey, you're still here.  i suppose you like it here with us.
you're in league with barbossa!
we're damaged goods.
sign here and here.  hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
if necessary i can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
i'm not. but there's --
yes.
oh, how do you do?
i can't understand a thing like this. it's something you almost never see.
what's his problem?
he unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. no more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
close call.  for the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. life's tenuous.
someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
a cat. we found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  neighbors are watching for it.
is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
what do you think?
sorry, sir.  division is using everything on wheels to get up to caen.  how come you guys aren't going?
the containment, second containment...
i've never done this before.
i'm going in after him.
10 million years earlier. humpbacks were heavily hunted by man. they have been extinct since the 21st century... it is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
the red sox

now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
when the europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
yeah, i made some money down there, then i talked my way into another college and i did it. i wasn't magna cum laude but i did okay. you should've seen me in my cap and gown.
it's time to wake up.
this fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
what are you doing?
you was quotin' scripture. you said -- you said, "and a little child shall lead them."
chief knows.
i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home. i also promised that we would never come in there again.
she laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... she said she wanted to be friends.
there's no one "looking at you" .. there's hardly anyone in here. the only person looking at you, is me.
how'd you people happen to pop in?
well, your uncle was chairman of the board of directors. they probably expect you to carry on.
listen, in two days i'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  and i want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
just ran into a little trouble.
yeah, uh, i don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... listen, can i call you right back? i gotta take this call...
listen ... i've got it! it came to me like a thief in the night! pure inspiration! total magnificence!
uh, let me get back to you...
why?
so you're goin' to the gophers on sunday?
your daddy and i are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
do we know what this says?
i don't understand.
what?
here i come!
how were things between you and frank?
i'll be all right. don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.

what'd you wish, george?
so. this is the guy you been waiting for. man of your dreams.
yes! i've told senator paine for twenty years--
sorry to bother you, sir. i have some rather distressing news about master dick.
but why would they murder...
i can't breathe, i'm suffocating.
guys, let's not panic.  isabella's safe.
you must help us, leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to siberia!
good lord.
he's not in, sir.
nothing, i'm dressing.
look, what you worried about glenn for?  what's he know?
what'd you think, boy?  that you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  not by a long shot.  you're just the most gullible.  how much did you get?
does that worry you?
let go of me...
i'm not sure that it is the plague.
no.  no.  cut.  -- justine, we agreed.  no questions about the watchmen.
the fifth room is your broadcast room.
commander, what are you doing here?
this...  ...this is what my life has become. stuff in boxes. stuff underground. is that so appealing to you?
who brought me in here?
what if she isn't?  where are your priorities?  you have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  the girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  he dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
with all due respect, mr. gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
to the demon king's castle, of course.
i am once more about to make advertising history. and only you, the original yoni yum/dew girl, could possibly assist me.
okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. voila!
'cause you like their second one, you said, pop, girls. etc.  the one with cheryl ladd on the cover.  you didn't see the cover though.
you're just like you mother! always jealous!
the shower again?
that's what i am.
it's a little boxy thing, norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
let's continue.
asked what they looked like, that's all. christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
i don't know. but you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
i wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
negative.  absolutely not.  the phase two assault team will get them out.
because i hate him--because i love you!
look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. you send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
why are we stopping here?
have you got a pencil?
the car's no there yet?
clive had a job. i didn't. i couldn't.
--yes. and the munich olympics in '72. a local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
a card? for her fiftieth birthday?
i'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. so far i haven't been able to find him.
you're on, kid...i'll square it with mom your not seeing her before you left.  and i'll get a message to your girl friend when i think the time is right.
give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
jeff lebowski.  come on.  this other jeffrey lebowski.  the millionaire. he's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . and he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no fucking reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  am i wrong?
good thing i'm here to do the thinking.
i was bewitched... it's better this way...
sounds good. but right now i should go.
hunh?
eh! love...what a mystery!  i understand you, toto...the ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  eh, there's nothing to be done about it! the heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. and if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
kurtz.
tell me he's living in squalor. tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
can you keep sam straight?
so?!  is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
i just think you should show some respect.  i mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when ben franklin and those guys signed the constitution and declaration of independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
pretty nasty out, mac.  thirty-five knots.
caesar, you just killed gino marzzone.
not a word.
oh, uh, i meant to tell you... alex brought that fabric over...
wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
louise... are we still going to mexico?
major, you're talking like one of them!
how about the caitlin bree walk on the boardwalk, then get naked somewhere kind of private date?
buffy, this is crazy.  what do these guys want?
devoted entirely to the interests of all the john does all over the country. which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. he will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. a man whom he, personally, recommends. a great humanitarian; the best friend the john does have.
what the hell happened to my car?
what?
why didn't you send the money over?
i wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
the movie.

that might be the news we've been waiting for.
don't be a good neighbor to her or i'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. you know what a love letter is? it's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. understand, fuck?
so what are you gonna tell him?
i hate the mets.
what?
i told you.
why are you ashamed?
are you crazy?  you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
guinan, what are you doing here? i thought you were on the enterprise.
i think he's got a point.
the suspects!  they won't come.
that will mean another interview, won't it?
hello.
your son.
and when will you be ready to do that?
does the name pierre dreyer mean anything to you? he’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
you can't!  they'll be defenseless against their dreams.
if you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  but how?
what about the president?
how long has it been -- a month?
say, baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
why do i say that?  randal... forget it.
four cases in three years ...
mmmm --
well, just as i thought.  surely it's all been a terrible mistake. this parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
the point of what?
yeah, i'm kidding, i'm kidding. you don't think i should turn him in... .
i just love being a sister.
good luck, captain.
but dad, i'm asking about me. what do you think i should do?
 a slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, i need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
come on, drink up.
what's the rush? there's no first act. they'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
this is the best part, sid. billy's got it all figured out. why do you think we kept your father alive so long? why did we save you for last?
'horse and hound.'  the name's william whacker.  i think she might be expecting me.
why?
now, i'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
you are.
well, you stick to that story, son.
right here, chief.  sorry i lost you last night.  damn thing keeps cutting out.
is that another christmas present?
don't fuck with me.
spock, what is it? do you know this vulcan?
not like this... they don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  i never really noticed them much...
say more.
you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
so where are all your toys?
you told bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
yeah, so he's like "check the front of my truck, i can prove i hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
maybe he'll get back to work.
really?  was the third act too intense?
what is it?
i guess so.
okay, here's what i want.  i know about this stuff.  a five-star hotel.  with room service.
i know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. i'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
oh no--
i'm an old friend of the mayor's.  i just want to say hello to him.
sure.
shit, maybe he'll kill you.
do you have your own cell?
what's the idea, anne?
really?
which also means when i speak, i'm speakin' for jimmy. so e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
look -- could i use your phone?
dr. symington, how big is your dick?
she fucked you?
what is this?
i'm off.
martin, uh, we've found it.
a myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
stu was with me last night.
mitchell?  mitchell's ... family.
that's it, you look like a professional.
dorothy next!
it was just... more convenient as i was among soldiers...
not bad.
pot metal?
over here.  i want you to meet somebody.
i swear to you i wouldn't have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case...
maybe . . . ten-thousand.  and that's a maybe.
really?
i'm sorry that was out of line.
i will be in just a minute.
annie, it's liz. how's grace?
i wouldn't -

red.
god's blessing.
and what can he do for you?
there seems to be something wrong with the escape hatch...
why do you care about this kind of stuff?
what list?
yes.
what's the problem?
what would you do with it, the printshop...
i don't know.  they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
louise?  where are we?
so, juno. first off, how far along are you?
good morning.
i don't know.     maybe if we did just leave --
it's just possible she didn't...

great.  i got some wine.
you've taken some strange journeys in your life.
there's nothing like them in the fossil record, i'm sure...okay, so they predate the fossil record...  that'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  right.
where have you been?
my father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
no, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i'm telling sheriff potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. and darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
better person than i.
because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
i know what you mean, i recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and david's still getting over leslie.  his wife.

yeah. yeah.
then i will consider it a declaration of war. one. two... three.
ringo!
i don't.

correct.
chill, i'm the brains behind this outfit.
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth.
i'm coming in now. i'm down by the emergency air lock. too much trouble to come in the ventral lock. would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so i can come in?
he knows.  don't worry, tess. it's a man.
let's not close our eyes. there are many good things to see here too.
how do you know?
coordinated by polymer neural net.
even more reason to see him.  he'll be overjoyed with your success.
... what were you saying, admiral? something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
i thought you were giving up that drug shit.
we're not getting paid then.
that's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
hey, boys.
said what?
i don't?
no!
can i help?
no, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
when i wanted to.
how'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
this isn't a for-real suicide thing. this is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
no.
is he for real?
that's a thousand million electron volts.
oh. right. well, let's try not to think about that.
edicon system made these.  ages, photographs.  we use it to find missing children.
this was a very difficult decision, because i have three wonderful sons. i mean, adrian, so smart, so ruthless. and cassius, so strong, so tough. and nicky, so... so...
the attitude, damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
hey? you like to walk.
so what? don't smile like that, jesus!
i don't know why i associate with you, mr. barnard - or mr. chalmers bryant - or mr. embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
i'm looking for...
i ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
i liberated it.
del's dead, by the way. i sent him to the great beyond.

movie star hookers.  whatever you desire... it's fleur-fr-lis again.
sorry, i --
he's not treating her right...
i know where he is.
what city?
no. i mean. i don't know.  what else do you know about him?
you think you are ready now?
what will i tell the others? they care about you.
if i can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
would i lie to you?
yes.  yes.  that's exactly it.  yes.
one of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. when that happens, you'll wish you had family.
it's a surprise.
you did it for me.
as we look up, we see the president biting his lip, and continuing with the speech.
roy?  you still with us?
don't let victor push you into making a mistake --
at least our obituaries will be accurate.  that's reassuring.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
you made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  what do you think i'm doing?
now, holly's not shy.
how's that?
you're somewhere else, where?
with... with annie, of course.
now i'd like to be alone.
jesus...
she's coming back. i know she's coming back.
doing what?
what do you want from me?!  whatever you gonna do to me, just do it! and let me go!
we've got our best people on it, mr. sayer.
not something they tell dependents.
oh.
kenny'll come running back. this is just his way of pressuring you.
ma'am, how could you not report this?  he puts human life at risk and--
it couldn't be me.  i hardly knew him.
i need to ask you something, mr. nelson.
i told you, i had to teach a few people a lesson!
yes.  look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
course we care.  what good's the world locked in a season of death. frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... think that's an enjoyable prospect?
what a load of crap. hell, a week ago i hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
tell us, jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
you said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. are you crazy? she is possibly involved in murder. this gives me the creeps.

it's still available i hope?
jesus.  what is this?
do you want to try your father again? 
mrs. kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
no.
the hell are you fiddling with there?
told you the snow was coming down. take the grader.
you stay out of this, glinda, or i'll fix you as well!
so - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
never mind that. what's the story?
so, what? you're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
i know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
no.
you scared me.
does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
...ting the ruby slippers?
feels like a cigarette lighter.
oh please sod off.
really?
please. come inside.
... oh, yeah.  oh, yeah.
oh my god.
what the hell's there?
well...small world. well, then, you know firsthand how hollywood does things. lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
inside, they were talking of you.
we're not.
i was sent from the post in place of our social editor.
okay, i know what i want this time.
sorry you're gonna die -- cause i'm gonna make it.
a joker to the end.
mike!  the party starting!
we're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  we would give you a promissory note...
why so remote, addison? i should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
take her down to the car, and for christ's sake be careful this time.  last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  what a mess.  why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
if he's dead, verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york, wasn't it? tell me the truth.
it's beautiful.
-- i guess it's all got to do with this shop.
you rally think this'll draw the parent?
if you enjoy it, you should do it.
your ass? i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters.
but . . . how could you beat him?
barks at han.
yes.  i will.  it was nice to meet you officer jim.
this has nothing to do with me! she went up by herself. yeah i tell them don't go on the roof! they can't go on the roof!  how is she?
i didn't kill anybody.
yeah.
did you call anyone?  did you call her house to see if she got home?  did you call the masons?
i'm a blimp.
let's not start all over again, charlie.  we've said everything that can be said.
he's right.  these costumes are... missing something.  i can't put my finger on it --
not long at all, but i really like him.  okay, i know he's a little different, tucker, but that's what i like about him. he's a guy. a real guy. he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. and that's okay with me.
we're bringing in your wife...
i'm sorry i couldn't tell you the truth, but i had to find out your part in all this.
do you know about the chip?
you okay?
four of mr. hartman's deputy sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
good? good, paulie?! i've been treatin' you like a baby. since i can't remember it's so long -- i'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- that's what ya use to call me 'loser' -- what kind of name is that? so can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when i'm with rocky -- i don't owe you, paulie, you owe me.
singed a bit, were you?
eight o'clock tonight.
magua would use the ways of les francais and the yengeese...
what's the matter with you?
syndrome... chronic fatigue syndrome.
you're a man of science; i'm a man of god. charenton stands to profit from us both, i'm certain.
okay. i promise.
it's gettin' late. i think i'll pack it in.
i suppose...you think i should thank you.
i'm so inclined.
i wondered about your different accents.  i'm still wondering about your names -- rand and holland.
not just kids - - for everyone.  we're going to open next year.  unless the lawyers kill me first.  i don't care for lawyers.  you?
it's not your roof anymore.
what?
un-fucking-believable.  dick's out on a hot date, rob's boning marie lasalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
write her out a receipt, paine. give her a receipt for these letters too.
east coast people are different.
and what had you done?
the palace of the legion of honor. the art gallery.
i know it's soon to talk about it.

that still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
bunch of savages in this town.  hey, caitlin's in the back. you might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
it was the nicest thin i've done in a long time.
you sure it wasn't me?
if she calms down, i will let her in the house.
i don't think so.
dr. winkel? who is he?
i don't know about him -- i'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
listen, uh... hank and i think it best if you stay on shore.
i'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
i think we'd better discuss this in my office, mr. mitchell.
who'd steal her body?
forget the sub.
you mean you didn't. it seems to me the least you could do. you can't just jump at conclusions that way. you're being unfair.
for as long as you'll let me.
i don't know. but johnny, how did your mother recover? she was dying.
you've never been?
yes, i heard about poor warren. tragic.
yes, stop!  i wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  what's wrong?
you okay?
okay, okay. you're right.

oh, you know.  don't feel that much. bullet went right through.
yes, sir.
alright, take her out, ibanez.
can i ask you a question? why did you come here today? if you found this deed, why didn't you just ask eddie?
excuse me, but -- are you famous?
--no--
not so well, i regret to say.  this business with the maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  that's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
you want me to give up? let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
never saw him before in my life.  go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.

who?
rose, this is waski. his real name is warren but we call him waski. he doesn't like it much and i suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
i'm really sorry about last time.  he just flew in -- i had no idea -- in fact, i had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
who put you up to this? did my ex- wife ask you to...?
forty-seven.  you'd better floor it.
graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.

what do you mean?
you need to sleep.
you were talking about your wedding.
i saw my grandmother, of course, but i don't suppose that counts. i mean, she was alive at the time.

ooo, i'm sure mrs. caldwell will love that.
i was looking forward to seeing him.
yes.
it was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the earth -- but i was not allowed the opportunity. i have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  we know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. we also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
oh brad.
you shouldn't be here.
what are you going to do?
anything i can do for you?
yes. we're in danger here. every moment we stay.

i hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, mr. cluett.

no way. i can handle this.
just relax....
hey, doc, look. look, doc. gimme that again, will yuh? who's gonna get him?
what's he smoke in that?
what are they looking at?
but, missus, this is an emergency. it's a matter of life and death. me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
pension him off.
i believe in you a hundred percent, vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
hey. she says she loves you, nick.
then why, beth?  why go in?  why put out explosives?  why manifest the snakes?
i'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. if you've got something to say, lecktor, say it.
your lover.
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
i was getting to it.
it's her -- from the institute. if we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
what do you do in the joint besides pimp?
oh, no.
why?
yeah?
save it, baby. save it for mr. right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
you share it with over three million people every day.  you know that's the population of new zealand?  what's manhattan, thirteen miles long? that's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  read about this one guy.  gets on the subway and dies.  six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. think about that.  here's this corpse doing laps around manhattan courtesy of the new york transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. three million.  that's too damn many people.
is that it?
i have not said all. by malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friar's plan. he hears only that juliet is dead. and thus he goes to the apothecary.
and the questionnaire...?
we were young...  remember that little place on charles street we used to go to?
i heard something like that
i told you how early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
listen: i don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  you are her, you are rheya.
ready to engage computer, admiral.
and you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
no.
come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
one hour!
my family lives in miami. because of the death threats.
joe, be careful!
she's done it.
it's about the burglary.
for jefferson high. for books.
i will need a suite.
you said nothing. you told me nothing.
didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
not since we were kids.
a photon tube...!
you saying we go up there and kill everyone?
if you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
hello, i'm calling from...
i gave the other one to the sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> fbi.  this one's a fake.
yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through central park with the surgical masks on muttering.
dr. danielson, the man we want was never your patient. it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. please, doctor - time is eating us up. just show me the ones you've turned away.
uh-huh.
-- you got your shower --
oh yeah. the best. josie takes in the spectacle around her.
remembers what?
god, flash can be such a jerk.
can i ask you a personal question?
wyatt!  my god...
well, we have one lead and that's what i'm looking into next.
w-y-k no 'c.' i'll be down in a minute.
count of three?
it's nobody's fault, jack.  it's change -- which is a fact of history. even that old cocksucker hoover's dead.  things change.
did you believe in them too?
that wasn't necessary, buddy. i got this under control.
orson, you wanna take five?
because they're still here.
nothing.
isn't the plumage beautiful?
i know!
you were very upset.  you're always very upset in the dream, but i never knew it was you before.
i'll get the dress.
you're looking well, dutch.
don't mind mother.
beth, look, can i trust you with a little secret?
fuck you! you think i want this? that money's a burden to me. every day i wake up and i wish i could give that back. i'd give everything i have back to spend one more day with my father. but that's life. and i deal with it. so don't put that shit on me. you're the one that's afraid.
i don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
what is that thing? it serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of choppy crushy things in the middle of a catwalk!?.'
if she pisses you off, you get another one.
that you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  that it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
don't you, child?
you know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. a guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. and then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
look closely, eve, it's time you did. i am addison dewitt. i'm nobody's fool. least of all - yours.
who is it?
i just though you were awful cute.
i regret to inform you, sir, that saddam hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the gulf war.
fuck is that supposed to mean?
where is it?
i give it up 'cause i hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  shit, i sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
oh, brother, i am so disappointed in you. you mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
harry?
but thanks.
no.  maybe it was aubrey.
you son-of-a-bitch...
would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! sheriff buell clayton from texas.
what c-4...was cox talking about?
well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
you want the cake!?
any idea what he looks like?
no shit, kevin?
so, uh...i threw it out, but i have this other one.
i've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't i?
come back to my house. my car's outside.
three?
she should go home.
yeah.
get it out of here!
henry, the pen --
danny, listen up.  here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at cedars sinai medical lab.  they're getting a very special delivery a week from this friday.
i just think it might be important to explore your feelings for lila.
that's just plain silly. your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. it's no good, man. you gotta get out there. the ladies want to love you, baby.
pardon me, but i doubt you can handle her.  my wife was quite a martial arts expert.  jade fox killed her.  so you see, this is personal.  leave her to me.
no, you don't.
hi. i could give you a ride if you need.
your deeds set an example for all other knights. for your gift, ask a gift of me.
what's the password?
did we ever really think it was suicide?
i gave my key to the gate to todd, but the dudleys'll be here in the morning.
good night, oliver.
well, flea, i appreciate the respect you just showed me.  but i don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  it's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
you thought i sent them?
yeah.  jesus, you look like fucking royalty, tommy.
don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
i'm asking how you feel. does it bother you?
pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. for example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. you know the story, same thing here. same principle, i mean.
you'll still have the girl and the husband.
of course not.  only by a director of the firm.  who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
where did you get that?
yeah, it does.
now, amos, now--  what?
i could have you fired right now.
altar boys?
what's the matter?
oh, i have to hear this.
you're looking well.
i am better.
yes.
neither do i.
a runner... cathedral. a woman.
to a city with thousands and thousands of people.
i don't really understand the meaning of the words.
jeff--this is mr. taylor.
what will you do after the war?
do it again.
i'm a solid man.
i can manage.
yes?
oh, i love that.  i'm just great.  i'm so happy to be here. and i apologize for invading you.  and i'm so happy you asked me to.  i'm so touched.  i know how private you and sally are.
hey. what are you doing?
because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. so you care about what you're thought of in america. and in america, at this moment in time, hezbollah does not have a face.  that's why.
...where?
no thanks, i must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
this is the edge, boy.  this is the end.
you know, you never told me why you left the army.
well, i should probably get going.
he really believes jason's still alive, doesn't he?
a fire which never dies. burning one forever?
make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
i'm... i'm really proud of you, frances.
nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  you can do what you want, greer. but neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
it was a dream, star.
she shouldn't done it on "the number four with a smile."
ber dada!
keep them coming.
i've loved you all my life
i think i would like that drink.  i'll give you your christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
you make everything a fucking travesty!
get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side!
i had a bad heart.
not today.  she's learning her lines.  you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
well save room for mrs. matthews famous baked brisket.
i don't get it, you get a scholarship to nyu, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
what i'm thinking is, we can drop down through tennessee, across arkansas and into texas, from there it's a straight shot into california.  "we don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
yeah?
hmmm.
uh, you first.
i'm quite all right, thank you.
he's getting a break, ain't he? he's front page.
i want you to remember if you can a night last january. the night sister paul died. do you remember.
pause play.
eddie... it's one thing to compare clyde gruner to jesus christ. it's even okay to claim that shu kai kim is just slightly holier than the pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
i want to come back and stay here.
you know what my number one fantasy used to be?
yeah, okay. well, siddown then.  i'm carl showalter and this is my associate gaear grimsrud.
okay, friend. you're on.
what about it?
you're very tight, y'know?  right there.
i guess. it still sounds gross.
you got a bag or somethin?
i need to know where tyler is.  can't you help me?
uh-oh...
were you in love with him?
what's your name?
what does that mean?
i couldn't bear for it to end.
you're in a safe place, will.
tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
you don't know who the fuck--
"basically".
she seemed upset.
don't let 'em off the ground.
hey, watcha doing with that dog?
loves me!? she hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
who are you?
my orders are from com-sec intel -- b.l. willard, 4th recon --
i see, all right -- it's time for us to get out of this field.
caen?
keaton, we gotta go. they're gonna find him.
yeah, i have something i've been meaning to give you.
i don't like horror comics.
i teach this shit, i didn't say i knew how to do it.
i suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
why should we trust you ?
i want you to go on this trip.
no.  we're alone.
my plan is just beginning.  i'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but i'm afraid the birth of the new british empire can have no witnesses!
four years. girl, i'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
that's what everybody says.  only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... could you shoot eddie in the face?  at point blank range?
well, ain't that a shame. nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
you're welcome, will.
you dare criticize my father?!  or lecture me?!
well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
what are you doing?
grace!  just . . . let me handle this.  sheriff, i'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  if that's not good enough for you, then i'd be happy to open it.  just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
the question is why?  what was this chimera nekhorvich was carrying?
bomb?
i want to sleep... forever...
i taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
you're dead, you're fucking dead elias!
you want a partner?
i doubt friedman ever even met leon, deborah. friedman dealt with select customers. as for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles.
to get rid of this god-awful feeling.
he will be. simple inebriation, is all. the young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. you see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. came quite a distance to visit me, he added. his name's lewis.
here we are.  yeah, that's a possibility.  a movie.  now you gwan in, tell your mother i got you back on time.  point that out to her. she was always on my case for stuff like that.  she's still like that, right?
sam!  what happened!?  you had me scared to death.  are you all right?
can you? i'm happy being a dealer. at least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
call me please, patrick.
goodbye.
how'd you do it?
to relax.
we've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  it's out of control ...  you might burden just me with this in the future.
well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
hi.
-- yes --
five million dollars?
why'd you help me in the first place?
the money, the gear!
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude.  you saved my life.
was.  i'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  you got anything for me?
ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but i see tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and i'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case i just won't do anything.
people without cars.
you want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
go back to your room. quickly.
you should have heard him talk about you tonight.  like you were the hero in the china seas.
what time did you get in?
are they my kind louis? dolls never change either.
...you give us a ride in the cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in fairbanks in a few hours.
what choice is there?  if phillippe is in the bastille, then to the bastille we will go.
1 saw you lead our cavalry sir
parrtyy!
yes!
would you?
yeah, you do that huckleberry. i'll still be here.
let me ask you, why do you wear black ellen carter? what are you running from?
i wasn't too over the top?
you and he are not doing things?
getting there.
i didn't get any chicken.
surely, sit down. if i had known you were coming, i would have thrown you up a waffle.
if anyone ever spoke to me, the way i heard... the way she spoke to you, i don't think i could ever laugh again.
don't mind me, i'll just be in my room.
if you want.  but...
ray -- i'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
the two might go together.
why?
she's in a great deal of pain.
you are the boy ...
we might be innarested.
no.
yes. he went to mount vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
get a typist.  gettim a typist.  get outta here.
your line of work.  you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
was i? no... not by a bolshevik!
thirty-three here. totals one-ninety. not enough.
"war is not healthy for children and other living things." how lovely.
the day he died, eduard was called up to the castle.  did you know that?
this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  to me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
it’s give and take time, mr lombard. you need help, we need information. you didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
you can go get your stuff right now. i'll walk you down.
how was the funeral?
are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
it’s too late.
does that mean you don't like me?
just terrible?  that's better than yesterday at least.
did they catch...?
what are we standing on?
mr. scott...
tell that one, hollis--
i'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  can you remember the exact emotions when --
i don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  i don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  i just want to graduate from high school, go to europe, marry charlie sheen and die.  it may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but i think it's swell.  and then you come along...  and... and then i'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
so you've grasped the idea.  con- gratulations.  now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.
we had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
no....
why do you have dickie's rings?
ok.
he is.
isn't this just typical!  we finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
but dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
can i use your telephone? i want to talk to new york.
no, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
i don't remember.  one day he was just here....
oh god -- i can just imagine -- if only dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? never! i swear on your ring, marge. i am never going back.
i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one.
i left my forgery kit back at the office.
yeah, i'm here.
wait a minute.  how was lloyd?
i thought you meant...
let the buyer beware.
what number, on the first page?
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
victor, wait, slow down a second.  i want you to know i appreciate everything you've done for me, but i just don't --
i'm gonna quit.
we were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  me and the lads went down there sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the monday.  good job we were still breathing.
atrocious torture.  hit of the season, you want, i know a guy can get you a ticket.
the pleasure's all yours, officer gates.
maybe god's punishing us all...
the hell i did!
i need sleep. some of us are mere mortals.
so krueger thinks jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
what the hell is wrong with you?!
...and i said, shut up!
cole, my god, boy, what are you doing here? what happened?
me and mr. orange jumped in the car and mr. brown floored it. after that, i don't know what went down.
now you listen to me calvin webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
doesn't speak a word of english. and he won't speak japanese either. no papers.  the japanese embassy is very interested.
then leave.
no.
when does it break?
what about you?  what's in this for you, eugene?
but -- why?
you want the rest of those numbers, mr. dickson?
i don't think so boyd.
maybe i should come up with you.
why don't you just come clean, viktor?  tell the truth.  you'll feel better afterwards.
the fish.  check it....
if we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
why?
lex...lex, how could you do that to otis?
if someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
get off of me! stop it!
what are you thinking about?
i'm a criminal lawyer -- you think i like my clients? i can't stand most of them! but i don't kick them out...
the thing is, i'm responsible for the way he's acting. it's the nightmare juice. it's got to be.
must've read about the funeral.  sick mother.  that's the last thing you need right now, i'm sure.
believe it or not.  it's best for you to pretend that you do.  after all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  that makes you a party to murder.
do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
we're running out of time, sir.
did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? indicates no. moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
i don't know.
i don't understand...

you're going to say it, aren't you?
what are you doing at home on a friday night?
vada? would you like us to get you another goldfish?
that's a virtue isn't it?
what do you want, melvin?
and that's another thing.  you could lighten up a bit, yourself.  this severe routine is getting old.  smile once in a while.
in english.  i'll fuck your brains out.
let thy spirit
but it's damn irregular. no destination orders, no encoded i.d...
my fence in san francisco ... 305-4410.  maurice.  don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
but aramis -- !  phillippe can learn in time, but --
why?
don't let it get you down mrs. torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
hudson, don't you understand...
we're losing our favorite teacher.
voilà what?
...the next thing i did, i started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
it can only work with amateurs, a pro would have spotted it.
where the fuck are they going? to butcher a sheep? i thought this was a robbery.
because i was fucked up, man. i just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
it's time you found out.
ms. harvey... my name is taryn miles. i'm a criminal psychologist working for the fbi. i'm here to ask you a few questions.
about ready for another drink?
not yet.
you sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
i want the girl.  i don't care about the rest--but a us congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. we'll make headlines all over the world...
charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  the only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
it's you up on that stage, not him. you don't need him.
shhh.  you know what i hear?
yes.
enzo, wake up!
what value is that? you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past.
and that's why you never went pro?
what will i say when she comes to the door?
the law forbids it.
that's right! right now!
"beg to differ.  this casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
what others?
and this so-called . . . nuclear man. . . of yours can defeat superman?
i'll be very glad to show you around, miss...
take off your hat.
yes, sir.
so you found peter...
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the phantom zone.
what's wrong? am i doing something wrong?
he's alive!
visualize a spare?
oh - uh - nothing.
here's the best part.  we can charge five-hundred a pound.
i want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. i can't speak without notes. i like to have things down before me in black and white.
when it comes.
fine.
well, i can help.
don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
hang on. did you ever know a derek sommersby?
don't act so -- crazy.
i can feel my butt getting sore already.
not at first. you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. any second i thought you would take off and fly.
damn it, nuwanda.  you idiot.
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
quitting time.  grab a cold one?
we've met before, haven't we?
you must admit i have good taste.
nothing.
hope you're proud of yourself.
we know him.  he's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
that's it. and this figure --she traced it. the book i saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in march. mrs. redi had it out in april. no one else had read it since.
to protect his people.
what kind of shit is this? i was not on the team, i sparred with the olympic team... okay?
yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  think.  what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  he was on the phone. except that cable is a thousand feet long, norman.  they would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
did you see the way those girls drove off?  i did you a favor.
was it a butterfly?
now please, reggie -- cut it out.
is this your house?
it'll be more than that.
hello, thomas... i'm chance, the gardener.
did you say cops?
mrs. hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. you'll love my grandma rosa.
forget it, son.
thank you, herb.  you're a wonderful man.  you really are. everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the little league.
well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
i'm not your judge... nor have i any desire to witness the trial.
we're on to the game, ese. you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... it's all very cute. but come on, let's quit while you're ahead. i'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
no, no you're right, i'm sorry. he uses women; he lets them kill themselves. is that how you want it?
someone left the goddamn gate open.  otis got out.  skye and i, well the... i came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
mu bai, hold on.  give me some hope...
i'm fine.
you can call me sister.
i'm cold. i need to get out into the sunlight.
oh, you feel very good, betts. you have such a cosy body. i'm jealous, i'm so skinny.
she tells you you're ugly?
you done impressing yourself, ace?
sam!
ted!  what are you...?
joe, don't do this --
heather?
such a pretty day.  if i live to be 90 i'll never tire of mornings like this.  mind you i'm 74 now.
fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
when are they coming?
i will, miles. i will leave. but miles --
nice shot.
how bad are you, pal ?
what the hell is this?
what did goering say?
henri... i need one more favor from you.  i know i am imposing...
now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  we won't keep books.  go on, unpack mr. gillis' things.
oh, shit.
i feel sick.
kirsty cotton.  yes.  but ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
do you?  when i saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? i'm not so sure if america is as far from england as i'd hoped.
`cause you know i can do other stuff. i mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
don't know -- broussard got hurt somehow.
what?
that's right.  that's a good idea, mars.
how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
the pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
about the gale girl, i mean. where do we go from there? what of it?
mission accomplished.  well done, men.  pack it up, we're going home.
what?
it could have been anything, marty.
because it is my duty.
what are you serious?
what are you going to -- ?
go ahead! c'mon ... repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. name ...
don't cry, wee one.  it's a better place i go to.
oh, good. do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
you know i'll kill you when we're done.  i have to.
isn't it amazing! one gets a wrong impression of the new russia.  it must be charming. i'm glad conditions are so improved. i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
we're going to get in by studying imperial procedures?  i don't like it.
you're a good devil, dad.
if you think -
there he goes.  okay, gentlemen. are we ready to bring this man into the light? are we ready to truly do the work of the lord?
bad mood? i'm standing with the cast of "the godfather."
please. i look a mess.
nobody's hearing nothing!
an hour! or less!
pretty shallow of you.
yes.
there's old saying my mother told me. would you like to hear it?
okay?
i was in atlantic city with my family.  cliff was a waiter. he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier.  i've probably told you this a million times, but i don't care.  and then he held my hand.  i was scared.  all sorts of thing were going through my head.  but after a while i forgot about them.  at one point i looked down, at our hands, and i couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  and i knew.
i've no influence with mr. holland.
what kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
no, no, no, no.
did you call that radio station again?
why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
this morning, a lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  i explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
can you get it a little closer?
... gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. the scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american. but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... kinney, what did you come up with?
we're american soldiers.  we don't abandon people.
if they put this creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
what?
we're focusing.
you will or you'll be back at bet so quick you'll never know what hit you.  i need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  it will be on the fast track.
c-4?
that's it! we made it!
you're the shrink, you tell me.
there'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
basic equipment. you don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
what do you think?
i really should change.
i'm jack dawson.
murray said...
and it worked?
i saw the board.  you've got four...
no comment!
what are you doing here, where've you been?
it's been quite a night. i understand that your understudy - miss harrington - has given her notice.
i thought everything was checked out.
alright, i'll give you that. continue.
oh, i'm sorry. does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
yes.
two.
if i had seen you.  by the way i'm sorry about your wife.  they told me.
they'll be coming for laddie and me, won't they?
so shut up and keep painting..
inspector brimmer
if this is about del, forget it! i'm not coming back!
ned, i swear i knew nothing of this!
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  or it may not.
it shouldn't make any difference what happened.
right.
oh my goodness... bobby...
this is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
i'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
cancer-sucker.
i end the longest war in american history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  you know who's behind this, don't you -- it's teddy kennedy! he drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
we're clear.
suck me, beautiful!
i'm so sorry!
and i was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
beth --
try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
we're outa here. lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. this real estate's about to go buggy.
kate, you're still there?  i thought you'd be on your way home by now.
mr. dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
are you ready in there, feature attraction?
but that's the great thing about gold.  a little goes a long way.
mourning? who is dead, my lord?
me. ha! did i tell you i'll be eighty on saturday?
thought you were going to bring her.
schulz, you're off your nut!
... i don't understand it.  all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
nothing.  you'd think she was crazy.  and she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy momma's not.
hello, dwight.
what'd you do?
an abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. low rent, too. but, you and rice ruined their perfect hideout.
accidental?
that's what i'm askin'.
right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar --
why didn't you tell me this before?
we just cleared all four floors. no sign of him.
and living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
and on my time.
and roosters.
feels good.
how's my brother?
no, you wouldn't let me.  and i don't want to go...
sustained.  yes.  the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
i am sorry for you mr. james.  i'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  what are the odds, gentlemen, that i don't live to see mr. james hang yet?
i just don't want margo to miss her train. as it is, she'll barely make the theater...
how'd you get started?
shouldn't we be moving on?
to the airlift.
married? to anna?  you ain't got her in trouble?
i don't want the -
well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
so who's the lucky guy?
he can never know you as i know you... he can never touch you as i touch you.
yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
i... i gotta go.
some people got no respect for the dead.
well, could you lend me some money till you have one? then i'll teach her for free. that's a promise. oh, i'm sorry. i'm being silly. papa's right - i should put a padlock on my mouth. seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? only for six months, eight at most. after that i'll be the richest man in vienna. i'll pay you back double. anything. name your terms. i'm not joking. i'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over europe!
famous story even. straight burn. just an engine and truck first on scene. what did you feel, brian, when you first got there?
nothing. i dropped the soap. that's all.
if that little weasel ever walked in here i wouldn't serve him.
then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
i think i'll go for a walk.
so then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  especially the new papers -
...make some trips into the city. sometimes, overnight.
i'll have the usual trouble with annie in bed tonight. whatta i need this?
did it?
was his wife ever a suspect?
luke, use the force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
yes, sir.
but i've seen her grave.
monica... i was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- i mean you and i -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- i mean have a...
i'm a loser. and i'm drunk. but i'm not gutless.
excuse me for a minute.  ray, i'm right in the middle of something here.  can you come back in about an hour?
yes...
the tough part's almost over for you. i mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
okay, i just wanted to get your attention. my name is ray and my friend bucky and i design video systems. you've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
get him on the phone.
left behind?
is god merciless? greedy and cruel?
the mall?
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. my award winning exposé changed all that. the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
he's not registered. could he have gone to another hotel?
passion is something one cannot control!
you look swell in that three—alarm number --
i'm looking for maurice.
nero.
the nocturnal flying mammal?
i don't know.
cool, isn't it?  weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  on the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
it is not!
we don't operate like you kgb boys.
go!
how you doing, brewer?
man, that music is hot. what goes on down there, slim?
now... did you answer cause you thought that's what i wanted to hear or did you think about what i said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
kimball.
why didn't he make his move back there?
it's insane.
what i'm saying is, is that the king ain't gonna care. see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy, if you ask me i think he's jealous.
did you see anything in the files?
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
but it's my new tape.  my monday morning tape.  i made it last night just for today.
i don't know, but under no circumstances would i talk about it here.  i want you to go home and relax the best you can.  continue your life as if nothing has happened. that is very important.
of course he is.  freddy's dead and gone.
thank god your fever broke.  slowly, now. just a sip.  i've been worried we might lose you. it's been touch-and-go for a week.
whatever you say.
hi, dick. i'm alabama worley.
have you heard from judith's parents?
week or two.  musta been on the ker- osene.  stinks like a diesel engine.
you see that?
morton hull, the producer of 'this evening' just called.
skiing? 
no, i am appalled that i have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- i had to read about this in the tribune.
c'mon in.
what?
maxie's fucking with me. he put you with the spook to get under my skin.
my momma says every house is two houses. every street, two streets.  there's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  the city of the dead.
that goes double for me.
orson. stop. just stop
i won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
what do you want to know?
you sure got the hard part.
yes.
how many months are you?
susan, i really think -
i know that.  you think i don't know that? "i know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio.  on the other hand, maybe i'm just losing my mind."
lee...
don't you find that restful?... why didn't you come last night?
objection, your honor.  the answer is, to be generous, very vague.
for what it's worth, i'm sorry.
i made it work.
why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, mr. webster. there's this matter of little daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- i can't really talk about it, even to ma -- she puts it all on jabez and i won't stand for that.
funny old bird.
do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
i'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
why?
that's the deal.  if you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
i'll go take a look.
about what?
not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you, rog, but it's all i got, and...  ...all i got i share with you. go ahead. take all you want.
bert, now listen to me. ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? bert, listen!  it's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
the day walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? for lamagra's return. one need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "and the sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a tide of blood."
what’s he do anyway?
either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. he can't stay here.
i'm david hawthorne, this is my hospital. and my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  that was meant to be charming, sorry. i seem to have lost the knack.
tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  i seen a pitcher once. they was bones ever'place.
but -- you have to go out there! i'll give you more than your one third!  when i get paid... just take the fall!  you're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
call off the cat and i'll kill you, veidt.
you can't testify.
really? ballet?
...where does kyo live?
temperature's dropping.
i can't make it.  grace?  grace!?
keep my terms and i won't be your enemy.
what's this all about, connie?
what brings you back?
where'd she go?
i'll call you from detroit, baby.
look at those hands. those are the hands of an artist. a modern caravaggio.
hi!  macy struthers -- co-host on the f. f. show.
he just <u>appeared</u>.  you have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
what kind of coffee do you like?
who know?  we get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
i knew this would happen. soon as that piece of filth got out of pee dee, i knew there'd be trouble. he's just got some kind of influence over her i can't decipher. there's somethin' wild in lula i don't know where it comes from. you gotta find 'em, johnnie.
you dance splendidly.
curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
you and babe brother are so much alike...
why, so you can go after him?
suppose he had slipped us. what significance has that?
excuse me, sir...
think this is our guy?
you could always take it off.
well, i believe you when you say you go to school.
you're just jealous.
we can still take the offer, rod.
oh, nothing. but when you first came to casablanca, i thought --
okay.  just give me a second here.  i have to leave now but if you've got some time i'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
don't be fatuous, jeffrey.  little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
no. can't say that i have, richard. richard do you know why i'm here?
are you sure he's still lives here?
harry dunne.
without him. the guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
lotta rich women back there...
i'm from a small town too, you know.
mrs. williams? thanks for the cake.
oh, american, thank you. i like them.
pardon me, i've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
oh, yes.  you know ryan's been sober eight years.  and it's difficult if i... you know.  it's better if i don't.
i will follow you.
...i've got this lacrosse game.  it's really important, it's our last game. and you know, central almost beat us last time, so i really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at state, which means that after the game i might be able to stop by...
c'mon.  it's easy.  it's the same thing y'all do out at the yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  everybody go it?
peter lassiter...
i feel a song a comin' on.
that looked rather painful.
this all you want?
where?
an oversight, sir, i apologize. i felt i needed to get away for a day. the pressure. paid for my own ticket.
cover me!
larry mitchell found out.  so you killed him.
i want us to be together.  like people. honest, decent people.  in the eyes of god.  babe, today... i went to confession.
except for small eyes.
we pick up schumann.  sneak him back inside the beltway. and we plan his homecoming.  zt's gone be neil armstrong, dr. livingston, and <u>lindy</u>...they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...the pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "don't forget to vote..."
she took the baby in her arms?
are you going to keep it?
man, you really bummed me out. that's a terrible story.  nigger, you crying?
are you <u>real</u> mad?
how about you?  got a bar mitzvah this weekend?
i told you you could write, josie geller.
what's up?
you disappoint me.  i thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
who's heller?
do you like talk like that?
very nice.
yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
i worry because you don't.  it's my job. i'm feeling guilty.  i would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
shouldn't i be? you, on the other hand ...
well what am i gonna do with it?
okay. it's likely there are people in the union who don't want twombley to testify. they probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. i read that in the papers. what's his name, mel gordon?
it was windthorne. i knew it--what does that do to her love for ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place.  sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
what?
no, about scobie, i mean. i can't think of any reason why he was killed.
this is how you make dinosaurs?
look, rod, just get on the camel!
we're waiting for the jet car.  billy's bringing it.
grant wrote the song himself. i'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "eight is enough..."
david! david! i can't believe this!
what about when she identifies him?!
we never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
hello.
i think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
-- and she's dynamite!
if it was left up to me, i would poison him.
amazing.
you could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  she anything like your ex?
if they're not... we'd better get used to living in montana.
just keep your eye on the ball.
you used to be on the job?
how'd you get this number?
so spill it.  spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
plank road. yes sir. that's up a ways. mile, maybe.
i just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
oh, yeah. i got them thinking ordell's real nervous. they love thinking he's scared of them.
some people do it to be funny
you a pervert?
such language in front of a lady.
someone want to tell me what's going on--
don't they have lifejackets or something? an extra boat?
are you getting tired?
we need to do some tests...i'd like to ask you a few questions.
come on paulie, share the wealth. you copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
it's what you and rosanna named me. right?
yeah.  i'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
calvin wants me to move the white for tomorrow.
true.  but i must borrow it for one last mission.  jade fox must die at its edge.  did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
coffee?
why would the kid shoot at us?
but wudan does not accept women.
didn't principal jaffee call you?
...i'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
you're not funny. ouch!
it tastes bad.
i'm telling you they're probably friendly.
i'm alright.  but you can sit.
i thought you were supposed to be an expert.
cheers.
that scarecrow?  can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
i'm sorry, gallagher - really, i am sorry.
i thought she was a killer, too. you know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. there's always opening on one fleet or another.  fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. you gotta phone?
i was in the area, and i thought you might like to have lunch.
...sure.
this is ridiculous...
i don't know, i don't know.  i'm sorry - -
it's just medication, mister mcmurphy, good for you. now down it goes...
so... pretty nice house you've got here.
well, boo-fucking-hoo.
all those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
it's not locked.  i left it open when i took out jake's body.
they follow her because she's a --  -- no, i won't say that.
i threw up.
i was wondering. what if before the court date gets here, beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  i get my money back, don't i?
hi, daddy.
no. this war is almost over.
comrade kopalski...
i won't do it.
but you don't love me.
i'm afraid his car is gone, mrs. fortune.
your sexual orientation?
mrs. west is a very emotional woman.
what a surprise...
what's wrong with my face? you want to know what's wrong with my face? i've got a skin condition. next question, bob? no more questions? fine. now can you help me find the complaint?
joseph c. gillis?
where do you hail from?
it's ok.
he's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
you're right. i'm a little out of practice.  uh....that's an "s."
let me...
whatever! it's no dig on you, archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- the allemeinischer zeitung, le figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
you have no reason to feel ashamed. you haven't said anything you don't have a right to. and if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
-- so you shut them off?
love and happiness for ever.
ah, brenda ...  mrs. peel?
do? to who?
yes!  when i give the word -- throw the first switch!
according to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. we'll come up right between his legs.  oh my.
we're police officers.
daddy, where's my money?
exercising my visitation rights.
oh i don't know, i think the tests work pretty well. sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
you're being dense, major.  i certainly don't
the butler said i could stay. i told him it was important.
my name is camille -- camille johnson and i'm the supervisor of this school. what's your name?
just a minute. i'll pour you some coffee.
of course you will look mean, tom, you will look really scary.
i wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. it was just my rep, that's all. and don't shit me now, but did you have that number? tell me.
jesus, man ... what'd you do?
there.
oh huzzah, the master's home.
maybe you ought to read him pinocchio. you told me you were going to turn bluestar around. not upside down. you used me.
when were you all planning to tell me? a year from now?   after the election...  what's going on here? dave hesitates.
i was born, in new orleans, too-
to caitlin!!
naturally i think so.
reporters don't have hormones?
i never said...
jesus christ!  and you never told me?
look, someone gave her the baby.
look what the cat dragged in.
who else is left?
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
what?
you want a dressing bag, john?
how long we going to keep this up.
you new, kid?
it's too dangerous for--
no, almost never.
this is a gift you'll not return.
look, he's running after her.
actually, there's someone i want to meet ...
my first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
you can wear lifts.
the matrix?  yeah.
saturday, i have some things to do around the house.
i'll give it back to you ....  all i've got ....twenty-five thousand...
oh, shit ...
this ain't no game, miz lampert.
ok.
just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
bundt cake?
you like?
you oughtta read this hood, nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. check out the checkers speech stuff.
shut up and tell me.
... while children in africa and asia are napalmed and --
this is the opportunity of a lifetime. what are you? nuts? you've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
i've been backpacking.
nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
the <u>closet</u>?! have you lost all sense of reality?
hello.
right now?
you got the parole, didn't you?
till they kill you. yeah.
shoot.
my god!  look!
snoopy?  i love snoopy.
please. i'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. i just need you be right there to arrest him. okay?
we can reach an understanding on this.
you're as crazy as he is! he's right! you don't give a damn about saving lives at all! fuck you!
bobby?  what the hell's the matter with you?
again? good idea.
in a word, bob...
i messed up, okay, i know that.  but i ain't that kid's father.
have you talked to carlos about your concerns?
says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
feeling lucky today, miles. found a penny -- heads up. there was an empty cab right outside my building. we hit every green light.
where are you?
i'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
it's so beautiful.  it's just what i would have picked out if i'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  you see what i mean.  there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but i am not one of them.  surprises are highly overrated.
you're saying that i've halo'd innocent people?
it's terrible -- you just made it up.
you said i had delusions -- that i created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
where did you get that alcohol?
oh, he does!
this doesn't make sense.
...look, lieutenant...uh, vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
gale he's got dewey!
we're in a shootout, roy! shut up about the damn fish!
you don't have to finish tonight.
what's the point?  look at me.
i see.
so mitchell had handled it. afterwards, brandon picked it up.  there's no indication you handled it.
you seem to like movies, detective.
you kids go to bed on time! you've got school tomorrow!
you guys are playing music?
who are these guys?
i'm sorry, jimmy.  but with this movie and two difficult stars --
i know.
who was that?
look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little od won't surprise anybody. it's the only way we can be together.  you know it's true.
how!
when he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  but today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. do you follow me, major?
you shouldn't smoke.
that kind with the garlic and the oil that i like so much?
what the fuck're you talking about? that poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, dude.  you said so yourself--
... i understand ...
i don't know what happened.

oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. we were fortunate that mr. gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
where did you get this?
well,  what seems to be the trouble?
could you concentrate for five seconds?
no, cole, i...
they put up *their* candidate? who?
who's miss johnson?
i'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
he's weird.
joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  you bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
don't drop the guitar, man.
remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
they're the scoleri brothers.  i tried them for murder.  they were electrocuted up at ossining in '48.  now they want to kill me.
what do you know about me?
i was thinking, i have to go up to boston for the aap convention and then visit winston-hughes about switching over our computers.  why don't we meet in new york for valentine's day weekend?
i don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. private school, harvard, and now med. school.  i actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. i shouldn't have told you that...
what do i have to do to stop it?
what took you so long?
what's this about?  because we <u>fought</u>?
it's fucked up.  i'm sorry...
yes, ma'am...
may i help you?
you wanted to let sonny handle it.  i would've moved in when we first found out.
i -- i mean it's all right. it doesn't matter.  i'm -- my name is andrews, charlie andrews. i've come from india -- i've read a great deal about you.
gee. but --
you want me to take over?
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." the crew is dead, dr. weir. this ship killed them. and now it's killing us.
nine.
yes?  hello, mr. mayor.  nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  it's the mayor, he's saying...
i don't think so.
geez, i forgot how heavy these things are.
it's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
i know.
where's your phone? i have to call another taxi.
who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
why would they exaggerate?
do you want to hear my list of english kings and queens?
no?
thank you.
where does he live.
get out of the car.
that's better than yesterday.
will you do something for me?
what?
you guys -- i can't. we're in the middle of a trial.
hey, house is doin' well.  hey, all that money is rollin' in. i appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
what are the chances busting out of here?
what the hell did you think you were doing?
yeah, dummy.  money.
i don't think you should...
i'm telling you. wait three days...
well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  beth started talking.
i'm gonna miss you.
i know you do. i love you too, annie.  and you're right. we are meant to be together. and i know we must die. but it must be so that misery can live. we have the power to give misery eternal life. we must finish the book.
what's the worst thing you ever did?
you're a hell of a flyer.  you can be my wingman any time.
to the bathroom.  can i do that alone or do you want to watch?
yes, it just shows—  i don't know why i'm talking to you. i don't know you. who are you?
nice night out...
bullshit, dad.  don't front me.  for once.  just tell me the truth.  i came from there, too.
where's your car? i'll walk you to it.
and i was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
was someone in an accident?
even i'm not that crazy.
newmeat looks like a poker player, drag.
nope.
i'm asking you seriously, sarah, a stranger?
yeah. johnny friendly and my brother had other ideas.
well, a tall handsome ubangi, i suppose.
no thank you.
i don't know if the fu-cang-long paid you to get rid of tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  i don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
you know, burke, i don't know which species is worse.  you don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
no, i had a dream about daddy.  do you think i'll ever meet anyone like him?
because becker resigned after the charges brought against him by state patient advocacy groups.
propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
now, my flower, do you understand?
captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
i'm sure that's it. 
nothin'! i want nothin' from you!!!
have a drink.
gin's okay.
ian, you're not insane!  i'm so glad!
sure, an' i'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the champ. he's just there to help condition the man.
that's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  when do you think you'll need me for real work?
she is a wild, twisted bitch.  stay away from that one.
where are the sand-cat tracks? why aren't we still following them?
he was your patient, doctor. if the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
well, i wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
that's your "rep."
'the owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
jill, say hello to felicia.
...protect your sources...! you screwed me! you sold me out!
what are you going to do?
the forager's back.
it would be better if he called us.
you scum!  you sick filth!... you did that to her!
cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  nobody wants to go.
this is it. i'm in hell. damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
okay, have we gone over everything? back on tuesday, right?
yeah, bandit ii, que pasa?
harry d'amour.
professor tripp?
what would your mother say to that?
you mean he was colored?
susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  but in her heart of hearts i imagine, dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. now, what about you, son?  not just tom-catting around...i hope?
war it is.
yes, i've got it.  don't you think we'd better destroy it? so it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
cancoon.
i can't leave now.  don't ask me to explain!  i just can't!
aren't you gonna answer that?
i'm sorry --
you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism.
why, i turned them down, naturally.
the world is a big, beautiful place.  we can open new markets in africa and asia.  imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine.
yah, how much money was that?
darling...
in here.
i would like to change your name.
cool pictures.  you a fan?
my father's guilty.  he lied to me, he lied to everybody.  i just left home... i need you.
well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
is that the truth?
iris.
how sad --
so, um, pony, where are you staying? are you staying at your mother's house?
your impression is very reassuring, brother. of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but i sensed that was that the girl was like and i'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
get over!  get over!
you've...
could be ten or fifteen.  maybe even twenty.
where are thomas and fedens?
don't curse.
twicet now i've fell for that line. maybe he needs a thousan' men. so he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. an' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'f he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. ast to see his license. he ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
they were talking about the vrykolakas this morning. cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
somebody has to.
i don't reckon.
how did she die?  i wanna know.
you bet your ass he will.
sure a lot of guys lookin' for lednov.
verona's summer hath not such a flower.
like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
let's go.
lie down!
you won't keep growing at this rate.
about dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>raoul</u>?
everybody says you were a grand detective.
you don't wanna move, do you?
i worry about you.
west?
don't tell me he's "busy".  i asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
guess who?
careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
mmmmmmmmm.
looks familiar?
spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
you're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
i'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
oh.
no!... yes, a little. you see hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
john, i know all about it.
at times, yes. but that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. actually, i found him to have quite a sense of humor.
well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  when you leaving?
sull!  what the hell!
wet behind the ears.
no.
napalm.
you know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol i once owned. a beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
come, come, come, georgie boy. you're a big strong chelloveck like us all. we're not little children, are we, georgie boy? what, then, didst thou in thy mind have? confrontation. georgie backs down.
yes -- yes -- i am tired. i have been ill...
yeah. i mean, i don't think about it all the time. but once in awhile i kind of go, woah. man.
what's that?
it's the same prevision.
you know, talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. you spend too much time up here.
whatcha doin'?
you're political, then?
he thought, perhaps, your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
i'm a boy - i'm a boy - i wish i were dead - i'm a boy - i'm a boy -  what am i going to do about my engagement present?
inspector halloran.  homicide. you were supposed to contact a peter kurten?
excuse me!
this has to be a big mistake.
what the hell is it?
i'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
and sacrifice han and leia?
popup, on floorboards. and--
you're missing the game for us?!
azrael can you repeat that?
right.  raymond... a priest.
the pentagon?
no.
i've got it.  it's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
let you leave without it.
they're just doing what they do.  well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
it has been three weeks since i "fired" her. is there no way to get rid of this girl? are we stuck with her for life?
if i'm anything like you, i'll deserve him.
why are you suddenly so mad at me?
i listen on the radio. i can see the games just fine that way.  the world is in your head, remember?
no goodbyes, elaine.  just go.
it should be... it's yours.  i want our debt forgiven.  i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states.  and i want the principle witness against my husband, eduardo ruiz, killed.
oh, do yuh?
kim?
you hit me.
i got a hit on the car.  an oh-five tahoe, blue, with wyoming tags... agt349... it wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
kid, get outta the way!!
i've never seen you here before.
really...? so what?
are you alright?
i'm running away.
so... that's it?
i would advise you not to interfere.
no, thank you.
captain, if your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset!
what does it look like?
but i love you!
earth to richie. don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it.
female.
which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, mr. president. we're tracking 26 ships inbound to cuba. there's no sign they're changing course. the closest ships, the gagarin and the kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
it's -- beautiful. may i inquire as to the occasion?
michael...
sure, after a fashion.
couldn't we work in the evenings? six o'clock in the morning? this next month i'm completely at your disposal.  artie is out of town.
yes, i have.
no, mickey, i can't let you get away with that shit. answer the question. was it worth it? you haven't seen, heard, or smelled mallory in a year. was it worth it?
for two years, i've been tracking the mayflowers' peculiar interest in three da vinci pieces.  their sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
i don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  is that clear?  is that clear!
.          .. spock's tube...
-- stephen, this is bullshit --
the name?
um. you're doing all right.
leave him alone, ma--al's just billy- goatin' around--
he had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
i know it well.
wait, betty... you still haven't answered me.
he was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
i'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  who should i tell him called?
son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. my hand is too weak. and would you do me another favor? i don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? i have trouble bending over.
i can't be nice to a fan?
stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
me, sir?
master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
nothing for ladd?
not yet.
no, no! give it to me!
there's no such thing as a psychic. people believe my folderol because i wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
are you kidding, josie? it's lame. all they do is stand around and get drunk. it's lame.
it is you junior!
no. i think his widow's still in their place in darktown, though.  you think it's charley wade, huh?
so? i heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
i'm up twelve grand today.
yes, sergeant?
i won't have another mate like ona.  you rate very high in sanitation.  i've checked.  in fact, i am surprised that you were ever matched with luh.  her ratings are very erratic - you know what i mean.  we'll be happy.
in your opinion.
i'm glad you're here.
they send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. each shell costs as much as a ford 8.
will - uh - five thousand be enough?
where is it?
what is that?
yes, baron.
i'm sorry.  well, we need the money. now we have it.
john died.
jonathan was such a beautiful man. no one knew him like i did... excuse me.  i can't do this now. i'll call you tomorrow.
but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did?
but you were in on it -- you worked for him.
the door jam, miss teschmacher. this ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. so he grabs something from the table...
yeah, you're alright.  but you're certainly not happy.  so what happens if you get happy?  and yes i know that's the title of an elvis costello album, i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. should we split up because i'm used to you being miserable?  what happens if you, i don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? time for a new girlfriend?
no, i want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until i get back.
maybe i can help?
what you get from renting to bachelors. all night i didn't sleep ten minutes -- and i'm sure you woke up dr. dreyfuss.
thanks.
we gotta call the police –
that man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
eighteen.
they just landed in the desert.
you look wonderful. i'm on top of the world tonight, lila. work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
if you're waiting for "do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
there's just one more thing.
your honor, since rockwell corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
...so?
do you think anyone can see us down here?
it was?  i didn't...know.
it's okay. it's a cop hangout.
thirty-two and change.
could you have your partner wait for us outside?
i know it sounds crazy, but i went to this rekall place after work, and...
sid, give her back!  give her back now!  i'm telling!
it's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. you understand that?
look, baby - i don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. i just know it is. so, what d'you say?
i was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  take a look for yourself.
being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. that is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
...i'd just start my own business. that's what i did. get into kid porn. that's big now. why don't you come around the set? meet some people. if you still want to invest, i'll ask around.
you guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... it's just a shark.  a great big bloody wonderful shark.  don't say anything to anyone. the locals find out they'll panic. they'll want to kill it.  we've got us a great white, michael. we're going to do us some real research....
hell of an assistant, isn't he?  damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
so what? there's other women!
i'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. what's his name?
well, i mean, i meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
give me a drag.
are you jorge cruz?
i want that fucking radio!
a lot of reasons. but the main one would be i'm tired of it.
why?
i know.
johnny, wait...
her car is gone.
excuse me.
help you.
it's weird. i actually feel good about myself. can we do this again next week?
why? 'cause i... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? that's not following!
do you mind if i borrow it?
what's the matter, everything all right at home?  mila's okay?
jack, she's innocent!
you'll learn.
yes, sir.
about a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
the car accident? any of this ringing a bell?
first he's gonna shit. and then he's gonna kill us.
invitation, please.
that's it.
all right, if it'll make you happy, i'll try that.
well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
mr. stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
you missed fourth amendment law. unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. where were you all afternoon?
of course you do.  a tuxedo and tails.
and she'll fight back again.  god help me, what have i done.
early, what're you doin'?
we made it!
well, one must do something to live, you know -- and i have an elderly mother who depends on me.
that's it?  no number, or instructions?
the laws of god are higher than the laws of man.
my wife.
the play's going to be really good.
you don't, you can't believe that ...
you better come help me.
okay, okay.  i suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by colonel mustard, with the knife.
hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what i need is not the...what do you need...?
what do i *mean*, huh? uh--*i'll* tell ya--world's series--a pass! in a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
all right, kent. i just hope you know what you're doing. if you really think smallville is your big chance, go for it.
gallagher! she's the real mccoy!
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon.  i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank's place.
that's it?
this man down at the drugstore...
he hardly knew of them him- self.  i believe it was his uncle in australia.
don't want to be critical, john, but here it is—
twenty bucks?
what's up, walter?
you're freaking out here man.
yeah, he's told me. burnfield. we all hear about burnfield.
and sanctuary?
our destruction?  who?
you killed her!
i love it.
it was just a soldier. i was trying to punch his major in the eye.
doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
you know, general kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of rostopchin's secret police.
you have one of these?
i can't believe this.  i'm in fucking russia, or do i have to say, the fucking soviet union and i'm shooting a non-bolshevick.  i never thought i'd say "i'm just in this job for the money."  sad. any last immature quips?
but from now on it's lucky's spot.
tony and i have to talk some business, first.
jake, i'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
get your hands off of her.
yeah, i've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  right?  and sam.  believe me, suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  he's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  stay strong and he can't do shit.
forget it, man.  it's not worth it.
ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
you're just going to lock the store like that?
yeah.  are you sure?
can i... can i t-t-talk to you?
i can waitress. i'm good.
where is he now, sir?
dude, somebody's on the rag.
it couldn't have come from anywhere else. at least, somewhere from that vicinity... but i really can't understand it. contraband cigarettes on that island! it's the first time that ever happened.
sorry?
i fucked her! okay? i fucked her. i'm sorry. but that's what the hell i did.
if we surrender, and i return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
buggin' out, i gotta work here.
twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and casanova was their king.
there's this native broad works in the laundry. i don't know if you've noticed.
look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
no, no. she said not to call, her husband might answer.
why don't you ask him first?  maybe he'll say yes.
she was seen leaving town in her car. seen by her very victims, i might add.
what are the chevalier's intentions?
he was re—enacting charles manson's labianca murders.
you can and you will!!
oh, i know, i know... it looks awfully bad.  it's really embarrassing.  but it was bob's idea.
the falkner sisters are rather timid, your honor, and wish to be together. if the court pleases, i will only have one of them testify.
okay?
surprised?
absolutely correct.
pull them back, d'artagnan.
where's dad?
tell us about it.
pardon me?
who's gonna outfit us?
it's okay. i'll make it up.  i promise. just hurry it up a little. okay?
me??
i thought we all had separate rooms.
so, you're just kind of a roving --
i know you do. but it is different.  it's different.  we'll be all right tomorrow.
i'm sorry, michael.  senator geary's here, and mr. and mrs. barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  won't you join us, mr. ola?
look, can i just call a cab?
i have an apartment. i don't remember exactly where. my dog knows, though.
he's drunk.
gee, thoughts! alla time thoughts!  you really believe that drool?
because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
four-thirty in the morning?
at a guess... they just resurrected him.
that's its name. a pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
you still there?
me?  i've never been better. i mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
for me...?
here's the picasso. is he in his room?
it's 350 pages long.
easy, pal! i was coming to congratulate you. it ain't easy snatching one of those e-tickets. steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
what would the poster say: "narcissus would kill for a taste of golden pompeii olive oil?"
what shall we do?
oh, that's too bad.  don't you think the wizard could help him, too?
what were you doing there?
what'd be the point? not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead negro's grief. we lucky our ghost is a baby. my husband spirit come back? or yours? don't talk to me! ha..you lucky. you got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. be thankful. i had eight. eight with six fathers. every one of them gone from me. four taken, four chased and all, i expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. my first born - alls i can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. her little hands..i wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. can you beat that? eight children and that's all i remember.
what?
he'll still be your son-in-law!
well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
could be worse.  i don't know how, but i'm sure it could.
good. it's better if it were absurd. that would mean nothing much can be done about it.
enerao, i've host them. the maanetlsm o: the field is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. there they are
it's against the rules. dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
you know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
i don't take kindly to you and falco selling me ethics.  who's the injured party here, you?
i just want you there in case there's trouble.
where you going?
in the tar??
i was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the patient, hardy: they're everything that's good about england. i couldn't even say what that was. we didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - i mean -  and us - he never once… he didn't ask me if i could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - i don't even know what i'm talking about.
alright, good.  thanks for your trouble. so will you leave sally and me alone right now?
maybe i should put on the training whe---
we have a lot in common.
and what did you do?
i remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor annette married." except her brother. you treated me with respect.  look, you paid your dues. your slate is clean now.
they don't expect to get what they're asking.  let's make an offer.
can i do it again tonight?
frankie opens them with his teeth.
oh, come on, we're not children.  i didn't have anything to do with this fidelity nonsense and you know it.
hold on a second!
"we"?
why?
i almost forgot....
think she'll hold?
did he ever get rough with you?
jobs doing what?
hmm?
yes, so do i. but i think he is a little... old-fashioned. like a puff, harold?
i've considered that possibility.
no, no, no! i disagree with you absolutely. that's the trouble with you artillery men.
what's that?
you took the time to pay the saleswoman.
fine. everything's goin' good.
i thought maybe you forgot...
i have some ideas.
what did you think?
they should go one truck at a time. when the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
goodnight.
she finds him.
sir, i want you to know that i had nothing to do with any of this.  not this article, not --
no!
that's not our intent --
you were a great scientist once. don't squander your genius on evil.
are you klingman?
love gives you wings.  it makes you fly.  i don't even call it love.  i call it geronimo.
it was sure nice of uncle sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on earth.
like what?
have you ever done any cloudbusting? you lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. it's wild.
carrie.
hell yes, i like it. what's better than this? most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
friends call me otis - sometimes tricky otis.
oh that? just mulling over business problems. examining opportunities...exchanging rumors... spreading gossip.
did you hear what i just said -- do you have that?  take a breath.
that's not true! whatever problems your father and i are having, have nothing to do with this.
no baby.  i'm serious.  cancel that meeting.  i got more fruit that needs checking.  come home with me now.
look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. just take it!
aha!  he has a brilliant military record, i'm sure.
oh, you see an analyst?
they're from good stock on their mother's side.
i don't know what you're talking about.
obviously you don't think so, and i don't know why.
oh, there you are, mister turkle.
you wouldn't believe this, walter, but bruce holds the door open for me.
we was robbed.
go onto the next question.
come on, linda, i haven't had a boyfriend all summer. you promised when i started working at the mall that my life would change... do you think he'll call this week?
you should be more careful, anna.
with coconuts?
your majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as ambassador.  but i would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the emperor, if i did not say that it is entirely possible that the emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the treaty of tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a french alliance for an english one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
goddamnit, harry.  this is our butts.  so your life is in the toilet.  so your wife is banging a used car salesman.  sure it's humiliating.  but be a man here--
they would have killed you -
i will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  meanwhile... i'm going to compiegne.
the powwow safe?
why?
there are two doors to your house. a front door and a back one. if you answer correctly -- you live.
i've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine jessica well again -- wondering what i'd feel. i could see jessica as she used to be, i could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "paul, darling..."  the whole thing beginning all over again...
dr. jaffe has pinned her ears back.
nobody move.
i don't like dancing.
he's...i'm sorry...so sorry...i've seen this before, you know and you don't.... he's going very fast....frank...um....
someone's been doing all these things.
do you have a sword?
don't be defensive.
go ahead.  ladies first.
hi.  lloyd dobler, sir.  pleasure to meet you.
kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
dammit, beavis, i was about to score. huh huh.
walker and williams.
yeah, i like that!  where you go, i follow.
shot in the back. i was there. i can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
oh, i have some suntan lotion.
but if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
your breasts feel larger.
it's yourself you've got to be proud of, huckleberry, how much ya need?
guess i'll just keep working.
he's gotta know by now that i gave him up back at glades.  he does, he's gonna try to find me.  maybe go see adele, see what she knows.
i said say that again, son - because the next time you do, i'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
if anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
take...
kathryn, i know all about you and sebastian.
oh yeah?
he used to know me.
you can't be serious.  it would not be good to become another husband out of a moliere farce.
well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  you see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him nessie ... they'll be dead, the reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. tea! 
you want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for captain naramunju.
that's okay. maybe it is. my mother always says -- "everything that's wrong with you is in your head." i suppose that's true.
i started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
no.  i'm quite certain you can't.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, al.  i got soft.  you know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
that's nice. all we have is a japanese beetle trap.
maybe she needs help, ted. you should be a gentleman.
you're kidding.
considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, i'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
i want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  they're going to say that you enticed marsh -- led him down a dark path.
why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? why didn't you tell me you could read?
dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! he is not to be given food, water, or clothes! if he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
that's why i need your help.  you said you were good.
it's enough isn't it?
what, justin, what shows you?
he already knows everything about what he can't do.  you can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
it's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
[there was no ten million dollars.]
i just wanted to relieve your mind. your father's alive and all right.
you go. i'm staying with it.
... showers followed by sunny periods.
sure.
mine's the eleventh.
...hit smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, mr. president.
you've heard enough.  decide. are you going to release me?
you gotta be kidding?  he's a human chum line!
rumors? rumors? since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
you're coming, aren't you...?
may i ask what has happened?
go then. i can't let you put it in me now but i want you. i like you.
they're letting me have this vacation. which is why the get-up. which is why you haven't heard from me.
donnie darko is a cool name. sounds like a superhero.
i'll see you there.
central services don't take kindly to sabotage!
poppa joe said there was only two. in and out.  boy, you guys sure did a good job. you're good, huh? cool masks. where'd you get them?
hey, hey, hey. i think somebody's got some new clothes.
can i help you?  russ yelburton, deputy chief in the department.
well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
you son of a bitch. she's been here.
how come?
at this moment, i feel no love for you at all.  i never thought that could happen, but it has.
she's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
eat up, book. what's the matter with your appetite?
bruise?  oh, yes. it's better.
call me later.
father, by creating a little destruction, i am, in fact, encouraging life!  so, in reality, you and i are in the same business!
i knew it. i told him.
is there any way around?
manray was under our nose the whole time.
well, close the fucking door by all means.  but don't expect me to go down there and do it.
give me ruben back...
well... it's just a condo really. right outside katmandu.
you're going to take me back?
how do you like my hair?
yes, sir.
no.
the key?
try to act cool, okay?  he's gonna think you're a dick.
you say i am a crook.
eh --
i see.  well, i guess we don't have much to say to each other.
did you read her mind ?
did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
hat was this morning.
no.  i thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
what's your name, boy?
happy to meet you, mrs. rilke.
look. i'm serious. it's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
it's like, you looked at my tape. you saw my picture. why did you call me in? you knew i was twenty-four.
people have worked this whole big thing up around my father. if it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. now i understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
no, you're safe --
thanks, sweetheart.
you're welcome.
you think i have a problem?
why memphis?
claudia - don't -
nor to elizabeth.
what do you want it for?
what gives?
there's still something wrong with it... take out "president" ...now what've you got?
we're going with you. i mean, we're going too.
oh god... what did we do?
i don't suppose i can go back to the university and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
what do you want me to tell you, monica, to go beat that girl up?  to go have sex with him?  i'm not going to do that. yes, i believe thinking of other people is important and yes i'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  if that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
gentlemen.  i think we've calmed down now.  haven't we, jack?
heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, hoover blackballed their memory. look at ness.
i never know when you're telling me the truth.
fine.  while i retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  she's frozen in -
a wiseguy. paying 100 grand for the rapists if i turn then over direct to him.
it's gonna be fine, orson. you're gonna do great.
which one?
why are you here now?
he's looking down.  and he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  he's proud of the man you are tonight.  that's what counts.
i was captain of the wrestling team at lehigh university.
your father had a stroke. he's upstairs with your mom and dr. bennett.
and his parents?
the deflector shields are gone.
play back the last line...
oh?
those are suzie toller's teeth.
feral? don't touch him! he might be diseased! he might... my god, rabies!
what?
no, it's impossible... no one, and i mean no one would venture anywhere near the alderaan system... i'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  you're aboard the wrong ship, son!
then you'll be glad to know the university has decided not to press criminal charges against you. breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
yes?
what lousy luck--i mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
well, i keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. i mean, what hell's goin' on? what are we doin' over here?
did i kill my mother?
i don't know.
i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut --
no thank you.
no.
what happened?
i don't know what i was thinking, but i can't do it.
i've been making friends with your cat.  is it okay that i'm here?
since i'm a kid, i had this dream... i want to own my own tropical island... beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
arenít you going to thank me jim.  ten million is better than six.
and as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
hey, joe...good.  you know b...
no, you don't! walter!
hi.
yes ...  make sure ...
i thought we were going to take it easy until the mission...
jesus --
a raft.
client?  i like to think of myself as more of a friend.  a mentor.
it's stupid, of course.
what'd you do?  tail me from brentwood?
theodore herzel.
the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
did his parents attend to that?
and you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
what am i, five?
what are ya, deaf?  turn around!
it's a real privilege, sandman.
annie's there. she'll be all right.
i bet the view looks better from the worthin'tons'.
253... 254... 255. i get the same as you jim. looks like paul's our president.
yeah!
sorry. it's just so bad lately. you're so lucky you never get pms.
who'll make the rules?
do you have a boyfriend?
yes, your honor.
ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. they're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when i leave to manage the new store. i'm sorry.
those are my clothes.
pardon?
oh -- marty -- what time did you say it was?
i don't know, the screens are dead...!
well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
but tell me why ...
big fuckin' deal.
it wasn't like that.
i'm not a fool! and i'm not capable of being fooled! not even by women!
bank branch!
screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
well, thank you...?
oh, happy!  dick nixon ... you remember him.
i would like to get paid now.
i've been looking at motorcycles.
i don't own a television.
this is horse?
please don't scream at me. i like you, but i don't like the way your attitude is.
thank you, sir.
he's got the shakes?
there's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
how long has it been?
i didn't do anything.
no i.d. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
what for?
who lost a shoe?  wash your hands.
see that girl? that's jacqueline's sister. it's because of her i ask.
i could have given you the world.
they are not my clients.
that's okay, unc.  i can't swim, either.
yes?
i got a big score lined up up north. they wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  i could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in january--
here?
check.
where did it come from, mama?
you're a week early.
i'm looking for sid.
okay, peaches, okay.  but can i ask you one thing?
how could you do this to me tonight? i told you i had company
see you downtown.
yes!
i don't know.  someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'dear rufus -- you belong in jail.'
stanley.  stanley... you knew the... stanley.  you knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
i won't forget.
frances, you're still filled with anxiety. you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. consequently, i didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
you know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
dan -- what do we do now?
leave me alone, jude.
any psychiatric medication?
is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
this time...
yes, you can.
are you aware that lateesha rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you?
i don't think so.  i think we were meant to think it was mbwun.  did whittlesley's monster have claws?
god!  how old are you?  there ain't no bat.
fine..
no.
we ain't taking him to a hospital.
tell it to the ones that did this to me.
you are naive. look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  not that i don't miss you.
it killed her.  it ate her.
then how'd you hear it, fool?
i need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
you're not losing trust, are you?
what are you talking about?
what was the motive?
breaking out
you don't look half-bad.
com'on, just say it. try it on for size.
this fucking job's getting to you. you haven't written a fucking word since you started.
oh sweetheart! what was i thinking? mommy is never gonna let you go. oh jesus... never, ever, never let you go.
i know, but--
yes, sir -
you see what i'm sayin'? you control the space.
dude, i'm not supposed to make calls--
these two fucking scenes are related. too many coincidences. same day? five hours apart? dead mobsters on both scenes. now, why did he kill the bartender?
no.  i think it's just right.
frank, we need to talk...
"i have these uh..." she explains to you... "when i was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." like... i don't know the word. like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
i heard your friend was back in the hospital.
forgive me, caesar, but do two senator represent the mood of the whole senate or the will of the roman people?  besides, every truce we make with the germans they break!
this is yours...
he thinks he is. he says his mother was apache, but i suspect he's lying.
big berthas, shelling france. twenty-five-mile range, they have.
wait a minute, boys. happy may have hit on something tremendous here. rather than let miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. he's completely out of the way in washington, and as happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
did she know where nix was buried?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
i, uh, know a guy at the power company.
no.
what's that you're saying?
could i ask you to move?  i'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, i can't really bear the sheets moving over me. sorry.
the colonel saw you shoot nunez, you're a murderer --
it's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
we were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
perhaps it was. i was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
we are emissaries of her majesty, queen cherlindrea, of the land of coshairm.
what's he going to pull--
you get her?  okay.  well, i need a lot. i need more than usual.
it's modern. it's up-to-date. it's state-of-the art.  people, i am in love with this machine.  go ahead, mr. white.
but what about the other night? we were like two stars in the same constellation.
what...is...it?
good morning.
...i don't know what you mean....
i thought i told you to stay away from her.
i'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  you tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from maxies.  you and coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  if he hadn't been a numbers runner for doyle lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
you were supposed to be this colossus. you were this great, legendary thing. and yet he gains.
someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
now, ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
whoever that is.
i just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'she stole the money.' 'we don't want to get her in trouble.' 'no don't bring the police in'...
you talk as if this thing's already been decided.
grapple, biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, pocket fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. gee stud, this is going to be some date.  no harvey's bristol cream?
you're telling me you killed him? you? killed him? bullshit. what kind of gun did you use?
the band that found me and asked me to join.

c'mon.  i don't want any jones about this.
for when the time comes..
i'm not hungry, oddly.
i don't know. waiting, i guess. you know?
let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
well, i can't talk though --
so when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? like, do you dream?
what are you going to do?
finder's fee?
it's a good play, but risky.
maybe there's a better idea... what about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
then what?
they'd look silly on me.  i'm fourteen years old!
something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
your letter came yesterday.
sue. your clothes. lose them.
...but it's worth the risk. true or false: it's worth the risk.
what's the matter, charlie?
yes, i do. cuz i feel for you. mean to say...  i got feelings for you. and i didn't want you to think... i didn't...  i don't want you to go away. there's better ways to say what i'm trying to say, but... they it is. don't go away.
what do you care? let 'em have their fun. so, what's up?
she's in management....
i can do that.
how'd you know to have the calf ready, ma?
no, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
it's totally insane! we have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, i get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. i'll be totally wiped out!
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen.
something wrong?
yeah?
margarita found them while cleaning your room.
i'm trying to help you here.  there's warsaw, there's this --
well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
what's the matter?
oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
i only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
well, considering it is, in fact, happening, i would assume it's possible.  the retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
'the work,' jesus, ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
no you didn't.  you didn't even ask about billy.
how?
yeah!
he's setting that play to music?
oh, i'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  i think i'm going to like it here.
when can i squeeze one out?
aramis, porthos and athos too.  i know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your majesty.  if their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. forgive them.
excuse me?
you got everything right but the car. my dad didn't get me a bmw.
did you?
i should have known.  i came into the house when you were down on the beach.  she looked at me so strangely.  she left right after you.  i shouldn't have let her watch us. she wanted to watch me all the time.  she tried to kill you, didn't she?
you know what happened to this?
so, mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
don't give him anything.
where was that house? the one in la, i mean.
i'm not sure now. she said he used to be over at loma vista. i never heard of it.
we found him like this --
good luck with the fund raising.
because, you know, sir, he's got the i.q. of a rabbit.
oh, that was phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. look i'm so out of touch, i haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
nurse!
no.
you're staring at me.
did you talk to him?
you're so wrong.
i am?
transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
oh.
what?
yes.
how you guys doing?
i got him on loan from disney.
for me?
i don't know.
so then what, mr. wandering jack?
i just wanna talk with you for a minute.  then you can jump.  you can jump twice for all i care.
when did you guys have this conversation? when i was in the bathroom? what else did she have to say?
i still don't believe it.
but you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  well, it's not my first script.
have any trouble finding us?
don't touch me. just take me home.
you didn't see this.  understand?
hey mike, what can i say?
i'd like to place a 'personals' ad in the free press.
do you work for the san francisco police department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
it's no accident we stumbled on this money.  it's an answer to a prayer!  every night and every day i've prayed that god would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  tonight my prayer came true.
you fucking ass-holes.
you mean like bubber?  the hero?
you'd better kill me now, diego, because you're a dead man.
you're not going to fail me are you?
yes, mr. sheldrake.
no?  that mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? what are you going to do now?  kill us? kill us all?
you were contracted to work-
in a way, yes.
i like guys if that's what you're asking.  not that i trust'm.
hey, are you guys still there? what's going on?
yeah, i know... but she's only twenty seven and...  the wisdom.  she's an old soul.  she knew that shostakovich thing.  did you notice?
thanks a lot.
sorry to wake you, sir, but starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of enterprise.
answer me.  was the first time you saw me the first time i saw you? was it?  you've been following me around.  do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  that's not love, jerry.  it's obsession. and it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  can you?
thank you, mr. gillanders.  thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
a fin!
no, actually, she was referred to me.  she was dr. hagman's patient...
what does it look like?  it's an address book!
what is it?
my mother. died in '72. they told me after. they said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
what is it, norman?
welton academy, hello?  yes, he is, just a moment.  mr. nolan, it's for you.
mr. martins...
walter--
i'm showing summer rentals.  we got a helluva season going.
whose word?
hi, honey.
they found this in dickie's place in rome.
maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. say some words over him.
what are you, hoping?
look here, bob, ever since i can remember, you've looked after me. now i think you're the one that needs looking after. i'm your brother, bob. if there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
we're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
storage, i think.
please.
transwarp at your command, sir!
no, leave it. i'll do it later. listen, maybe you and floyd can come for dinner on saturday. i'm sure richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
you're supposed to call me when you lose your job early. i stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
well give me a reasonable explanation
i look stupid.  i look stupid, don't i? i look like i'm trying too hard.  i was going to get a haircut but then i thought i'd look like i just got a haircut. 
i don't even...what do you mean?  i don't even know what that means.
absolutely not.
check and mate.
where is the conference?
enough!  i already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... you will come to know such suffering as only the master of the bogan force can provide...
you just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
in sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
have a little snort?
charming chap.
because as far as i'm concerned, he's a no good fink. two weeks ago i wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
billy told the f.b.i. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
i figure we could go to new york, catch the knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the empire state building --
mickey?  what are you doing here?
they must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
what the fuck is dignan doing with that cop? he loves them.
i guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
dead?
i'm stopping by later. i'm worried about you. bye.
without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl i have ever seen -- the ringside audience is spotted with blood. this fight should have been stopped rounds ago but rocky balboa refuses to fall --
yes, the ship is down there. but the gold is gone.
hey, that's terrific.
i could use a little help. we have to return the van soon.
really? that's interesting.  not great?
wait a minute ... i'm talkin' to you.  i'm askin' you a question ...
sorry to lose you, baxter.
you know about it?
the papers are going to eat you alive.  even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  they want someone to be accountable.
i'm going in, sandy. i'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
are you sure you're up to this, mr. case? we could reconvene tomorrow.
i'm about to blow the wall.
hey, brad... how's it going?
bad news, gentlemen. shore leave's been cancelled.
and what are you implying?
how long do you stay up there before you go?
wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. i'll just take my five when the deal is done.
look under the body.
he saved himself.  he changed the past.
the president's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
goodnight, kringelein. 
yes.
mr. kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
you locked yourself in.
on our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. terminate us instantly. we'd never experience what it means to make love.
what'd you say?
i remember dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
hi, honey.  how was the flight?
let him do it! go-go-go-go-go!
i mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. i was gonna tell you but marcel wouldn't let me.
and this butterfield guy--
he knew about nasa. what if he made the call to shut us down --
no questions.
albert's got the stomach flu.
doctor trammel, when did you first diagnose that mr. marsh had heart disease?
only about a thousand times. what do i do now? "what's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
what doing?
you just worry about yourself, james. okay?
actually, i don't know...
because of the nature of murder.  "there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
hey!  what are you trying to do?  get yourself committed?
more people... gotta pick up where zenovich left off. people from outside the department.
crazy.  go along bayswater...
-- i don't know the musil district.
when are you coming back?
stay with me tonight.  not because you're being paid to. stay with me because you want to.
two.
what i've been doing?
see you soon, preysing. next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
dick, we need some time apart --
black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
the bomb, asshole!
what?  johnny, what's wrong?
he won't tell us where it is. the powwow safe.
well, anything coulda caused that.
well, all wars do -
oh there you are.
can i sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
does it hurt?
naturally.
waal, mr. moss, i wouldn't....
i love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
what's she doing?
what's her name?
are you still coming?
where'd you get this?!!
this operation is in two phases. recon and rescue.  you are phase one.  your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of american pows, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
what's from the governor?
perhaps forged is a better word.  like steel.  like a sword.  you're a modern samurai.  i've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like vincent. but i've never seen anyone like you.  i'm afraid vincent will die if he goes with you.
yes, the police must be called.
you weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, ray. you were sent here to assist in a selective operations unit. these regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to the graveyard, to indian country. i need you behind me, ray. not pulling against me.
get out of here!
i knew i left these somewhere. one of these'll send your kids to college someday.  here – i made this for you.
oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
she's right, paley.  you've got to kill me.  she doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  you supplied the coke.  you're an accessory to murder.
edie. the commission. your subpoena. i know you got a subpoena.
i might have, walter, but you were never there.
i heard you, i heard you.
all of it?
what did you think?
yes, isn't he.
subway.
two more.
may i have your coat?
you ever think about running away?
if i say no?
-- no. no really.
someone hired both of you?
-- did ya hear they nailed the bandit?
hi.
as far away as possible.
i wish i could stick it out like you.  i just, with trish and the kids...
little bill. the... the bar t boys caught him and little bill...
you're their uncle.
come again?
that's easy!
wbat're you talking about?
would you like some brandy?
please!  i want to help you. let me help you.
what's that?
say, buddy! who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
listen, he just needs to sleep it off. someone will take care of him.
does everybody have to hear?
there's so much, and so much of it is dull...
...and rob the place...
i think you have more.
you're talking about a very expensive risk here.
ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
how'd a guy like you end up in the legion anyways?
so you got a 'roid going with jackson or what?
hey, ted, sorry. i didn't know your family was in the garage when i set it on fire!
ah duh. boys. i've never even gone to first base with a guy. what do i do?
where's it coming?  where's he landing?
get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
you know alfred.  he'd never say anything.  but i can tell.  until you came along, alfred was the only family i ever had.  without him, i don't know how i would have survived.  he saved my life, dick.  and i've never told him.
are you <u>done</u>?
oh, you have my body.
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  i knew about it, but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business.  not till now, that is.
i'm very sorry, jimmy.  i apologize to you.
i been drivin' since i was twelve.
... 17 beverage cup holders?
seems he's stolen money from them. he's desperate and our only lead.
can you set up?
poor thing. does the ice help, rose?
are you calling stan?
oh, come on, buffy.  you know what's going on.  it's not working out at all.  i've got to move on.  i mean, i've got needs, too.  i told you about all this.
i have to go.
what makes you think that?
where's riccardo?
excuses are like assholes, taylor - everybody got one.
we allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. was we wrong?
where is he?
a drink to warm up?
you-killed-him?
you do?
the thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
maybe you're right.
can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on mary?
it's a bi-partisan issue. everyone needs to swallow hard. no one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
what do you mean, general?
i'm afraid not. i promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
helen -- why don't you and mary go on with clay?
who told you to look at elektra’s files?
what?
nice to meet you, fergus.
i feel better. do you?
yes, general. i am glad you came by. i overheard something that i think you should know about.
you know, you're not a <u>bad</u>-looking girl. in fact--i think you're lovely.
and you think the movie business is any different?
good morning, barry....
he's dead.  he did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in charity hospital, i think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  that's not gonna be me.
maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
i sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, i'm very sorry --
just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
but she wanted more out of life, right?
your son thomas and his wife virginia...
yeah...are we going to do it or what? i still haven't packed.
opening night, lillian.
...in the course of that night, mr. o'keefe said a man named david ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
we need each other now, i need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
my wife's death. i used to work in insurance, we were well covered.
michal dzikiewicz. he's my husband.
what will it do?
are you chewing gum?
let me kiss you.
jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
you mean immoral.
morning.  did you sleep?
no, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
no, ma i was at first--but not no more.
close up?
... and those?
that isn't true.  you never understood her.
where are you?!
don't be an asshole, richard.  they're gonna kill you.
i believe these young men are right.
and...you know jan gruner?
hey, what's your problem?
oh, no.  now what?
no!  i said it was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
bismark...
relax, fans.  the car isn't here.
why didn't you answer those questions?
any microorganisms?
i'm hesitant to...
then how would you describe him, beth? merely rebellious?
did you fix the damn film?  it broke in the last reel.
where 're you going?
geoff, dinner's ready!  geoff?!
latest casualty?  ernest harriman. you heard of him?
fuck you.
sure. why?
but...
how do you know?
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you.
oh.  you look so beautiful.
where did you meet my father?
oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. no.
uh-huh?
but mine cost the most so i don't see how it could smudge.
you're telling me this maniac is a cop? what the hell am i supposed to do with that one?
you cannot.
so far you've let it cross the heart of america. for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. i don't see the humor in that.
i was born with a limp, sir.  the militia used to hate it when i marches with them because my pike would always sway...
-- black.
where?
will shakespeare!
i had to call.  i jus got off the phone with james kross.  get this.  he wants to see you. today.
i'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, miss. unless you charter a plane.
but then you knew what he was like all along... maybe his killing kelly was a thing you had counted on...
i wouldn't say that--  i'm glad he's dead--yes--i'd thought of killing him-- but i didn't--
well, why not?
have a good time.
problem. she doesn't have a bank account.
now i'm the one who's nauseous. so what's the deal? what do you need me for?
is there an antidote?
look, i must have pupils. without pupils i can't manage.
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
i didn't know where she was going to lead you.
don't worry about that.  guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
so?
i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
he did something with the ground.
sorry friend, i had no choice. they arrived right before you did.
look! i didn't ask to be in you. don't blame me for it. you did it.
if you're going to be indiscreet, i wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. rich men, like winton, love you and leave you.
state your case, mr. prosecutor.
why dr. weir, i think you're in love.
this is state-of-the-art firepower.
where are we?
i'm just saying it was cold.  i think she kind of liked me.
two p.m. great. bye-bye. 
we haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
hey.
i got it.
what have they done to you now?
you were enlightened?
i'm sorry, did you just call me "lotte"?
...i stank, didn't i?
i forgive you.
you seem restless.
for the church?
huh! really? hotels?
it's nice that they're still friends.
what's causing that!?
that dog was mean before i met him.
what?
pat does projects all over the world.
we just got moved up in the world. you gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. you gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
admiral, i have a signal closing on the whales. bearing 328 degrees.
it makes it all seem so serious.
you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
do those two work for your dad or mine?
tarazine?
) what?
judy, please it can't matter to you...
filled? that's impossible! they haven't even seen my work. i need this post. please, can't you help me? please!
say again?
i'm a housewife.
uh, captain...
what does it mean, indy?
i'll expose you.
didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
god, i haven't seen you all day.
you gotta hold this for me.
why?
give it to her, dad.  it'll make her happy.
that locket you're holding. you have one just like it.
come on. you're fucking hungover.
no, dammit.  it's a matter of life or death.
what's going on, tom?  what happened?
you're very funny --
can you ascertain if there's proloid in his system?
you missed the last three, including her birthday.  your wife's gripe sheet.
well, george viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. viznick is not psychotic. he's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
but there may be a few around somewhere.
i'm sorry, i can't.
it sounds like you're doin' really super.
i guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
we got it back, that's all.
you're kidding me.
who are the britons?
you'll wait in the hall?
but that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
how much for these five?
could i have a puff?
what are you doing?
can we go home soon rachel?
what are you thinking?
what happened?
he said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
ignorant.  the thing's ignorant.
you know, anne does other people too. sort of a sideline... 
let's go.
well, what're you going to do?
what? wait a minute... talk to me.
where'd he come from?
you and i have done nothing. you especially. we are innocent.
i got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
ok.
you're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
who the hell is jimmy?
you learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. but then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
yes?
well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
this is c.r.s.
still hallucinating as well. hmm...
i'm impressed you can sew.
fan of a fan.  you see a couple of minors come in?
ooohhhhhh! i made it all up! i never saw beverly sutphin in my life!
well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. i'll tell you what. let's do it tonight. right now.
still a coincidence.  timing and all.
dr steckler?
that's what you want, isn't it?
yes.
can you set that up?
i came home early and found your note. i guess you meant for me to read it later. elaine, i've got to talk to you.
what's that? only -- you're getting too near. i don't trust anybody.
ann. are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
shut up.  here's to a great week.
we've got to put that, into the inaugural.  "i have here, a ribbon.  you haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  for it is the proud possession of a few, a very few men and women... it is the ribbon of the albanian campaign...."
what's happening here?
well it just doesn't happen anymore mrs. macneil.
where?
mr. m.?
i wish you'd gone to your parents like i asked you.
i am?
they don't want to come down.
how is it now?
then who is?  come on, nell.  deep down, if you really thought it wasn't jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  why wouldn't you be afraid?  really afraid.
hi, baby. what are you doing awake? where's mommy?
take a top coat.
you really should go in, it's marvelous.
now, i want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
it has to be at sophie's. she didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
i suppose you want a cabin.
is that so?
of what?
can you see well?
slow down, huh?
how dare you. you're disgusting and evil.
you're a doctor. what kind?
a what?
all right! now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are d. b., was trying to use that to shove his way into the white house. so he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. what would you say about that? huh?
-- well no. it never came up.
and what's that?
you are correct.  sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  such as your own, for example.  how do you feel about physical labor?
what?
don't bend back like that.
i'm not married.
hi.
in a little while. that's what you want, isn't it?
that's good.  i knew it wasn't nothin'.
you're kidding.
we're fucked.
but nothing is happening.
my god, you're shot...
what night?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...city council...?  what's the trouble...?
did she throw up?
how'd that happen!  what kind of trouble you in?
you kicked us off your turf, merk. don't rain on our parade.
he's preaching.
god damn it, i must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
it's december 25th, 1993 today.
i can't. i have to stay with my patient.
i cannot--
how; we don't know where they are?
well -- i, uh, that is to say mr. dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of marylin rexroth doyle massey uh dumbart -- uh, massey.
ride 'em cowboy)
after that, i went out of fashion. i was no longer able to command the best projects, so i walked away.  why should i spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  the students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  they want to explore.
any bodyguards?
hence the expression...
no plan is perfect, lenny.  hey, cheer up.  world's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
coffee?
4:25.
half.
yeah.
shit!
you chickenshit punk...
wow just like marco polo.
now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
cut it out.
if you want... i can take you back to town now.
the thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
i'm not asking about the color. i mean is it rough or cottony?
look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. it becomes what he is. why fight it? what do you know? how long you been a hack, a couple months? you're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
have it your way, mr. venkman.
so, what was it like humping bleeker's bony bod?
of course, mr. gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
that's right, i set you up. you're a veteran at this, dutch, i had to.
why are you so upset?
no, gittes, you'll show us.
what?
if you want.
did mr. marsh change his lifestyle after that?
you told me i'm safe?  i'm going for a walk in the park.
hey, wait a minute, mr. doe!
not, "eternity forever"?  the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  i'd kill for that part.
you guys always think i should know everything, and you never tell me anything. am i right?
i better go report this in...
i can't even imagine.
that's called changing your mind.
you won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  you also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
what's a jizz-mopper?
how will i know you?
i wish you'd make sure.
i guess we get what we pay for, huh?
first we got to get equality on the job. then we'll work on these other things. leave it to the men.
get him to atlanta.
okay, what's the information?
goddamn. will somebody please tell me why i read this spy crap.
we got beat.
i didn't want to spoil our supper...
i feel -- fidgety, ma -- not right at all.
what the hell you smiling at? just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those smbs --
....relax roget  you're 82m in the account numbers and i'm the invisible man... they're always looking for red flags, gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
you've been with gray again.
what's wrong, mary, are you drunk? look, i've had a rough night, one of the roughest i've ever had, now i'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? are you sick? are you drunk? can you work?
i have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
come on. frozen. how much are they?
yes sir, i did.
yes. he's a good kid. maybe a little messed up.
how grateful?
oh mama, i'm so... tired of that song.
maybe there's more to this, susie. the cia's keeping something from our enemies.
that's a lie! i figured it out! i've been trying to tell this dumbass --
what do you actually know with religion?
and you went home unannounced, too?
kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
it's too late for that. i've gone ahead of the curve on this one. there's no turning back. when this is over, koessler is going to be right or low is going to be right or i'm going to be right, but not all of us.
you have a record of what happened in the operating room...
he said he wanted to talk to you. when he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, i wanna talk to him." i thought he meant back in detroit. i thought he meant --
hello?
are you board-certified in anesthesiology, doctor?
go ahead!
who said anything about the catholic church...
well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
an attempted slit.
at this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
it's not supernatural.  mbwun is an animal.  part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam.
they said you're the one.
i see.  ... say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
what do you like best about her?
will you miss me?
i am now, sir.
get down!  he'll see.
me?  well, i believe in rome... you'd have to after what i've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
baby, you're money. you're the big winner.
that’s right. and auto supply...
can't we just be friends, diz ?
well, why don't you say it?
... oh?  why is that, vicki?
think i'll look aroun' an' see if i can't meet me a girl.
did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place?
no, dad. you listen to me --
big ringo fan.
up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
"i had forgotten this. i had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. then i remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. and i remembered it was my idea. i remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. i had forgotten that too. and i wondered, as i sat there... how many other things i'd forgotten."
i made the plume from a quail feather.
the plutonium is missing.  they’ve taken the core!
where's tyler?
i have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. so far, they've had no success.
uh ...
madame pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
i was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
say, maestro - where were you at three o'clock on st. valentine's day?
something happened.  you got nuked in the last quarter.
well...  i must admit, when my assistant told me you were here i was, really -- i was quite -- i was surprised.
you are such a wet.
no way. this would just provide some stability is what i'm saying. i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
well, i'll try to give her one.
my encounter.
you are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
look. you want to talk about this?
he made it clear.
i do not recollect, your majesty. will that be all?
how do you guarantee that?
but <u>we</u> let him out.
alfred, if i've never told you...i just want to say...
we order from dairy queen at noontime usually. we can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
i know.
satisfied? now get out. out.
al?
wuddya do?  carl looks around.
yes, the lord's been pretty good to us. i guess you're a church man, aren't you?
oh, jesus!  you're kiddin'!
es impossible.
nice shot, lins.
how they goin', kid?
why weren't you honest with me? why did you keep your marriage a secret?
it'll grow on you.
just do what i do.  say the same thing i say.  don't open your mouth.
my insurance does not cover pms
you said that.
god, where the hell did you come from?  you scared me to death.
and three weeks.
and all his works?
worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. all banks on my mark. scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
you're going to drive me crazy!
doesn't suit you.
the flying. the fighting.  i'd go up there ten times a day to fight. i'd win at least nine of them. that's all i want to do. it's what i do best. i am real good.  just give me the jet.
say something it's too quiet.
fuck you!
you bitch.
you liked this woman. you used her several times.
that good, huh?
a very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
dad?
i don't... seek publicity -- will you be staying in gotham for a while?
did you get his number?
upon my word, sir, i think you have acted very coolly.
you want to be a bounty hunter. why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
what's that?
bad dreams?
go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the french underground --
do you ever see him?
is that why klute didn't tell me?
are you hungry?
why don't we go in? get another crack at him tomorrow.
yes. the city of the dead. where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt.
oh!!
one we're producing.
hey, hey, hey. j. edgar would've loved you. he'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "to enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
what happened?
you can't sell me that, walter.
why are you here?
i have to go —-
first offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  the piggy bank.
listen to me, anthony. i got your head in a fuckin' vise. i'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. don't make me have to do this, please. come on. don't make me be a bad guy. come on.
i don't know ...
new hushpuppies don't make a new man.
haiphong? shit, you jump in ?
oh-hhh!!! go on, do me in you bastard cowards. i don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
any progress?
this is it.
what is it?
you'll need one more hit.
huh.
excuse me?
what?
she's alive.  they brought her here and you know it.
flattering.  and, who's your colorful little chum?
thank you all for your efforts, but i'm afraid we can no longer get into malkovich through the portal.
where is rae?
well, we're back to that, huh? i say to you, "what do you feel like doing tonight?" and you say to me, "i don't know, what do you feel like doing?" and then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching sid caesar on television. well, i tell you what i feel like doing. i feel like calling up this mary feeney. she likes you.
i'll look over the q and a.
you stole this truck!
here...  here...
is it marsh?
but it's christmas now.
that’s my car!  you stole my car!
good for you.
actually --
yeah, but never what you looked like. not really. never really studied your face, like now. i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
is it?
i said, the northwest valley.
i could eat a horse.
i just wish you would stop interfering, mother! i don't want promotion. i'm happy where i am.
everyone... please give domino her space. step back, please!
what happened?
that's marvelous.... you must have worked day and night.... don't you ever sleep?
i am sorry, mr. mcmanus.  f implore you to believe me, mr. keaton. mr. soze is very real and very                             + determined.
hey, gallagher!
well --
jesus. what are you doin?
but, you got four children!
why?
pull yourself together, man.
oh, great...
the great mantini?
but they are not yet one of us.
what's your name?
you've heard the stories right?
what?
... so, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  am i right?
i don't believe you.
hey, bob.
not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
otis!!  shostakovich identified with the jew.  he felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism.
a dirty frame!
i still feel...
you ever been to jail?
i'm too messed up to teach.
fine.
in this courtroom, mr. miller, justice is blind. to matters of race, creed, color, religion. and sexual orientation.
man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
she knew she could beat it.  that's why she asked to take it.
better.
how does that help me?
she could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  listen...
yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
jesus.
careful,  captain, they've been known to charge.
and?
well come over, will you? see the place?
'it was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' message, spock?
you seem very sure about that.
we're going to steal a ship?  that ship?
you know, i noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  i could sense the chemistry between us.
what? what the hell're you talking about.
the white house.
oh, come on. i went into this with my eyes open, you know. i knew the bottom could drop out at any time. i'm a working girl, right?  you don't think i'm gonna go into a situation like this if i don't think i'm gonna get covered on the back end.
comin' in or goin' out?
ladder 20 was on the rock for training. we stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
jesus, eddie, is this who i think it is?
where's regan?
i... i guess i might... but like i said, i ain't armed.
that's a relief. it's nice to know i'm a regular guy.
we can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  then we can run for it.
no.
i remember spring break of my senior year.  seems like a lifetime ago.
hi.
we can't <u>afford</u> a war.
not at all.
milo? i'm danny.
that is not true.
some crazy guy.
if it's good advice.
because you're still working for cohaagen.
they're moving away.
what is it?
what's through here?
boating?
did you speak to oswald in dallas?
it was premeditated -- i knew exactly what i was doing!  i strangled her!  i bludgeoned her! i set her on fire!  i did it!  i killed her!
well, yeah. you're the best friend i've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
you looked like you did?
i know.  that's why i want you to be fair with them.
jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... what are you shootin'?
i heard!  i heard!
rooney's protecting someone. who is she protecting?
this isn't music!
oh, yeah?
because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
he's right-handed.
why are you telling me this?
hello, billy.
ricky, you're becoming quite human. i suppose we have to thank you for that, mademoiselle.
are you all right?
the police have the poor unfortunate lad in the bridewell.
grab the coffee, will ya?  i told zed i'd give him a buzz.
is this mine?
not just juanito. you'll have it good too, esperanza. we're going to win this strike.
addison, just a few minutes ago. when i told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything i wanted-
i think i'm losing you.
when did john divorce?
it was a combination of all three.
we might lose the signal.
them's the keys. all you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' english bob can ride out free as birds.
you best find me another ranked contender an' i mean in a flash, man!
mr... i'm sorry, what was your name again?
hello. my name is lydia sinclair.
ah, jeez, billy... careful!
you almost ended my career before it began.
if you could be count chocula, frankenberry or trix the rabbit, who'd you be?
they look nice, i agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? i might get laughed at. how much do you want for these muskets?
now that you mention it, i sure would like to call my aunt up in portland and tell 'er where i am so she can come visit me.
decorated?
and do i detect a rebuke?
jeff wigand, michael moore.
dr. royer-collard? may i be the first to welcome you to charenton --
welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
the royal.
huh?
silence... silence.
what's wrong? is everything okay?
that other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
can you recall no melody of mine? i was the most famous composer in europe when you were still a boy. i wrote forty operas alone. what about this little thing?
mary clarence, perhaps you are correct.
we heard firing.  he get anybody? you alone?
well, i come back, didn't i?
the word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  he is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
to be determined by the proper authorities.
don't apologize for me.
you know, we know each other.
god. i'm beginning to lose faith in the united states government and that includes the telephone system. don't you folks talk to one another. that's her trailer there and i haven't touched a god damn thing. agent chet desmond come by a second time and asked too see deputy cliff howard's trailer  ...which i showed him. i went back to my trailer...  after that i never saw him again.
the lighthouse?
nothing further, your honor...
raoul... oh, raoul...
now release the brake. and slide the stick into first gear.
what did you think?
thank you very much.
surely you knew this was coming.
thank god.  i got to see you. grown up.
umm. well. yes. but no more strange voices in the night, rose.
good. so do i.
i want my man back.
so, do you think you made it into the class?
f-i-n-k. fink, barton. that must be you, huh?
what's that?
i'm so damn sorry about your loss. terrible thing. just damn terrible.
pearl and john.
i should have phoned... but i wanted to see you... be with you...
they're running me ragged. nothing but question day and night... i love it! come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. there's a bajoran band at the officer's mess.
you forgetting the gag line, killaine.  the police don't take anything for granted.
you okay?
i'm not sure. my guess is that's what sid wants us to think.
because i'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
your hair looks the same.
take it to him.
you have to save this boy. good exists in this world. i can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
good night, daphne.
mr. chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a driver's license, a credit card, checkbook?
that your father and i ——
i didn't say.
i wouldn't be doin' that, snake.
another one?
are you totally insane?!
shit!
you will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  not this lane. not today.
a trip to the outer rings. whad'ya think of that ?
i had to be the ham! i had to shoot off my mouth!
where could you take them?
and maybe my lawyer.
some pretty bad people.
why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  it's the most obvious solution: escape.  she knows she can't leave here --
they might as well arrest me, too; i felt like lieutenant saavik.
i'm so sorry, stu. i <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. i really, really liked you.
657-2036
thank god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
hi.
i hate j.j. -- but not that much at this moment...
oh, m'sieu laval ...
i can beat him, bert. now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. i didn't think he did. but i can outplay him. i can beat him.
chris.  we got it.  let's go.
the fifth element... the supreme being... your wife...
as if that name, shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
i'm here with jenny.
you don't expect me to do that do you?
you heard what abbott said?
no, 007. it's just that i've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  somehow the reality is never as... satisfying as the fantasy.
you think he's dirty?
we were divorced by then.  things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
ray gibson?  no, no. he's the reason i'm in here, daisy. for all i know, he's got a record a mile long. i got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. you tell maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. understand?
yeah?
i made macaroni.
tell me i'm dreamin'.
you can't bring it.
don't tell me --
a man?  was it a dream?
schwarz. jewish?
let's see...do you know her cup size?
god veronica, drool much? his name's jason dean. he's in my american history.
good, sir. and so, it seems, did the president - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation?
oh?
i made a mistake. i'll never make another one.
i'm not allowed to see you anymore.
i don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  there must be some design schematics... blueprints...
man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. viagra ain't working.  my back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  but check this out.  i got to lay some ground rules.  your my family and i love you.  you're welcome to anything you want in my home. but i don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
hey!  that's my boss!
are you running away?
elvis i like, too.
what was that, doolittle?
we're holding the workers down below.
emily.  just kidding.
why don't they answer our hails?
nothing.
what's that, curly?
young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here i hit it right, our romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
i know a little about psychology. i took three different courses in college. it's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but i took them... and there was one concept i remember very well.
no, i'm questioning your hearing! you hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." i hear... "potential brown & williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of cbs to westinghouse." i hear... "shut the segment down. cut wigand loose. obey orders. and fuck off...!" that's what i hear.
it's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. it must've cost dr. gaskell a lot.
yes, i'm right?
girl, what are you doing?
a voice. a voice from the states. someone new.
holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
will i still be able to play?
lots of people. guy like evan twombley, boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. the government's been investigating his links with the mafia.
now i know a few things. i know you have had a rough day. you're probably thinkin' i don't know the half of it, but in actual fact i know every part of it. the business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
i don't know what that means.  what kind of problem?
you still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
i'm not asking.
why?
jesus.
i just came from the school, madam. i don't know about their brain pans but...
you've been doing some research in the archives.
i should be going. i just quit.
jim!
you want to see him too, right?
that's the good news?
i am the borg.
christ, you should have seen it. unbelievable.  the kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like rasputin. that kid was scared.  not half as much as we were though.
you weren't there. i saw it.
well you're different, no arguing that.  but you're a lady all right. i'll take my oath on it.
living across the street from a grade school. jesus.
when'd they file the demur?
yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
please... no?  you mean "not here" -- that's it? you're a private available but particular.  don't worry. there's no one here but me. and you.
cartman! what the hell are you talking about?! you love terrance and philiip!
your dog was killed?
that man is gonna be on that roof. don't ask me how i know. i just know. and you know it as well as i do.
philistine.
that was an awful thing to say to me.
no other reason —— no woman ——not the little miss gibson?
yeah, well, she started all that in london.
stick with carla.
no love.
hold on.
it's terribly good.
i don't even know how to live with myself.
for what?
how's the print coming?
we don't go around altering valuable paintings, dr. venkman.
no one else that i know?
would you like a cup of tea before you go?
something the matter with the cuisine?
a hospital is no place for secrecy, mr. treves. doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? is he contagious?
i'm better than the guy i work for.
what about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
ed, i swear, i'm not --
yea, ok. i will be, i will be, i promise.
you never had it.
y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the army sent.
you got a girl-friend?
please...
you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
don't throw that away. i had that once with a guy. but i threw it away for a cheap thrill.
jesus, sarge, what is this thing?
they're townies?!
how do we get to the vault door?
not bad enough to kill him.
why... yes.
no-
-- nothing i can do about it unless you're suggesting i infringe on their civil liberties -- which i'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the constitution.
how's your mother feeling?
probably makes it worse. dehydrates you even more.
no way.
what?
allow me some time.  i have spent every hour in the company of others. i need to be alone.
i've gotta kill some jews, kyle. i'm serious. i'm always talking about it. this time it's gotta happen.
the one she wore on her wedding day?
yeah.
aren't we early?
the doctor will be round later. would you like a picture book to look at? we have some lovely funny beanos.
where are you, anyway?
that was... the first one.
and you're too young.
somebody had to say it. i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
i don't know. he just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
yeah?
yes -- it is.
i ain't gonna tell you no more. no pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. you're killing your own people asshole.
he wrote me a nice deposition. he says he just received the drugs. you did the selling.
i dunno.
hello, brad -
you were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
i mean it.  take care of it.
help! help!!
what's your name, giant?
drew is none of your damn business. nor is where i put my mouth.
would they hurt her?
so did i. now pack up a few basics and --
wait. stop. you don't seem to understand. you're not really comprehending any of this. i killed him. i did it, carnes. i'm patrick bateman. i chopped owen's fucking head off. i tortured dozens of girls. the whole message i left on your machine was true.
i'll drink to that.
i guess i could teach you some things.
have you been up all night again?
yeah ...
what do you do?
*some*body got to take the blame. they just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  an' i ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
what's in the box?
uh-huh, i was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then i thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
an on-site monitoring well?  that means --
you're just like your father, lee.  all these years hiding behind his badge.  i wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  when you think about it, i didn't really kill him.  i just put him out of his misery.
where are we running?  what am i missing here?
old sam stood for somethin', you know? the day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
they left.
huh?  no, she, she hit me right here.
oh, you know me, martin. i'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed i got shot for at kent state. but why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
first of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. we're already on the list to be heard before the supreme court of the united states later this year.
now don't get nervous.  it's just your husband.
i was right! step on it!
my god, what in hell happened here?
macfarlane
africa?  that's so far?  how do they get here?
yeah, well...  so when are you going to get your job?
i've been buying you stuff all week. i've been buying him stuff all week.
i'm getting a little bit fat. i hate that.
it takes time --
calm down.
grammy had a different kind. there are lots of kinds.  hers was very bad.
same as they done in mexico.
the page's missing. then their sos was real.
hold on, damn it.  we're getting nowhere... if this bit of blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
mister laplante, i really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  the d.a. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
i'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  you want some ice?
my name is sam lowry. i have to report to mr warren.
how about italy?
okay, jason, your move.
tom, what we need is an act of congress to allow enzo to become a citizen.
turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
i don't know what they teach at harvard, but i think i'm pretty good enough the way i am !
i was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. and i slipped and i would have gone overboard... and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
not the focus.
i was not a failure.
that's the way it was told to me.
relax, war hero. we took you for a ride, and you came through. not bad for a dirtbag like you.
oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
oh, yuh did, huh?
hello regan. i'm a friend of your mother, i'd like to help you.
hello.
okay.
yeah.  it was terrible.
...but i got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
no sign of the snowman.
do you know that it's illegal?
but i suppose you know the answer.
how long has it been?
do you recognize any of them?
you and who else?
call my secretary, she'll set something up.  factory looks great, folks.  keep up the good work.
it was?
you're looking worried again, helena?
no.
can i have a glass of water?
why not?
well, people gotta get by somehow. that's the curse. the mines done it. all that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! everybody's got a mother. you don't rip up your mother. you don't rip up the earth and take everything out. it's like the cracker jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
have you got any make up?
because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  and because you have large resources.
zack, i dare you not to fall in love with me. i ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. but how can you resist me? i'm like candy.
and you. why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? did you miss us that much?
i love you...
indy... indy, you must hurry!! come quickly!
someone should hurt them.
go in where?
scared.  no, not scared.  wary. like i was something to be... her guard went up.  i was a threat.  now i know why.  she was afraid she'd be seen.  that i would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. but that's the cycle, right?  i knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  i guess that's part of the reason why --
i got some hair stuff.
we can't just leave him.
shut up, jesse.
i'm working with you because of that memo...
ph.d., psychologist.
you still wake up sometimes, don't you? wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
yes.
well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
i'm hurting.
yes.  it is, george.  yes.  it's a big decision.  and it's a big reward.  it's a big reward.  for one night's work.  but it's got to be tonight.
she's probably smash you in the fucking face.
so -- uh -- how was your first class?
fantastic but i'm a little busy right now.  listen.  do you want to come to dinner saturday?  i'm having some friends over and i need a spare man. are you a spare man?
let's work it.
entering the upper ionospere...
shhh... remember this is a privilege, so i don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. kay?
sir, i understand.  i don't like it, but i understand.
they say you never forget.
just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
party ain't started yet, dick.  got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... there's some fellows i want you to meet.
were you recently in the bathroom?
what?  what?  that boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
about me?
...here.   mason... 
he is kind of cute, isn't he?
come on, paula! you were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! or the class before that!
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. that should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
yeah, oz, but not when she's on land.
what's so illogical about that?
i've got to go.
who are you - the goddamn bionic woman?!
really?
don't need a lecture. you fucking told maya, didn't you?
mom doesn't like me to have them.
uh...home...
it's gonna work, dad.  we're gonna stop him.
stuff it! my girl friend's coming from liverpool tonight.  nice surprise, isn't it?
more metal... sharp edge...
what?! but i did everything you said to do!
why didn't you call?
i think i may have found a way out of here.
what about your shoulder?
me?
here's a real present.
you're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at charenton...
there is nothing to discuss.
no, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. the one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
i just... he came back for kendall. i don't think he's capable of murder.
the ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
wow. you must have 20,000 lines of code there...
no.  we had a drink at the club. we left together.  i came here. he went home.
who is that horrible friend of yours?
you must have drunk too much.
let's go now.
myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
sorry. i -- i don't make the rules.
yes.
max offered to stake me.
no shit.
i got the message you called.
i never said that!
it's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
unfortunately what he wants is you.
it's got a lot of good things.  of course, it would be an expensive picture...
sure.
you're very --- different.
could we go upstairs and talk? it's so loud down here.
her name is death.
what?
the thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
okay, randy. thank you.
i am so glad to see you!!  i thought i'd never see you again!
who? miss dawson?
you're living at home now. is that right?
where is he now?
i <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me shirley! what flying experience have you had?
better hurry, doc.  a real story.  with a real reporter.
oh dear, are you actually laughing?
why, did you tell corey what happened?
i told his father he'd be on that flight.
we're going to have to work on your touch.
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. here's to ya, uh...
basically -- he asked me if i could unring a bell.
honest to god, if i got to do it over? i'd start walkin' outta this town the minute i took my first step. practically the only thing i wouldn't do different is have you...
ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. when're you due?
you're right.  you're right.  look, i'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  you know that.
what da fuck!  are you deaf?
...the archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
was it?
thanks. 
i hope the man knows what he's doing....
he can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  did you give him an approval?
you'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
is that what they're calling him?
i.a.'s going to talk to you more about nilsen.  they're handling the investigation, we're not. stay in touch with dr. gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
look at this.
you promise?
do you think francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
i'm talking to the spirit of jethro macdonald. is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? we'll be careful of the bed --
and you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
he's just as crooked as the next guy. you'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
what!
what does that mean?
good morning.
sang.
i just haven't seen you like this in a while.  i'm used to seeing you more sedate.
my advice?  hop on over to reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
nothing.
i'll never see them again, mister mulvaney.
compared to what came before? a year of living in the sewers?  a part of that will always be with me.
he knows who you are!  he's afraid!  i can tell!
sweet.
has she called?
send him home.  you don't want him to see it.
youíre probably right.
no... i can't!
like a spear.
anybody live here?
well there....  what's the difference?
okay. all our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. let's keep chilly. think slow. any questions?
now, remember -- keep it simple.
is that a request or a command?
if you don't, we will.  it has to be total, deckard.  that's an order from as high as it comes.  got it?
is this a trick?
help cook?
yeah.
i don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. another gang i know - you'd love them. they're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. people who are worthwhile.
well, i'll tell you. i got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and i just met an old girl i used to know, and i was wondering how i'm gonna get rid of the girl i'm with. somebody to take her home, you know what i mean? i'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
i'll take care of it, sir.
florist?
what's going on, logan?!
they're too tight.
what i said before --
"do what you can"?! that's not good enough i
depends on big brother.
well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her daddy.
nothing.
i just don't excite you at all... i don't know what you want... i don't know what you like...
shelly!  where are you?!
well jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
grow up, heather. bulimia's so '86.
what kind of law?
look, i showed you my badge...
it's a bluff, vince.
too much to do...but i'll walk you out.
to bring your sister those birds. you said it was her birthday. besides, i was coming up anyway.
about as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. good to see you, son.  did you bring any of that yankee whisky with you?
oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
where'd you get this?
who?  just -- someone we know.
hi.
thank-q!
toh-pak-cha=8a 
don't they ever let us take these boots off?
it's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. you may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, mr. merrick. it is lights and music, gaiety and joy. it's... well, it's romance.
will you two cut it out?
you dropped a glass.
i'm not pregnant.
aaaah. did we meet someone special?
what is it?
anyway.
where do we go?
hah! it's all make-up, chauncey... i asked nurse teresa to fix me up, i didn't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk.
yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  god, listen to this!  "it was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
look pakeesa...
no.
she blames tony pee-pants pinterello for everything. the fall of the british empire, the cold war, the internet.
how did you feel... being denied those hungry hungry hippos?
back - back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. one minute. i asked you?! when the fuck did i ever ask you if i could come out here?! get this through your head, you -
you know what you just signed, jeanne?  you just signed away my existence... for you i'm a lie, an illusion.  you see?  in the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
i have this concept for a tv pilot. there's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
it is--you know what a struggle he's had.
i can, mulder. i debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because i knew --
fats, let's you and i shoot a game of straight pool.
what do you mean grammar?
cause if you're losing your mind, i got a right to know.
jackie --
all right. what's been going on?
ohhh, that's lousy scotch!
no, i can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. this is as private as we'll get.
hello, aunt theresa.
that's the problem! how can i find john g. when i don't know what's going on?! how did you get me into this?!
yes i am!
ma -- is she? --
so?
you're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
quite well, really. it's a lot of work. a lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. right now i've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. tiny napkins of course.
my code name was blackjack.  night shift was my coach.  uh-uh-uh, i'm sorry. mason was my coach.
hold the line here. do not shoot! the colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. paul approaches oliver
i'll say anything you want me to say. i fuckled salvy. i fucked tommy. i fucked your brother. i fucked everybody! what do you want to hear? i sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
mother...
hi.
it's ok, it's ok...
i look terrible.
i said my earrings <u>are</u> american. they're african-american.
bullshit. it's mine, motherfucker.
okay. three-twenty sycamore? . . .
there it is, good as new.
thanks.
the ladder?
flip six, three hole.
shit.
what are you doin' up again, frank? you need to get a little sleep.
you know i'm not a communist, don't you, jer?
good. what do you want?
here's your jacket!
well... you control everyone's fate. you're like the puppetmaster.
yes, father. yes! so much for my vow of chastity. what did it matter? good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? had goodness made me a good composer? i realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. and i was nothing to god.
it's fuckin' real!  it's fuckin' real!
i'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  we can't risk it.
please, just leave the car alone.
i guess you have to go on faith.
that's okay.
there's a plus side?
old slave superstition. you sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... so they say.
goodnight.
endorse me in public.  do that and i'll make you rich and set you free. i'll return your estates.  i know you would give anything to be outside again.  endorse me and you will be free.  think of it.  what would you do with your freedom?
not really...  maybe a couple of peacemakers...  i imagine you could overlook those, eh, bill? if you didn't see them... or hear them?
don't pay attention to him, stew. he doesn't know what he's talking about.
how do you think you're going to make a living?
well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
all right. fine.
i mean did you call anyone.
c'mon, don't make an issue of it. do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
how do you know there is a grand hotel?
just what the hell is wrong with you?
that's your father's diary, ann.
just fine.
that's impossible, man.  this fence is high-tensile.  the breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. i know, i put it up.
i love that dream.
not quite...quarter cherokee. the rest is welsh...so they tell me.
the other families won't sit still for all out war.
mike! you have a mess on c-9!
i think so. but we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
oh that was... no, i ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. it's you. i want you.
what is going on?
shall we go away for a couple of days?
he said how you was really three fingered jack out of missouri... an' bill said "same three fingered jack that dynamited the rock island and pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" an' ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than william bonney or clay alisson or the james brothers an' how if he hurt ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a u.s. marshall in '73.
hey! don't use all the hot water!
the only thing which exists is myself.
what the fuck was you told? don't talk, right?
you know what i'm thinking?
oh, okay. i think i get it.
ulcers.
from the sun.  it's a reflection on the glass.
...mm-hmm.
stay away. or else.
what, no flowery speeches? about what a monster i am? what a vulgar fiend?
you want to hit?  yo, claude. give can't get right a shot.
is the baby okay?
you just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  i told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
geez, i feel bad for him. maybe we should've told him abou -
you wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
you go first. i'll be right below you.
don't think the rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
i read your paper on eti's.  it's brilliant.
you'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
the pied piper of hamelin. by famous hanover city; the river weser, deep and wide, washes its wall on the southern side; a pleasanter spot you never spied; but, when begins my ditty...
hey, skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
i'm tellin' ya, i'm giving you all i know.
lots of fellas do. tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
i hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
"dear lisa. i've enjoyed working with you. i'd be lying if i didn't say i find you attractive. but in my heart i know that alice..."  you left my party to send e-mail?
who says that i'm protecting anyone?
yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
...i didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  we don't know who's straight up, who's not...
are you calling me?
that's what gives me the fear.
you're alive! she didn't kill you!
no wonder he let her go.
this here's the desert an' we're right in it!
walter.  this compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  in your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
conveniently enough for you.
what happens when the baby comes?
what were you doing in felton?
he ruined it! that lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
let me pass!
but the deal's already done, i already got the money -
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  so he climbs up.  to cut it down.
oh, and but one word with one of us? couple it with something. make it a word and a...a blow.
but the thing is, if i'm gonna be a senator by the time i'm thirty -- i can't keep dicking around.
no thanks.
yeah, under hollenbeck bridge, what's wrong with that?
i thought you were a december baby.
suit yourself.
i was drying out.
thanks so much for coming over.
why do you think --
you a god damn witch?
that's your proof?
yeah. well, maybe i'll change it.
i hope i didn't keep you from something.
all my life, everyone has been telling me that when i have sex, i'm not really having sex.  not real sex. but they're wrong.  i know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
okay, let's hear it. i'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
i'd rather you didn't.
you want to have dinner?
no, that's enough. i just wanted you to get the idea. now you know. this house is haunted.
i'm sorry, i didn't--
all the graves?
i'm busy.
just sit here for a moment. you seem very upset.
i'll try.
it's only that i really enjoy your company and...
no.  please.
well, i...
you went berserk...
really?
i hope she's all right.  how much more do i have to do of this?
no, i didn't mean to sound negative. it was -- but ben.  what is going to happen with us? have you --
objection.  asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
oh, i wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
no you won't.
what's my name?
mr. wood?  <u>what do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
where are you?
yes.
as large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  it's posed as a question. what am i?
no, ma'am.  this is no joke.  and neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
al, what's wrong?  did something --  -- oh, god.  you're coming in!  that's it, isn't it?  christ, powell, i told you what you're dealing with here --
mrs. bundy, you don't seem to understand. this young lady says there was an attack on the school.
we don't get many presidential assassins.
well, actually, it's the same, but longer. i think it's better. more...raw.
your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in lhasa.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
just find the girl.
well good.  so you're human.
what now, sir?
mr. schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until monday.
you should have let me hit him.
i'm gonna tell you something here, and i hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. i'm a little afraid of heights.
the doctor'll be back in a minute.
what do you think?
you don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
no.
you gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
i can think of nothing nicer. it's very kind of you to invite me--
something like that.
bainbridge books.
please, sir.
i've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
promise me boys.
this isn't a game.
i feel the same, sir.
what do you think's going to happen to us?
what do you think you're doing!
don't know what line morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- i'm a hustler.
what can i tell you, louis? after nam i didn't want to think anymore. i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
knox, i don't believe this!
and it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you.
you alright?
i trust you, bill.
don francesco.  you murdered my husband, because he would not bend. and his oldest son paolo, because he swore revenge.  but vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  he never speaks.
better take care of it. store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. goodnight.
they're not delivering.  i'm going to go pick up the pizza.
he can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  data, is it going to pass near any m-class planets?
now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. the more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
seriously?
how about some evening clothes?
aren't you going to answer it?
i'm gonna propose.
how much?
it would just be helpful to know.
didn't we play this scene before?
ishca baha - the water of life. i went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. have you ever been to scotland?
are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
i guess mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
no.
gentlemen, the past.  unfolding before your eyes.  stand back from the field.  it'll blow you to bits.
other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
your grandfather's here.
yeah, its really different here.
i'll see what i can do.
i just think, like, he hates me. i really think he wants to kill me.
he was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
what happened that night?
so it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
fine.
i'm on the move -
and you--
carlos had some great rock.
well, it's a wide range of, eh --
no, they never did turn me into a toad.
*                     cbs said they'll give us four minutes.  they thought the russian was a nice touch.
parsons school of design. i knew growing up i wasn't much to look at, so i put my energy into making things that are pretty.
you'll not need that again, georgina.
miss rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
but real. this is gritty. like cassavetes.
yeah, claire. she said she was fired. too bad, huh?
not for strangers; for my country.
hey, did that guy harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
it's so pretty.
what?!
look, elvis, he is hauntin' me. he doesn't deserve to live. and i do want to kill him. but i don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
well, when do you get paid?
you had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
how long have you been up north?
you got three of the fuckers. all dead.
help! help! help! help! help!
are you angry with me?
i know i give him four threes.  we can't let him get away with that.
he left!
...i gotta tell you, fink. it won't wash.
the good outwitting the bad.  it's like birdson had a split personality.
how much of a nothing? not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
sun... day. no sun... night. you understand?
how far did you go?  was it cold?
i can talk it over; possibly i can get the money. when are you meeting the man?
ya got the car?
who the hell knows?  he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
the world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. unfortunately i find it much more slippery and elusive place.
just go check the temperature.
she knows arnie metzger.
yes.
i don't know.
how's the name search going?
assault with a deadly weapon.

so, is everything okay?
i wasn't expecting this many of you. i've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
shit, john!  what the hell were you doing out there?!
he did?
not by a long shot.
what will you do when the money runs out?
go for it.
i'm sorry.
yes.
a drink with an umbrella in it....
a plaque?
it's not him.  it's <u>them</u>.  i can't live like this.
when i get the black pearl back, i'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
how're ya doin', max.
it's just the strain again, the stress. we'll take a vacation.
you could have called me yourself.
hi.
jessica, can you drive me home?
'fuck me hard!'
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
this place is dirty, doctor.
thanks, patrick.
i never did this before . . . i have to tell you.
don't matter. first time i'll be late in nine years. no great trouble..whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  the world is in this room, baby. this is all there is and all there needs to be.
go, chief.
the same size?
you'll forget him, sugar.
dear old bert's settled everything.

what do you think you're doing?
you have grown up very good.
i'm not just giving those tickets, baxter -- i want to swap them.
you won't be needing his largess, rhode island is already committed to your appointment.
you know, i hate to be crude, but i'm gonna have to take care of some business here.

what the hell? what kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
she's probably ten years older than you.
well i just want you to be impressed with what i <u>do</u>. i want you to respect my mind.
friedman’s dead... they killed him...
jesus, frankie, i'm your brother!
don't you know, you can't hump the bogart.
there's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  you stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  whether or not you feel lucky. one "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  well?  do we go on? immediately:
she's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
what does that fucking mean?
but i don't want it straightened out.
no more than this?
you know what pisses me off the most?
never?
how did this... how did i let this happen?
we had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but shelly made them see the error of their ways.
that's paul owen.
i don't know.
you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
well... try the headset.
come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
what? you want the plaza? don't be foolish. here. take this, too.  this is my place on prince street. it's got my phone, everything. call if you need me ... but you won't. everything's gonna work out. you just get outta town as fast as you can. the new york police can be effective when they want to be.
we were just going to bury him when you came along.

anything else?
something i heard someone say once.
i don't know.
what?!
i can go. you don't have to. you don't never go.
too late for what?
not everything.  why do you think she's really here?
stay here with me. me. me. me.  and kevin.  that's selfish, huh?
this is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
mr. white, the next number, please?
well, why don't you use them?  when you come home, don't go by miss gulch's place.  then toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  see?
it depends.  if san antonio sweeps sacramento, we could start there. or phoenix.  or depending on indiana- clevel...
h-h-how's it g-g-going, mack?
i love to get pie after a movie.
you must have a girlfriend.
your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
money problems?
sure, why?
snapped.  buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and i swear to god she went across the room.  perm over heels.
yes?
i'd better go.  i gotta get up early. go over to my parents'.
she threw a punch at a man on the team.
we're supposed to be asleep.
naw, i ain't.
i am wasting away and i cannot die. and i cannot live.
life knocked me back.
are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
yeah. we went to harvard together. 
what was that?
fucking hell...
help?  i've seen others "help". somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
where does one man get all this junk?
maybe you can help me. actually, who i'm looking for is a friend of ours from detroit. clarence worley? i heard he was in town. might be travelling with a pretty girl named alabama. have you seen him? are they stayin' here?
when i was fourteen.
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish. a willing, billing, lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish. be my most tasty little dish! be my most tasty little dish!
curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  mother's love, jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  it's bad luck!
you knew the whole time, didn't you?  when you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. didn't you?!
propaganda. we've been had.
he had his palm print on the weapon.
oh, did you -- care for the poem, mr. burns?
what's the matter with my brains?
nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
--stop it! stop talking about it! i'm gonna freak!
you're smart, ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
why?
what'd you say?
no what?
your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
forget that. come on. got a little surprise...
no.
as the wife of one of our party.
you trust him.
where's his boat, then? where's his crew? he ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
good. i think you're an asshole. no, let me correct that, an immature asshole. which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and i'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
can we trust him?
we didn't have sex.
i already have.
now this is where we keep all of out meat.  you got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  you got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  do you like lamb, doc?
i think maybe we oughta...
the professor might have everyone else fooled, but i know who the real brains of the operation is.
i've never treated you like a whore.
be a professional. if you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
yeah, that one. somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
some of it.  denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
but, charlie --
i know.  they cut the hardline. this line is not a viable exit.
roebush! that's  the guy! buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is special order! he said he had to have it before...  omigod!! what's tomorrow?
this?  this is you only weapon? your puny faith?
it must have been once too often. i think your brains come apart. what you got up there, chinese bells?
these rooms are yours.  up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... michelle.
and then we get here, the castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
her son drowned.  she brooded until her mind was affected. all the houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
that was kind of a rotten thing to do, anne. after all, gallagher is my friend. the least you can do is be courteous to her.
there's nothing in this hall. someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
captain?
something tells me you don't want to be on tv, friend.
oh, and could i get a quart of wild turkey, two fifths of baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
i told you. it's the down payment. and thanks to you it's overdue.
do i have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
no, it's different, honey.
it's a beautiful picture of her.
you've asked why i stay a bachelor? there goes the best reason i know!
this is kind of a cool place.

i'm telling you, nick, no one's going to come.
many things...
prnceton.
i never heard of him.
okay.
okay--i mean--
no.  and he ain't been eating so good, either. he's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
reggie -- please believe me!
he always was opinionated.
that was dr. judd. he was phoning to say that, jacqueline is on her way here -
...no.
we could reach it on fire-mares.
please. you're in danger.
everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. i am a traitor. when i kissed you i betrayed the russian ideal. leon, i should be stood up against the wall.
yikes -- i was hoping to wear this thing to the halford's friday.
sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
i did two tours in 'nam...
hello, mr. connell.
uh, huh huh, this fat dude. he said we could do you. and he was gonna pay us.
why should i go?
you wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
don't leave me tonight. might kill me, too.
i... i'm kevin. i 'm here to help you, d... dave.
downstairs, i know. pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
-- well i'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words i just don't use much --
simon's home. i was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
you're always taking time off....
i'm a ghost.  boo.
what are we going to do?
as soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  my dad's the mayor....
look at those korean motherfuckers across the street.  i betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
yeah, you look it.
easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
raoul, what in god's name do we do if she has a gun?
that's because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
i've got to go, now.
what's that?
okay, whose window did bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
it's not modesty. i just don't try to kid myself.
hey, fella, let's get this done...
i don't wanna lift crates.
maybe yes. maybe no.
well, what do you want me to do? stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that willet creek dam appropriation around my neck. either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or i'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
my kind of people.
nothing's happened to her. it's just that i can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
do you realize i have light eyes?
you see, kayo, the good lord watches over us after all.
and i don't give a shit.
now i'm going to tell you the truth. i really came in here because i was bored stiff by the party.
one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  i'd like the chance to defend myself.  i'd like my wife to have that chance.  my civilian engineers. my secretary.
i'm going to have a baby.   michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  diedre mayfair curry. pretty, huh...?  funny --- i never really thought i'd ever ---
waddaya getting so sore about?
i'm scared. i want my mommy. i don't want to lose you. i don't want to lose...
a big one....
thank you, sir.
there must be some good people... even in this time.
no time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
i don't understand.
sure, you have my permission. but i - i just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. it's no joke, you know? you gotta keep a low profile. it's not like back home. right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. and this sheriff's a real cowboy. even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
where have you been?
... give me a break, mary.
oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? spare me the uncle tom routine. you can't keep denying what you are. you're one of us, blade. you always have been.
i wanted you to ask back there.  you know, before you got us lost.
deal with it, sweet thing.  it's important, nowadays.  you just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
what the hell was that!  what did you think? did you think it was loaded!
i'm going in, sandy. i'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
we were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  what we need is a honeymoon.  let's start right now.
oh, yes.
i've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
you'll be seeing stars in a minute, miss teschmacher. y'know?
my god.  is the audience to presume that colin and i have done her hair?  i thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
you want to know why?  i'll tell you why...  another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  i'll tell you exactly why. because you're not his buddy anymore.  because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
you know who i saw in the dress department?
my secret diary. there are pages missing.
i think i love you, mate.  how do you know so much about so much?
has anyone been by? police? fbi?
i totally, totally hate you.
what alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
i'm looking at you -- you murderer!
i'm not exactly sure... it looks close. did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
no, really, i really like him a lot.
caterer?
help yourself.
goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re-writes. it's like every five minutes there's a new script. god, and you just know this all because of stab 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
but we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  the chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
you will find a market there for this ring. i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
sonny-boy, one word?
i'm alive.
god.
how can you say that? i mean,  who said i-i-i-i said that you, i and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
i know you liked ben. i had no right to...
no.
he was interested.
i didn't dismiss you. i told you what i thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. besides, this is supposed to be my time with miles. i hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
i don't know, man. ask him?
it's okay.  i'm still here, chief.
and i really wanted some ice cream too.
pretty fun too, isn't it?
excuse me?
where did you sleep?
they call me swede.
she said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
but what about this "cinderella man"?
i've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
we prayed to god and he pitied us!
proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
...so rich?
but he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
you really do believe in destiny?
i don't want your money. you're a booger.
no, sir.
she wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
so what do you want me to do?
you can think whatever you want, frank -- but i didn't kill andrew, and i'm not going to prison for something i didn't do.
...embarrassing, shameful...
sure.
you gotta go back out there.
thank you for your cooperation.  just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
when i wasn't so miserable i used to sell pigs. begging your pardon, i was more honest than my holy mother.
now, don't let it be so long, now.
they were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  i stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. shit, who am i kidding.  i'll never pass the boards.
zuzu! what's the matter with zuzu?
just the last three weeks.
yup, that's him, that's the guy. you know what else the little creep did? he kept files, close on 250,000 files. and you know what's in those files?
finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
mrs. teasdale, i'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything i can to make up with his excellency.
that'll never work.  they'll just think you're crazy.
i'm sorry. professor tripp. maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. it just looks... really lonely. hanging there. in a closet. maybe i'm just a little sad.
i think i may have. i'm not good on the phone.
c'mon, you two... jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  we have a new world champion.
norma, this is bela -- bela, this is norma.  norma, this is tor -- tor, this is norma.  norma, this is paul paul, this is norma.
i've got to keep you healthy, jimmy. i'm counting the days. two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
yeah. i brought you some movies.
after all this time i'd think you'd know me better, meyer.
shit.
rod says the sweetest things.
where's the victory?
remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
i guess you're right, but -
so let's make another "dracula." let's make "the return of dracula"!
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. it spins off of real events. at some point there <u>was</u> a blair witch--
i got an idea what happened.
no, he's not dangerous. not physically.
shit!  shit!  shit!
-- if there's a girl, we could talk about her.
may i say something, mr. president?
oh.  okay then... lloyd dobler, 555-1342.
don't throw my clothes out the window!
we're not doing anything wrong, do you.
we'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
i get crazy dreams and i black out.
maybe i've just got the creeps.
i don't care what you say. i'm going to find bruce's mother.  oh-h...  i'm going out and find her!
are you gonna kill him?
you'll be fine, ellie. now you can be excused. go and wash your face.
that obvious, huh?
that must be interesting.  what drew you there?
we followed your instructions.
and sometimes you think you don't?! well, get away then!
yessir.  there's a report here from every state along the east coast. want to hear them?
yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
reiben, what's the matter with you? i don't gripe to you.  i'm a captain. there's a chain of command.  griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  you gripe to me, i gripe to my superior officers.  up, get it? i don't gripe to you, i don't gripe in front of you.  how long you been in the army?
so what are ya drawin'?
it's very simple.  you worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  i've just never seen it done that way before, detective.
yes. i want proof.
texas is a big state.
you're beautiful.
i saw the blood. it looks like motor oil.
well, i-i guess if you live in chelsea, that's probably first.
excuse me -- ?
before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. they're using hal for a bird dog. once they find the money, hal's dead.  so get on your radio, contact frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  do it jessie.
maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
yeah.
you shouldn't be up.
yeah.
i love you, domino.
which one's your building?
you get nothing and like it.  and if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
don't worry, i owe you a lot. i'm not gonna let us rot here. i'm gonna find us a way out.
i need this?
'63 chevy.
"we"?  you and...
right.  they seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  they're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
if you want to.
what if he wants to get out?
i never said any of that!
the adventures of tom sawyer.
you'd <u>heard</u> of aids in 1984, 85?
buddy, i am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  i just feel awful. do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while?
because with your special talents, i'm sure you'll do a better job.
... is that all you want...?  ... to watch me...?
i'll talk to nucky. get you set up like the fuckin' prince of wales.
great.
yes--
dr. gruber's not in.
that's what i want to talk to you about?
you can't go in there!
come on, i'll drive you in this thing.
we're leaving, jason. we're leaving now.
the air... the power.
why do you want to go to paris?
no.  it's my first time.
sound like ol' dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... too bad he couldn't visit that ol' wizard of oz and get some good advice.
oh.
oh sure you do ... "mcintire's department store" ... "their father dressed as prince charming." that was gorgeous bud.
captain howdy, do you think my mom's pretty? captain howdy? captain howdy that isn't very nice.
i've had it, numb nuts... how much money you got?
lotte! why aren't you at the pet shop?
frederick frankenstein?
they didn't hire peter stiller from the <u>times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
what's next?
yes.
they're not speaking. professor broom had him grounded.
i know the winemaker. she comes in the restaurant all the time.
i wonder where they're going.
what's wrong?
what on earth would that require?
is it intelligent?
a horse?
what are you talking about?
dear heart, where are you?
tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
i'm sorry. i'm not sure i understand. you wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
do you have my work number?
it's a special kind of party. a <u>farewell</u> party. do you...get what i'm saying?
of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
it was nobody's fault.
he knows his alphabet.
the only realty i see is that i'm a prisoner on my own ship. what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
you gave your word?
if you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
then why ain't he dead?
down below's stanley park. on the other side of the trees, there's a beach. you can see it.  steveston's over there. coast guard station.  there's the yacht club, and beyond it, the docks. the over on the other side of the inlet, there's grouse mountain. it's about 4000 feet high. there's a restaurant on top of it. very nice restaurant.  i'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, miss mayfield.
junior.
yes... yes. you look...
he owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
we're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. i dored.
ha...
well, we...
call me tom.
too little.
i know.
then i don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
monsieur rick?
where's the adm? where did your uncle put it?
what's this?
there's only one way to be positive.  i need to see some droppings.  i have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
we've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving east.
hey, my plate is full.
wait a minute. wait a minute. so how did it happen?
what happened?
no offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
ro, how long have we known each other.
hi, ray.
it was dead.
will you men help us stop the french?
i like to think so.
let's get out of here, elaine. let's go somewhere else.
what's wrong with me?
enough. i've got to use the phone.
i didn't.  you asked me about the card.  you're going to get us into trouble.
being as close, i'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
whaddaya think?
and after the steak... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama's picture to the wall?
woogie, i caught you red-handed.
i'd better be going.
it's unbelievable that you can do that.
you know, paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. the fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. it's going to take a little straightening out. i have my responsibilities. i want you to understand. it has nothing to do with us.
...when did you know?
this is how you see the sky?
see what?
you are so money, and you don't even know it...
i wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
with me?
his what?
oh.. oh.. oh no?? oh?
she likes to play bingo.
see, now this doesn't feel right.  when i made the decision to come over here it felt right. i had all these rationalizations... i just don't understand why will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
yero, by himself?
dr. lazarus... i hope that i'm not breaching protocol but.. i am so very humbled to stand in your presence... i have studied your missions extensively... though i am thermian, i have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the mak'tar.
what's gonna happen?
ethan...kittridge is on the train.
do you see them?  do you see terrance and phillip?
damn right. bork, we're dealing with real pros here. my opinion, terrorists... what's the scoop on that stolen unit?
the doctor thinks i am. but -
yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. i've heard you have a refugee center at the airport stadium?
you wear your weeds as well as golden armor, jack.  like a true prince... a champion!
oh - sugar!
take your hands off me. what you call me?
i'll need a room over there that faces this way.  how much a week?
i don't go there. too many party girls.
banished... yeah.
oh.  want to talk about it?
that was marvin untermeyer.
harry...
i'm sorry.
okay.  i went after him.  i lost my temper.
oh he forced you, huh?
would you be bummed out if i didn't go to chicago with you?
why not?
seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
truly - uh - splendid.
what do you want from me?
yesterday i was a thief -- but now, --
ah. fine.  it's good.  it's great.
yes. she suffered longer. she was in ravensbruck.
he found out somebody was dumping water there. that's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
my mary -- she's not in japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. she does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
what's your name, lover.
nobody really wears that stuff, paloma.
no, three thousand at least. he'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. that's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. he'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. but he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. but i wouldn't count on it.
can't tell you that, mr. gekko.
occupational hazard?
lies?
there always one kid with no bodily controls. we had this dude, jeff baxter, he was a puker. the fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
instant divorce you mean?
am i dead, louis?  am i dead?
why do you need a chain like that?
wait a minute. i'll do anything you ask me, anne, but i will not live—
he is my brother.
well, i guess you found my secret hiding place.
dad, i'm hoping we can talk about some things while i'm here.
sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
it really is beautiful, isn't it?
more to the left... stay parallel...
you're just jealous of santos cause he's sweet on me.
you know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
one what?  ah-ha!
you in trouble?
you what?
pretty impressive, huh?
it's a very moving experience, trust me.
not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
i thought i could handle it. i didn't want to bug you. i thought i could handle it on my own, but i couldn't. she's in real bad, auggie.
yes.
yeah?  well, you just struck out.  it may be a surprise to you, brad, but i want to do it the right way.  not tight skirts.  tight stories.
my mom wasn't a goat?
it's time to tell him.  it would be the right thing.
that be so, better you pinch yourself now, jack.
think this about money still, ya old fool?
ooww!
come clean with us, frank. were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
why would i need an attorney?
they stole it.
i'm in.
...yes.
shut up.
but it has. there is no more to tell.
a fighter, huh?
i don't see him.
hey, ken. how have you been?
mr. sampson . . .
jabez -- ?
it's not, baby. just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
you know better than that. we're on duty. catch me in that camaro next week one night.
so she had you in jail, in russia?
you're probably right..."people think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. nobody understood i had feelings too."
if we don't hear from him soon, i think we better go in after him.
do you want me to go on with this?
everything under control?
what happened? what did he say? did you get the job?
don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
we are little more than a sum of memories.  from them we reference who we are, where we're going.  without a past we are nothing.  this is why you are so interesting.
i um... no, i don't think so...
gawd...you're...beautiful...
fuck you.
why?
i'm too young to be so sick.
how important do you think sex is?
how charming.  but why did he not come himself?
vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
i don't know that.  maybe jon's already dead.
when?
what can i do for you?
that was nancy, not me!
is this to be an empathy test?
i think you need to speak for yourself, ryan.  but i think you're really nice people...
welcome back to vinci.
you're going to have a bachelor party?
i'm through clowning. you're all washed up. get out!
on earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire. we can handle the son'a, i'm not worried about that...
so they tell the kid to throw the world series, or else, huh?
consideration?
it hasn't adjusted.
back at the door -- i asked you to back away.
not if you're over sixteen.
well?
and there's no shame to that.  it's all the same here.  everyone has an important job to do.  we all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
i know, we had a good time.  but ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
yep.
no buts.  took a lot of heart to take that charge.
alexander pope?
no.
they need you?  a bunch of nuns?  for what?  moral guidance?  make-up tips?
what does that mean?
patrick, he's...
good luck, captain.
how much you got to see the show?
are you okay?
huh?
yes. now we know.
you broke your arm.  you were coming out of a bar.  you were drunk.
and how did it feel to be rid of him
what if the radio stops working?  christ, what if i can't reach you again?
we need to stick to the plan. head for the coast.
when they...
i'm sorry, but i'm not sure i know what you mean.
and you want a --
oh, i do. you made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
so, let's see, i've got tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the lapd all trying to kill me.  happy new year, lenny.
charles, there's someone else coming along too.
what you thinking of, hon?
my mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
i don't know. fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. i'll meet you at the station--midnight.  hello ... yes? what? ... you found a handbag? well, you're three weeks too late! 
have you thought about a wife?  a family?
shit!  he jumped!
he's trying to stop us waking the gods.
why not?
i knew i should have packed up and gone home as soon as i got that twenty. what am i supposed to do about this situation?
out the window! something just flew by!
i pay my debts.
bastard.
i know, dad.
everything go all right?
i can't.
what gives, don corleone?
well, it's not unusual in his case... sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. the brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. a person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. are you relatives?  well, it doesn't matter. we'll take care of it. he'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
i don't know.
i got my planet back.
run!
did you know what was going to come out?
enough.
i will. i will. we still have another day.
tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. but if i dig it out myself i can use it where it'll do the most good.
capture them?  well, i've never seen anything like it, so... of course i'm curious.
uh, udall?
thank ye.
no. you listen to me.  you busted me, miles. you left me with nothing! what did you expect me to do? get a degree in counseling? write a book about table linen? because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, i'm not quite ready for that.
well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
you got about thirty seconds.
ho's a fucking pimp! he encourages wendy to turn tricks. and she's his fucking wife!
you can be goddamn sure, though, i'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when i get back to baltimore--i get proof who stole my shit and i call the cops!
oui. perhaps i called at a bad time. i am sorry.
wait!  wait!  there's something i forgot to tell you.
right. friday night is yankee night. where're you from?
why do you ask so many questions? what difference does it make how carlos and i feel? feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
me? what can i do?
what are you looking at?
i can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. if it's my kid, too, then i've got a responsibility, don't i?
no, i mean they've gone. decamped.  split.  vanished.
look!
it's definitely a step back for me.
she said she did.
<u>find</u> it.
i've always loved your playing, mr. szpilman.
well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
"hi. i'm mr. edgar!"  look, mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
the hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough c-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  that slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  am i right?  tell me!  what is it?
hi, bobo.
no. i only saw his back. he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
we're going to take him over to my private office.  where's our phone?
here.
i was going to tell him.
um, because you didn't want to go.
how'd you know about the fire?
i'm not taking you to this funeral.
what about matt ?
they're not after you, they're after me.
every week --
you better take powell and carney with you --
you touched him --- and saw him...? what was he doinging.  kinky...?
please don't get off me now.
so i noticed. never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
i think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
i'm going through a period of my life where i just can't be around people.  i didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
what?
what are you doing?
not through any help of yours, hildy.
how long after that was the paralysis complete?
for a fee.
come on, pop, all i want to know is one thing.  just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  i bet it wasn't a big deal.  was it, caesar?
do you want to come in for a minute? we could talk about--
no, i beg yours. but i don't think you're right on that.
today ain't my day.
no more hitting on the head!  all this trouble for a comb?
i don't have a lot to say, michael.
it's not something for nothing, george, i took you in on this, you have to go.  that's your thing. i've made the deal with graff.  i can't go.  i can't go in, i've spoken on this too much.  i've got a big mouth.  "the fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
at least you didn't get turned down for goofy...
you're eighteen.  you don't know what you want.  you won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
god, peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. you're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
jerry's on vacation 'till monday. i can give him the message when he gets back. that was patrick and the last name--
you'll be okay.
take the binoculars.
he's essential.  without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  if that happens -
they put  merry <u>saks</u> on it?!
deploy the collector.
it'll be a night to remember. it'll bring to me everything i've ever wanted. the end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
it's alright. let me see.
plenty! about 'the crime of the century,' remember?
where'd you get this?
where are you going?
that's right.  i've moved out of my house -- i'm going to be staying in town, at the athletic club.
look -- if you don't like the way i'm handling this job --
i noticed.  i'm on the noon back. we have this thing with george's family in the hamptons.
perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
your daughter is much too hard to impress, ruth.  mind your step.
my first husband worked for the bbc.  i doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc's independence during the suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  i became involved too.  i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez. then he died, and i loots the will to write it.  by the time i was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
wait, sooze, i, i have to talk to you, 'cause i, there's something i figured out.
now, sir... we did take care of that user you sent us --
i'm not the guy, harry.
that was him.
i've read your stories.  they're fantastic.
c'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
are you playing a trick on me?
no way, get out. i'm gonna tell frank. i'm gonna tell him what you said.
fuck you, nut case. where were you last night?
why... why... why... ?
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not.
you went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. alarm bells are ringing, willy.
how'd you do out there, jimmy?
people don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
--look, when the watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
how can i give you this statement?
what's wrong with oxygen?
what are you snickering about?
the hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way.  you hear me, private?
uh-huh.
excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
hold on. ok.  look willie, it's plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
what's that?
they gave me a free jacket at the door.
the fucking rapists, man. the punks who raped that nun. the $50,000 reward from the church! remember?
you okay?
memory problems, too.
he broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "take this, all of you and eat. for this is my body." when the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. gave the cup to his disciples and said "take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
come on, relax. he's drunk.  he's been locked up for six years.
you think so?
what the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
hell, we're equipped --
who you are --
oh, hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
they're not my people....
now that's a lock.
don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
it's coming along. at the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
don't talk.
no sir...
...frozen!  so if you don't mind--!
it's not that it's hard.  i just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
drew told me.
this is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
a delicious amalgamation, is it?
nightwing.  scourge of darkest evil.
i saw him leaving wearing it.
no, my mother's .. you better stop in .. i'm just here to feed the cat.
the power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. it's not fair! i've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, i could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! but no! thirty three years of dedication and research, and all i've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
holy shit! now we know how the guest list was made up. look, these names... head nurse, ruth-ann stockard... bjorn jensen, electro therapy... jasper marr, thomas steven price... they're all here!
i need some
which ear was it?
this is only a vaudeville.
my man is deaf.  i'm going to john k's party!  neh.
starfleet has been apprised of our situation, captain.
a hundred rubles st. petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
for sure.  that's how i like 'em.
no, i said i'm never goin' to bed. there's a difference. see, the article says most people die in their beds. i figure long as i stay outta bed, i'm safe.
i will stop this car right now.
what kind of bikes did you ride?
well you found me...good work, son...good work.
i know.  he came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  he was concerned that you might find it.
so're the cowboys.  they're up that road right now, waiting to jump us.
i would never think that about you... ever... got it?
is that right?
i don't have a pistol.
hey, gabe, we're flyin' off the tower today.  c'mon with us.
do you think j.j. likes steve...?
but we accomplish the mission.
you mean--here?
if ever i saw a sign from heaven!
sure does. but i'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
his wife's?
if you'd gone with bob you'd probably be in weatherford by now. of course i'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
thank you.
can someone please tell rick that he is not the only sigma chi with a big penis?
you'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. last week i saw a purple martin. and the week before that, i saw a solitary vireo. that's rare.
your what?! your fuckin' what?!
uh, i'm brian mccaffrey. your new assistant.
if it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. anatomy! heaven forgive you. you must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
yeah!  here's a name.  this is somebody's personal tax --
commander, i have to log it...
hi. i'm here for the big show?
well...

where are the others?
okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
you know what i think?
god forbid...no, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
who's this?
fake.  he gave it to me.  now --  -- shoot me, goddammit, before i lose my nerve!
you know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, clarence?
my office.
patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? i have to go.
not really.
we don't want to go there.
did miss lawson and mr. marsh ever argue?
oh, cosmo!
president?
it's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
it throws the entire death list out of whack.  and a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  we all start over with a clean slate.
what for?
hold on, ramon! is there time to make another trip?
hon... i didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  as long as i never have to wash dishes again.
double-meaning intended, right?
but he killed these guys.
you'd hate him for the trick.
martin, i'm not connected to those people anymore. not since i walked out of a loanshark operation in miami.
...and she's looking to me for support. and i think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  je vous présente mon associé, pierre nicoli.  henri devereaux.
everything was during betty. god we were so young. why did we think we had to do it all so fast? i've never cheated on betty. not once we were married, i mean.
but you gave me a rose ...
no you haven't.
i loved you much, as king, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
open the case!
i knew he wouldn't come.
leave me alone! he's going to kill me!!
the wilder paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
he had a few birds.  i got up and fed 'em this morning.
then don't bug me.
why does he call you 'master'?
do you know who i am?
diane!!!!
carnes? wait.
i've come to strike a bargain with you.  i wish to learn the power of changing.
holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
i loved my brother. i stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. a son he never knew. a son that he and his wife gave away at birth. a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. nevertheless, i was there for the lad. i guided him as best i could. but he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. there is only one clear solution...  and i think we all know what that is--
and now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
if i did have a tumor, i'd name it marla.  marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
oh, elliot, please!  i can't be a party to this!  i'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
that's george.
i'm not listening.
put your shoulders back.
our next d.a. -- i hear bruce wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  did you get your invitation yet?
i'm supposed to always be alone?
where's the fucking money, shithead!
i've been trying to talk to him about it.  he says everything's fine, but i don't know. automatically, you know, i leap to the worst conclusions.
i'm not that sure. yeah, i think --
i never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. always. never be another like her.
not too active.
grifter huh? where have you been on the grift? couldn't been here long 'cause i would have heard of you, skippy.
for starters, getting that gold off the ship. what they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
my hair is coming out.
well?
she is lana turner.
god, you drive me crazy. i just want you to know how i feel and you don't understand.
<u>why</u>?
i don't understand...
months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
you know the law -- no liquor before noon. could lose my license.
did you handle the round, mr. wigand?
ippolito!  get back here!
it's one hell of a job.  what do you put on your passport?  profession -- mel gibson's bottom.
abigail.
what's that?
he said open it.
i can't hold on much longer!
i'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am i right?
thank you, clarice.
what.
john doe.
a elephant seal. where's mommy?
hurt her?  hell, it killed her!
aren't they?  now look at this one, mrs. voss, and --
here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
then it's done.  i must choose his replacement: it cannot be rosato.
walk away? andy, you can't be serious. how can i walk away? don't you see what's goin' on here? don't you see what's at stake?
who is it from?
yeah, i study world events. five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 american school kids. you know hqw i studied that. i went to their funerals with my dad. i met their parents.
dr. evil? i thought i put him in jail for good.
over the gold.
it's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
you're a monster.
the pace?
heineken.
quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
what's that?
well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
sally, calm down.  we're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
... i'm sorry, sir?
he did? when?
i don't like it!
your father was six then.  just like you....
none either.  it's bizarre.  it's next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out.  nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in '63.  a man who has defected once already.  it's crazy.
what?  assessing fines?
i wish i could help you, but i can't.
i don't know how you put up with him.
sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
go git it, luke.
i came clean. i told it like it happened on the boat. so what if i left out how i got there? it's got so many holes in it, the d.a. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. so you got what you wanted out of me. big fucking deal.
years ago. and it was zaltar who stole it.
he'll be back.  what would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
don't tell him. i want to be the first to bring him the news.
yes, o'reilly?
where's clark?
all i've heard, from the day i met michael, is julianne this, and julianne that...
with the compliments of colet and company!
thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
this is a war, wade.  you against him.  vengeance time.  the city's just in the way.  kill the fucker. you and me.  we'll work things out when the time is right.
nick --
i want reiben on b.a.r; jackson with his sniper rifle; beasley, demolition.
well, you'd have to keep it under control.
then it was not a sin. but what was that second thing you said, loretta?
i ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
where did you meet miss lawson?
v.p.l.?
yes, captain?
shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
i don't think those cops did iris. i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her.
if max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
the fish saved my life.  two years ago, i found out i had high blood pressure.  so my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time i felt myself stressing out.
yeah.
something tried to get into this room!
with the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
you found her.
problem is, lenny knows everybody.
don't say that!  i don't want to hear you say that!
we was worried about you, cease.
mind if i turn out the light?
nice day, major.
look, i'm sorry to bother you but i was wondering if you could help me out.
vincent <u>farrell</u>, assistant u.s. attorney.  a passenger in this taxicab, and i'm reporting you to the dmv...
and how long have you been sleeping with mrs. windham?
remember that shoe you lost...
young? she arrived here in 1888. she was 20 at the time. she was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. the whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
this is janet davenport -- i'm the realtor.
oh, fuck.  fuck.  fuck fuck fuck!  williamson!!! williamson!!!  open the fucking...williamson...

partridge?
yeah, well somebody fucked her and if i find out it was you, i'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
megan?
oh ... jesus!
no cubs over fifteen, billy! ever heard of a cub with a green flower? you'll leave cathedral then, billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  if you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
improved...how?
i think his first name's ray--i have to see him.  it's very important.
michael, are you still in bed?
and who kills in the manner of his victim.
unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
the hell with this. i'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. you want somethin'?
how do i know you won't keep them all?
you know what?
i just had a nice chat with cecile. i don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
no. what happened?
me a cop? what made you think that, mr. brandon?
how? the bridge is gone.
you just said very food.
i only saw theo drive up.
mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
you can't build life like you put together blocks, toddy.
we'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
they won't...
yes. i was there with ben.
before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. that means you, too.
broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
you've got penthouse, playboy, hustler, etc.  nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  then, there's mainstream hardcore.  triple x.  the difference is penetration. that's hardcore.  that whole industry's up in the valley. writers, directors, porn stars. they're celebrities, or they think they are.  they pump out 150 videos a week.  a week.  they've even got a porno academy awards.  america loves pornography.  anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  somebody's buying those videos.  somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  know what else?  it's only gonna get worse.  more and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  desensitization.  oh my god, elvis presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  nowadays, mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  know what i mean?  for the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  they have to be the biggest tits ever.  some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  soon, playboy is gonna be penthouse, penthouse'll be hustler, hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. people'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. there's nowhere else for it to go.
it's dragon. dragon... red dragon.
lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-b...
actually it's g. ober... gerry ober, but the guys drew in the other o, fucking assholes.
i'm becoming quite attached to chauncey - quite attached...  ... and so are you, aren't you, eve.
they miss the battlefield. i think we do too.
some boy named bandit's been givin' the highway patrol shit fits.
what do we do now?
commissioner, we both know the mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
i'm getting clear of this. if you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. gordo?
it wasn't just you, bunny.
as far as i know, he went back to his parents.
we been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
i don't know what happened to justin.
where were you?
they don't see foreign women in this market.  how much did you pay?
...well, yah. who's this?
larry, i'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
you're not telling us something.
and the lord told that man --
just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
nick, he's fine. he's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
see that. they're gone!
you were not.
holly!
we're not leaving!
we... have a history. i'm sorry. you wanted the procedure. you wanted it done... to get past. i have to finish in there. it's almost morning. we'll talk later.
he thinks this is some kind of game!
well, why not?
it was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  to your face, anyway.
you know what's happened, don't you?
at-at-at-at-at.
mr. swayzak! how ya doin'?
you're <u>sure</u>???
i'm going to be sick. where's the...
guess you like those coyote ugly steaks now, huh?
it was a great pleasure to meet you, mr. merrick.

i'm down!
but why, son of malkovich?
my last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
no, i'm not mr. dickson!
howdy do, dude.
is that so? then what's a big political boss like hammett doing in town? and a labor leader like bennett? and a lot of other big shots who are up at d. b.'s house right now? wolves, john, wolves waiting to cut up the john does!  wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
approximately? one thousand bucks.
are my seams straight?
admiral, you can't give him genesis...
are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  places where someone could hide?
so you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and i'm dead?
"yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil," but no one ever said i wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  stick out your tongue.  that'a boy. now why don't you just lie down and relax.
but do you agree with me?
third.  what you're going to do with your third.
i'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
this is a joke, right?  you just want to rattle me.  right?
the odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
you coming in?
pick a suit.
i can't lie here.  i've got to get up and trim that darned christmas tree.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. all the punts lit up with chinese lanterns. like fireflies. and the gramophone going on one of the boats. always the charleston, the charleston, the charleston. oh, you girls.
you can't come in.  they don't want --
e.m.p.  an electromagnetic pulse.
you're sure it's okay?
witch.
careful...careful.
eh.
where's that?
hey -- i'm on your side. remember that.
don't.  i'm the one at risk here. if we're playing out what happened before, i won't survive.
they're supposed to be evidence.    that's why bastaldi set this up.
yeah.
in cash.
don't even ask about your money. your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
we gotta break it open.
how was that?
you do seem much more disposed toward him than i understand, ernest. did i miss something?
a seven.
oh yeah?  well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  you know how many rules you've just broken?
you're going to be brought in for questioning.
well, i don't mean to be a pest. it was just that i was looking at you. and you look upset. i liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. and i was wondering if i could be of any assistance? maybe i could cheer you up or somethin. help make you happy. who knows? somethin' maybe.
"speaking"!  reeking, seeking, creaking... freaking!
no i don't... the host is enough.
that's a lot of ground to cover.
they're not obliged to tell.
and as far as hiding a body goes? i find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. it's absolutely preposterous. now i'm not saying i don't believe you, i'm....ambiguous. there's quite alot of money behind all this.
how can i lay hold a the soggy bottom boys?
see the blood?  pack of wolves took down a moose.  greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  i'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the president of the u.s.  stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
good. you'll load these, ever fire them?
doctors that are people can't cure everything.
i understand.
what is that to you...?
a monster. i know, i know.
poor frank. he's better off dead.
you're a basket case.
killaine's wise.  we can't wait any longer.  here, put this on.  but stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  i'll tell you when. 
what...?  do i have so many already?
do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
seriously, though: we're going to eat, i said.
yes!  yes!  the boy!  one boy!
conor, you and i, we cannot be killed.
maybe it's the tags that suck....
you know, when i came out to l.a., this isn't exactly where i saw myself ending up.
what's happening at the waterfront?
d'amour --
it's fine.
he can have my place. i don't want to go anyway.
and there's hope for you too, charlie. tomorrow i bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
what the heck is up there?
for about two seconds.
food. eat. i prepare food. i work as a cook. that's how i make money.
nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
that was very good.
attacked how?
i don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
don't, duff.
i know you're not.
i just wish you could have heard her.
five minutes.
half.
anything you didn't understand?
i don't know. i guess kids were hitting each other or something.
you should talk to elaine.  that was her best friend.
maverick.
can't.  history report.  the normans and the saxons.
what's the difference?
you know, i've been thinking.  i could teach lydia to sew.
you're mad at me, aren't you?
how?
stop acting like an infant. you're here because you want me to help you in some way. what do you need from me? you need money?
that wasn't me.
where are you?
i was parked in day parking.
oh yeah... me, too.  you want to get dinner later?
what?
you have my food in ya hand.
if you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
hell, i could tell you some stories–
neo!
it's about time i did. i was one of those guys, workaholics. i worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  that's just what i thought i was supposed to do.
what're you talking about?
we got to get movin'.
zaltar, please help me.
i love rosebud, i am wild about rosebud. i just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. we have growing children in the house.
i feel...  i feel they're out to <u>get</u> me...
sex. your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
i told them to fall back...
oh my god, mother!
about horses? i'd love to learn more about it myself. do you offer any private lessons for riders?
she was there...
slow down!
look here—
violet bick!
no.  he got tired of pretending.

good quality porn has it's place in the world.

anyone stops us going in, we're with the bowen-hamilton textile company. we have rug samples.
go back to bed.
you know, i don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... one time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... so sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
aye.  we be on a quest to set the world aright --
right, sir.
don't let me slow you down.
watch bingo? i don't even like to play bingo.
i'm sorry, momma.  maybe next time.
i'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
yeah. i guess--sometimes--senator paine must be right. sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  and if you say so too, saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
you're not smiling.
fine. fine.
you alright?
i found these. the others are still in storage.
rose. rose dewitt bukater.
you're really gonna pop the question?
the same way everyone does; the government, the agency.
christ. you didn't just see what happened. they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
&lt;&lt;don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
what girls you got here?
that was because of... the reputation the gang had.
put him in the brig with captain kirk.  spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
did you shoot the officers in question?
it's jennie. just tell me if telly is there.
me?!
you stayin' in or not?
i think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
there's no face really, nothing to work with.  big dots, that's all you'll get.
i don't think you're going to do that.
hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. get a car of your own.
if you still think i'm trying to seduce you --
it's a perfect kaufman audience.
okay, group's in session.  straight talk only in this room.
where's the rest of it?
an example must be made!
hello, tom.
what kind of beer would you like?
level with me, eddie. you ever play billiards before?
what? please? now? tell me?!
hear she's retarded.
in other parts of the world, i suppose there are other ways.
yes.  i'm no fucking good.
colonel - shooting's no good!
i could stay here forever...
how childish are you going to get before you quit it?
alan?
no, sir!
cool.  is there a menu?  or buffet?
i... what can we do?
snoop onto them...
you're kidding? what did they say?
are you angry at me?
the primo stuff is great for pain.
where is he?
when was the last time you cleaned this place?
what is wrong?
hey...
popeye.
i'm sorry...
she sings, too.
i keep the heat on.
yeah?
that's right.
this cool the heat off you any?
i hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
oh, walter.  i don't deserve you.
yes?
seems like there's more of it than ever before --
we gotta get you to a doctor.
it must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
i'd suggest a telegram.  something like this: chief of police, san francisco.  a licensed private detective named named martin j. goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  his partner, name something-something greer, refuses to give us any information. correction.  refuses information necessary to our investigation. can you assist?  signed detective sergeant driscoll, vancouver, british columbia, police. 
you don't have any idea how lucky you are!
what?
i'm fine, thank you. i had a cardiac infarction but i'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. i've never felt better.
no, you didn't!
no, but i can imagine. what am i today? a "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
lieutenant quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
when evil returns so shall we.
nothing, rose.
your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
'twill serve. ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. a plague o' both your houses. they have made worms meat of me. a plague on both your houses! why the devil did you come between us? i was hurt under your arm.
but corrado...  if something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
hold it.  can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
h a r r y...
we might as well do the towels the same way.
don't ask me in.
i'm hungry.
stop it! listen to me. let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, ok? let's just review our options here.
okay, i guess.
i'm telling you, you sounded great. you, uh, you may be surprised.
you know how she is.
ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after vada was born.
i had one there for little bit. hit didn't get old enough to play with.
nobody cares, ronald.
show off.  hey, boss tune.  "come fly with me."
things are going to change, earl.
it's not that simple.  takes money, planning.  you can't just up and go.  oh, i'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  i've just got to move slow.  pick my moment.  bonus time's just around the corner.  soon as i finish the...
good.  good.  that's terrific...
what's so urgent?   you've got me worried.
oh, you look so cute as little elvis.
why not?
a half mill on an eight to one shot. you're dumber than i thought, lonnegan.
dr. kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  the father looked just like richard.  even had a mark on his cheek.
there's only one thing that will stop the martians!  we've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  now there's no choice.  the united nations has voted authority to the united states.  the white house will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.
where'd he go?
hardapple?
oh, very much...  ... i used to work somewhere in that direction, i think.  a huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
i'm still the king!
eight years, though.  that's quite an accomplishment.
but i'm not finished yet----and your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--oh-h, atlantic, how i love you ----how i love you--
you bet.
can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
all right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  is he as good as you say?
what did he find?
what are you doing here? i thought you were done with our family.
why would i do that?						    *
i'm not fucking angry, for god's sake.
thank you. why don't you go back to the video store?
but... they're odd-looking.  they're for milk.  your mum's got them.  you must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
ooop, excuse me.
twenty one. why do we have to do this now kirsty?
mary robert.  i'm... mary robert.
brad?
i'm sorry ...
oh, denby--have you seen sally around?
naw, it's all fixed.  i also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
huh?
what?
you almost sound like that guy from there's something about carrie. ben. ben damon.
mmmm...
man, that one made me puke!
the washington post.
how 'bout this billy snow?
so what did you say to my parents on the phone?
please revel with me, aramis, i need my spirits lifted.  i'm old, i'm weak, my strength is gone --
so you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
hey.
wasted?
what do you mean?
listen...the heart.
k-a-n-e. one strong syllable. kane i
just tell me.
i know, you like to make a big entrance.
i'm afraid that's impossible.
old building and loan pal, huh . . .
what's up? jess ready?
cut out the guff, schulz. we're on to you. you know everything that's happening in this barrack. who's tipping you off?
i was six years old the day pesky hesitated throwing home and slaughter scored all the way from first. that's when i knew the red sox were my team. pity and terror.
mornin, sister.
ha, ha, oh, i love you, too.
i'll give you fifty cents.
i don't know. tuesday?
chief, base.
no. it was someone else.
to paris. paris, france.
it'l take months.
is that for me?
vegas has been my town for 30 years.  i crawled out from under the first rock. do you really think you can intimidate me here?
you want to go back to shuttle work?
can he smell the difference, eh?
you know the other day, you asked why i came back?
excuse me. i have something i'd like to discuss with you.
hey! that's a prototype!
meeks is probably in rio or someplace like that by now.
you usually don't work on sunday, major?
go ahead.
um...okay...
oh. so. is -- is your friend crabtree -- is he -- gay?
oh, am i glad to see you.
no, i meant lose his family.
you can't <u>do</u> that, i won't <u>let</u> you!
his girlfriend?
okay?
bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
oh, yeah.  i didn't really know my dad...
look, eric it's your little friends.
he knows you, man. he knows all you want is to move up. that's all. a smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. but a guy like you? knowin' this is your only chance? waitin' eighteen years?
believe what you saw, matthews. the dog was dead.
grant, our miniaturizer can shrink anything.
what?
is it a rex?
we could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
i can't believe a person could actually live like this.
what?
i leave it to you, mr. deeds. can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
but what if something extraordinary happened?  something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  someone whose confirmation of phillippe the king would never be questioned.
yes.
i'm glad ya come.
i think you're a louse.
you hungry?
unreal ... so, you're looking good. whatcha doin' these days?
uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
we're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
so could you!  is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
i think it's my safest bet, don't you?
is callie still around?
i told them ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
he's holding out on you.
door to the right. get up and run.
you almost went over your limit.
what did he look like?
melvin... i'd like to know exactly where we are going.
roger that.
how's your uncle?  i hardly ever see him anymore.
hi, patrick. i thought that was you.
-- what could he have done to warrant that?
yes, doctor sheppard.  we called you back but you weren't home.  we have the book.
we caught another kraut alone in a back lane.  your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  that's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  the face turns a curious shade of avocado.  i must ask the doctor why that is.  at any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six krauts who were carousing there.
what did you do in asia? is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
was chancellor gorkon alive when you first examined him?
you've made your point perfectly clear, mr. kane.  good day.
... when i don't. it comes down to one thing, mrs. peel. trust.
i offer you my body and you offer me semantics? he's just a boyfriend, dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why i came all the way here from ohio, i'm about to become single again.  and yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which i'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. you ask me who i choose, i choose you.
don't worry.  i could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  not with the spectrum of antibios i'll be shooting into you.
i don't know about you guys, but i'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
...well, you know me, amy, at least better than that that dame does. do you think i'm an imbecile?
i was never - i was never your guest at the tangiers.
yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? i mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts?
what for?
mademoiselle gautier--or whatever your name is--i thank you for your advice, but i must ask you to go. you've got your money--
i tried to save him! i was desperate to save him! he was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
you're the asshole, buddy.
and what?
where are you now?
i gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. also, i told him i'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, i'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
if i told you once...i told you a thousand times...
well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
she trusts you, john.
okay! okay!
you said that two weeks ago.
blackjack?  i don't understand--
i guess, yeah --  oh shit!!
a couple weeks. that's why... that's why i had the gun. for protection.
yeah. and it takes them either too long or too short to come. have you ever had someone that took forever
that's proof mary was here!  it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
ollie.
oh, it is, it is! death's terrible.
rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
very good.  spoken like a true psychologist.  when confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  what is that masters and johnson?
if it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. even when i mean 'em, they don't come easy.
boy--
-- breaker, breaker. this is banana peel.
but the romulans abandoned the plan.
last night.  he came to see me at my apartment.
well, i guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
hey, willie -- i think you better get out now.
you did work for emil, right?
during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp; as a japanese-american, i had been put there and watched over. i found refuge with the clock people, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains.
... and then some.
you're goin' a find me dead one time.
i wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
you be our guest, jack.
do you guys feel like painting?
what are you talkin' a- ?
don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
like hell you do.
they're watching us now.
that's what he says. i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  there was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
it was more complicated than that. there was a reason.
i was thinking, antigua, maybe.
i'll go and get my valise.
that's all.
what makes you interested in becoming a hare krishna?
now. you say the driveway's on your side of the house. so i guess you don't sleep in the same room.
i'm so glad.
keep your eye on that brass ring. don't let anything side-track you.
i thought i loved her.
that poor girl is in a tough spot.
-- violation of the major crimes act on an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of instigation. i know that.
would you like to learn them?
he's all yours. and i'm not your partner.
i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. it's going to get you into trouble.
please.
to the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
fuck you.  you got no right for this kind of play.
i mean it fixed itself.
we don't need the lantern.  the place has electricity.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
this is a complete disaster.  i wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
he's the one. you too. i remember. he was in a hurry. just a face job. dark hair, i said. then he killed doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and i ran... i ran.
happy birthday adele.
now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  are you? are you? how about you, nolan?
wheelchair accessible.
always?
that... that was a different matter, i... i was tricked.
there’s a reason i always tell that tony pee-pants story, you know.
did you say something?
vickie, open up. i need to come in.
what about us? i'm moving away your staying here.
it is not.
we've got to get him out of here.
did i miss anything?
god, your sister's really hot.
no problem. thanks for letting me crash. it was the best sleep i've had in months. i used some of your soap.
who the fuck is this?
i see.  the verdict, yes...
thank you, dad, i got it.
mister rasczak ?
do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
what!?
"in washington..."
god damn you!!
eve, child! how nice of you to come.
i don't drink coffee.
how much more a month?
you, ya barrel of pork lard. here piggy piggy!
i know.  perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
it's all right here. give me the thousand and it's yours.
tell us about it.
no, but i did.
and this?!  good lord, have you lost your mind?  nixon can't say this. "niggers"!
oh, no, harold.  he doesn't respond well to humor.  maybe if you talk to mother she can ...
we are concerned about more than casablanca. we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
maybe.
oh.
he wants us to follow.  the little boy...
i told him i was in the bathroom and i'd call him right back. what the hell was i supposed to say buddy, you got me into...
what's wrong?
heather, does that look like domini there?
yes.  what do you think?
we'll use the wire.  never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
amtrack?
okay.  i just wanted you to know.
in basic english, what does all this mean?
you guys seem pretty tight.
i've gotten to know someone who's famous.
easy.
no, no.  see, all my life i've done things for other people.  in high school i played football because my old man expected me to.  then my parents always figured i'd go to law school, so i did.  football scholarship.  graduated phi beta kappa--
i mean, most of the time jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'me-tarzan'ish, you know what i mean?  lately it bugs me, i guess.  merrick?  are you still breathing?
did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york?
i don't want to get up there.
you're welcome!  spooks.  so, you want to compare notes on this guy.
mm.
let's go. you're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
he called you "macleod".
now. one thing we need to discuss is timing. timing is absolutely crucial. what are you doing? anthony!
he's down in someplace called positano.  peter says we can make it there by morning.
makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
did we get it?
i would.
i still say this is no test. a catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
you become a whole other person when you're out here, stan.  and i don't like it.
how about a comint classification?  we put it on the huston plan.  even the designation is classified.
you're a considerate young man.
you know, i think you people are looking at this all wrong.  if you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from combat and torture.  of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  of <u>course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
officer taylor, how are you this evening?
what do you need that for, dude?
relationships are a bitch, here. it's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. having a woman here is asking for it.
that's why i came to see you, sir. it's that clock-maker's turn again.
oh, no, i can't let you get me that. that's too much.
yeah.
are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
you're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
bad for your health anyway.
you are.
once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. don't you think?
don't worry, man. it's all for you.
i don't know.
i won't ask again.
must they always follow us?
then where was it?  i'm sent out there... i'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
well, herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just daddy, carl and myself... and van oost.
some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
dr. halpern's taking all his...
it seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
he could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
when i thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  it wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. it was something that i could never get away from... but now, i feel it's okay.  i feel good.
where you been?
well, i --
you're ro'tin, aren't you...? there's something in the voice.  would you be his friend gal'na?  i helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. she still speaks of you.
some people who went by this way lost it.  two men and some women. they packed their stuff on horses and went on.
you don't think i'm smart enough to be serious about.
you mean he doesn't like bad guys.
colonel reed...
what's the purpose of your visit here?
i assume you want something?
so! -- he's on your side, too.
hell, you never needed to convince ashley you were me. just the dumb fucking truckers. i figured i'd talked enough about the tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
what about us? don't forget to mention us.
that's why her mother couldn't i.d. her... jesus fucking christ.
get into business with this crew, identify them.  illuminate their network.  if you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  we'll indict and take it from there...
the american assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
i can't afford stuff like this right now.
what's this about?
and who remembered it? who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
charley.
hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
where was the prostitute?  where was she?
yeah? well, what'd she say?
maestro.
passed the todd place comin' in... what happened to 'em?
is he really not here?
...oh, yeah-right. i ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
you know what those leads cost?
really?
anyway, that never use to happen. i was always the prodigy. now i'm just one of the guys.
thanks.
no.  i'm doing it behind her back.
they told me, you might try to talk me into something... you need to rest mr. parker... it's for your own good.  i've been following your story for a long while.  it's a beautiful thing you did.
you wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
but i must go here.
pinhead! don't just blurt it right out.
i believe that... ms. lewton's next.
i want to talk to you.  we met ... now, listen, don't hang up, ok? ... we met at the hospital last night.
my turn.
that's because i am the shark.
and all he <u>left</u> us:  the country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  an' that's what he left us.  that's what i said.
sat for an artist.  been sketched.
five, six-hundred thousand.
you okay, jerome?
i'm okay. i just lost my balance.
i want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion.
simon, i didn't want it to end like this. we can be friends!  you'll die out there.
...we gotta get outta here -- now.
and, nothing.  they checked out just fine.
i got a look in testa's computer. his screen name was "imelda." have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
mine?
oh, man... this is bullshit!    you can't trust anyone these days.
do you have a suit?  let's get him one.... and a cell phone too.  and if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on fifth avenue, would you?
then this is our chance.
who's the best power forward in the nba...jameson?
how did you know we'd come here?
can't you give it to me later?
yes. it would be.
the damned yellows are getting out of hand. those three ought to be in cathedral. no business scrambling in arcade...
the delfonics.
and you... are you not also afraid?
you wouldn't ever hurt mummy and me, would you?
wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. roderick used to say, "buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." but sheriff wade, he could shut you down anytime.
now, jackie --
most people don't have my kind of problems.
a sweaty-toothed madman
sir, that is true.
i don't let anybody call me that.
at least we'll have a house to show for it.
oh, no. you'll muss me.
you mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
oh, yes. i'll show you. i have much more colors at home.
you're a beautiful woman.
excuse me, agent mackelway?
doing what?
and he doesn't care about me?
do not misunderstand me. i do not hold your frivolity against you.  as basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. i feel sorry for you.
crash victim?
good night, mrs. brett!
i can't, all right! jesus, would you leave me alone? i can't make changes like that in my life. if i could, i would-but i don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
how much longer?
you want to know something? take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
right.
by the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
no way. i'm about to blow up.
the same spring we had in paris. just as good.
what did i tell you?
they still have the president, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. what do you think it means?
i didn't realise it was such a big deal.
what do you think?
who speaks that name!
well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
wade's got a point there. i'll handle the call if you want, jerry.
and yet you knew what i would o.
don't mince words, bones; tell me what you really think.
i don't have a story.
a million times.
what he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. it lives in the mind.
would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
nice night.
do you want me to say i'm sorry?
live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
yes. i lost my remote control.
can i take you to the airport?
jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  now listen, i'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  spend it on drugs and i'll pull your hair out.
that's not what you said last night.
i'm here.
here.  get off here.
well then do a good job of it! get over there, and search thorwald's apartment! it must be knee-deep in evidence.
you can go first, bob.
her name's sandy ...
i don't believe it!  i don't believe it!
i didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
we've all seemed a little tense lately...
well shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
scully....?
who's herne the huntsman?
lord, you're stubborn.
uh-huh.
oh, nothin'. i never let on to mama about dell bein' the one. i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? i didn't tell dell, neither. he was back home in chattanooga by then, anyhow, and i didn't see the point. somethin' terrible happened to him, though. six months ago.
... deborah ann kaye ...
goodbye, darling.
first lady...
if you wake first, wake me up.
maybe i wasn't there when you called.
why do you want to stop?
well, i just hope it was worth my while, mr...
um, yes.
she's rich. we're still married. we have no pre-nup.
ninja ape zord!
thanks coco. it'd be so embarrassing
whatever you girls want. it's on us tonight. sky's the limit.
he's thirty-five years old.
maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
tagged a couple of cops. did you kill anybody?
good. cos you know how it plays. six years ago, i let you go free. but the next time ... the next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
i guess it's hard working on the road like that.
this is a mistake.
i told him i didn't know nothin'. but jiggs and, uh, tony gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
you need to leave.
they never told me anything except my own role--i had to find out the rest in the papers.
dylan, come here. i want you to meet the first lady.
if things go well, i don't have to. you'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
i know you. this shari is a passing fancy.
oh!
what?
stop saying that, it's bullshit.
good.
we can get these people.  with a little effort, i really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
hey, look.  you start paying, who knows what will happen.  you're a good father, george.  i always gave you that.  but you've got to talk to her.
maybe the gear crapped out....
tell you the truth, i don't know.  i started when i was eighteen, driving for my uncle cully and his partner, gus.  they go into a bank this one time in slidell, gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. all three of us ended up in angola.
sugar-lips shapiro! frightening, ain't it?
as friends -- always as friends.
what was the part?
what should i do about my doubt, teacher?
'hell, i may as well do something useful.
a portuguese boyfriend. sounds very "cosmo."
why?
but we haven't run out of history just yet.  your father quoted hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
i have to find a birthday present for frances. perhaps you can help me?
is your security team armed?
okay, you two, have a good life without me.  i gotta go.
i'm only saying, it's been what? four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
this is <u>my</u> town.
oh, see?  this is great.  ten o'clock.
i'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, mr. deeds.
mr. arnold?  he's not answering me.  okay i'm on the grating.
how's the clock, bandit ii.
there is another way.
they went to the president? directly? they went over our heads?
you got no choice. it's over.
all this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
houston, i think we may have a problem.
did i tell you i have the worst sense of humor and i make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
i'll live...
you're a fool.  now put her back.
daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
i gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. longer we fuck around el paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
and you weren't shocked?
no you won't. you'll compromise... like always.
they're right about you, aren't they?  you're fried.  you really don't know what's going on, do you?
is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
joe...  joe...
if that knife is missing, i'll look for it in your back.
right now?
it happens.  this is where you'll be sleeping.
you could've handwritten it.
and?
and you didn't send her to a doctor.
we stand behind all our work.
you here again?
no, you're not a guy.
you're not interested in seeing how it looks.
i'll tell you everything later.
it's not your fault. we appreciate you trying.
it was off the statue.  in the club.
harm to whom?  me?  i don't think, so.  try him again at the hotel.
"over--"  you know - i can maybe understand, since i been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that i can partly blame myself. but what is baffling to me, is how, since i been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
no way.  i tell them, that old man is gonna handle this from back there.
you said.
clever girl. you're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
it's mutating... spreading like a disease.
i don't think we're being treated fairly, lois. and i'm going to tell miss warfield.
have you got a print from the hand?
you know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  a-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in connecticut.  i-it's all very...preconceived.
oh...
'see ya.
syracuse.
remember about the light you're supposed to see when you're dyin'?
king ain't gonna like this.
aw, come on, rose, i want to see what the nipple on it is like.
hello.
excuse me, sir...bowman's sick.  she's downstairs in the infirmary.
like what?
look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
it's only grief makes her like she is.
he raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
i'm ready to rock, angelo.  where you want me?
hell yeah. fuckin' starvin'. wait up a sec.
...i'm across the river. at the hotel eagle. carson wells.  call me when you've had enough. i can even let you keep a little of the money.
hi.
i'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
you're strapped into an implant chair, and i'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
i don't know.  we gotta get 'im outta here before skipper sees him like this.
the left.  it's more natural.  hey, i've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  what would that be made of?
till this opens, not our wedding.
don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
what was that?
... no...! ` kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. he touches kirk with gentleness as jim recovers, opens his eyes.
-- i don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
it's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... it wasn't that i really liked marco more.  in fact i thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  it was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what i mean.  your self-image started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange.  and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and marco seemed a bit more, i don't know, glamorous? more sure of himself?  less hard work, because i felt like i was dragging you around, sort of.  a little sunnier.  sparkier.  i don't know.  you know what people are like at that age.  they make very superficial judgements.  do you think that's superficial?  he was a clown, if it's any consolation.
mister mcmurphy.
that distortion is closing rapidly... opinion, sulu?
jeffrey. jeffrey what?
oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
i'm a little cold.
yield. i have the advantage.
good one, captain rob. he does look like a you-know-what.
but i don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. i like to pick my fillies. take you, for instance. you're my type. no kiddin' sister. i could go for you in a big way. "fun-on-the-side shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
not really. i hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, i mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  oh, i don't know anything about birds. my hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. and i guess i'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, i hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but i can't... i think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
somebody else sure as hell thought so.
well -- i am worried about the way you've changed. that was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
allo... salvatore...
not taken.
it's peter, egon.  i've got a problem.
yeah.  all over. even here in grand rapids.
you must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and kendra handle the cops.
no, richard, no. what has happened to you? last night we said --
"vigo the carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
no. it's one of the few times i feel good. i used to have to go to work and cook every day. that i got sick of.
tommy, jake respects you. he won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. but you know when jake gets set on somethin', jesus christ almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. i'm his kid brother. i got no say with jake on this. he thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
i got there early. i've had my eye on this suit -- wait, let's start over. i got there early. the idea was to try on the suit, see if i liked it. if i did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. that's what sheronda's expecting me to wear. go meet sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
[yes. many times.]
all right.  one -- two -- three -- four -- five. five hundred. be careful, honey.
no it's alright i'll take it straight.
it's pretty exciting.
you can't find it in racing forms, chick.
you're talking about complicity.
i want to gamble.
mein kampf?
him? i don't know... he can be nice... sometimes.
like you’ll find a way to stop your austrian killing you a second time round?
bodega bay? where's that?
just don't show fear.
marital problems in general? indicates possibly -- am i right sergeant?
mama!
oh.
whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
want a cup?
where're we taking him?
john: take that look offen your face and act nice.
why?
it's everybody's problem!
no, it doesn't make it right, but i stopped that creature, didn't i?
that's what i'm saying.
why not?
they kid a lot.
mr. kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. it is large and on the front with bath.
i know. you're bored already. transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
kip's in trouble
a turkish brothel.
you need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
i might.
yes, you used to do gymnastics. but you stopped.  why?
at first.  then, after awhile, some chemo.
none. he could be hiding, he could be helping sid, or could be in little pieces on santa monica beach.  any idea what sid's going to do next?
what?
that wasn't funny.
who, paul? what exactly ... ?
oh yes.  jerry maguire!  my agent! this is a fierce, loving individual, i love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
yes'm, that was it.
you think she's better than murdered man?
you're killing him!
honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
she says she's lonely...
rhah! what's going on. rodriguez's hole just got...
need to lose some weight.
was dignan screaming like, get me a bag!
you would tell me, joseph, wouldn't you?
oh, i'm sorry!
and i congratulate you.
so. you're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. you're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  you need six.
admiral, i am receiving whale songs.
i admire him. he's a force of nature.
for all i know, you're the rat.
where is your daughter?  she might be able to give us some information.
and you ain’t neither one of those damned mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
a penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
how do you do.
i called her sister, mr. lowery, where she works, the music makers music store, you know? and she doesn't know where mary is any more than we do.
will you be joining us, soon?
i won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if i don’t tell you to sit down. now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, mr lombard. 
he can be no other.
why?  why me?
this is going to drive the ante up.
not anymore.
you happy?
oh, good.
you don't kiss like that. hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in boca for a week. and then, when we get back, morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the jdl.
i'll go first.
yeah, well. the truth is one thing. when there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
what?!
fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
why was data assigned?
so. i got a question. just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. we call the coastguard.  coastguard shows up. what exactly is the plan?
you need me.  nobody knows the systems on this rig better than i do.  what is something was to go wrong after the explorer clears off?  what would have you done?
i hope it's not the oven again.
so what do we do -- nothing?
i got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. the older one wanted head of the cdc.
where did you learn how to do that?
on which boat?
would you like a glass of tea or something?
not as tough as you, huh?
diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
never heard of her.
i am.
you were rich before.  this is the first time i was ever rich.
i never said that i believed...
instantly.
well, kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but i think you'd have to say i killed old murdo. i think that's definitely the word.
i'm not sure...
donowitz, he said.
seventeen percent, huh? sounds big.
please, get the hell out of here.
...you know that car?
it's fresh air.
what's the matter dear? what have i done now?
okay.
how did you get this number?
the usual prospects. convicts, contract killers, murde...
i don't know how to begin this, natalie. perhaps it's best to just plunge in. i want to join you.
creepy guy.
you think i'd really drink that?
pino, i work hard like everybody in here.
yeah. but i thought she died.
no.
if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
hey, what do you think you're doing? put that stuff back!
you're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
susie.  it's one more show.  one more time.  that's all.
wait, wait!
you've only been playing for two weeks, bob. it takes a long time to learn this game.
let the children of the dead colonel munro go free and take the fire out of the english anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
yes, i know what you mean, but i've already spoken to ferrari. you'll still win at roulette.
all right. give me a voucher for expenses.
you don't...
what?!
no point, it'll be in czech and god knows what format. but if i'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
...has a prior commitment.
oh, no!  not tonight, josephine!
let's go.
kit give me nothin'.
steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for jasper's easter egg.
yeah – i'd do that... you could teach me.
i did not.  now get out of my way!
he's the only cat left that still grooves me.
they left. to a fortress in the mountains.
how was it?
hello, barton.
let me get up.
he's kidding.
they'll do as they're told.
half my life is over, and i have nothing to show for it. i'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. i'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
...my pulse feels thready and i've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
. i. uh.
turn the body over. there was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  these burn marks.
i was there for that shot, actually.
she told us about one.  the little sisters of the moonlight.  in las vegas.
do you know who her doctors were?
yes, well, miss ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
are you my big brave boy?  are you my brave hero?
give it here, bernard.
kind of. you didn't know?
i'm your son. and laureen's son.
yeah.  but it wasn't a group.  it was one man.
you should always look to the back too, kid.
what's that?
okay, stay.  we'll come back for you.
thank you.
yes?
i know what it is. she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. inside there's a silvery ring...
what for?
everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
i'll bet. shame about ed.
he could indeed, mr lombard. but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it.
only four more cars.
next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
kill me and have done with it.
tell me again.  i want to hear you say it again.
you think someone else caused the accident?
will you think about it?
maybe... but at that moment... i dunno...
me? why, look here, mary stone -- i'm worried about you, that's all.
why for?  them boys are real player haters.
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
he'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
oh! and another thing. i am a liar. a pathological liar. there was no day in danang, no multiple tours in nam. just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  truth is... i'm scared shitless all the time.
you know, i don't feel like playin' tennis.
you are slovenly and unattractive and i won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
my mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
no, i won't let you do it.
sometimes i wish you didn't live right across the street.
we could pass for that.
well, nobody asked yuh.
it'll calm your nerves. works like a charm.
i had to -- for all i knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
it is pankot palace that kills my village.
do you know gilbert and sullivan?
i'm not having an affair with enrique -- you know a delta gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! i just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
but surely you must know -- because i love you.
call the police. okay, that's one option.
you try martin?
all right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
i mean -- working together. just like the old days. the things we've been through, hildy.
if i remembered you.  i came looking for you.  i would've said sure, let's do it.  but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team.  why would you trust me?
i was, wasn't i?  i was john fucking malkovich!  take me back, craig.
what? now you poke me in the nose as well?
why not?
your name. and --
thirty?
if it's you, what are you doing here?
oh dear.
supposin' you was to backslide on us, luke? supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
like what? the moons of jupiter?
can we come up?
trust me, james, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
where can i meet this man?
and back with macfarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
you found a flop!
we must... get you some experience.  we must... leave this place.
well, what the hell good can we do in here?  we can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
holly.
five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
look at this:
have you tackled the great reorganization yet?
i got the money all packed.  i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. people'll think maybe me and jake went away.  buy us some time...i know a back road we can take.
who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
i don't understand....
then you were married?
business hours are over, sir. this is the switch...
'cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. that's what the letter said. he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. i thought he took care of us fine.  karl, did you really kill somebody?
we get it at work.  we get the magazine at work.
how did you, know the rest? i never taught you the rest of it.
what are you talking about? you think i invited them?
...joe.
he came to my mind recently, that's all.
go home. take her home. get some rest. not going to find anything out now.
jeremy.  i'm going in. i have to do some things.
i'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  i haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
i'm sorry, guys. i thought it was a nice thing to do.
activate lifter quads.
i'm warning you, thelma.  you better drop it right now!  i don't want to talk about it!
ya gettin 150 grand killer. ya got any plans for it? whatta ya think? ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
one has nuthin' to do with the other.
oh.
dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
then it's impossible for her to know me. in the villa where i'm at, we have a male gardener.
you know who that is, don't you?  you really don't? that's skip skipperton, man. he gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
they'll have units blocking us up ahead.
"he can't write his name or read a book.  to fool people is his only thought."
of course he does. but he might get the wrong idea. anyone might.
i'm gonna get your outta this.  just hang tight.  okay?
and not show it to me. ever again.
he doesn't gamble.
now.
well no -- not exactly -- but --
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. i don't know all the details.
it's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
he wasn't protecting me.  he was putting me on notice.
it is, billy.
eh, could i have my pen back now, please?
yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
alma i told you to...
i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  do you think that's why we're meeting.  to help us say goodbye to rafe?
never.
hello, sean.
bathroom over there?
let me use your phone.
about me?
i know.  you won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  where did you go after that?
let's see: you got victor, stud of the year, more coin than god? or reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. hmmm, it's a toss-up.
why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
what are you talking about? you were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
we need to talk.
that's not compliment, melvin... that's just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid... a compliment is something nice about somebody else... now or never.
oh. why didn't you just say so?
please, dil --
really?
why would you wanna do that?
where are you? <b> int. chevy suburban -- next </b> claremont is behind the wheel of a black chevy suburban. he pulls into the texaco parking lot.
he didn't think they were risks. he was so good, roy, he could just play with the mark.
i was thinking las vegas.  get some butts in those seats.
ellie, get the gun!  try to reach the gun!
set down in there.
for a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
shut up, goddamnit!  just calm down!
was she carrying a weapon?
yeah, it took a while before i got a chance to play it, but when i heard that song it was like --
a joint interview, eh? that might be all right. we could have our pictures taken together, doctor.
claudia, aren't you coming?
is it finished?
are you okay?
you want me to take you somewhere?
no.
she moved out.
god bless ya, rock.
five by five, frank.
got her right where you want her, junior.
mad, ma?
have no fear.  it will come out well for me.
what are you doing?
hey! i'll take the girl. i'll take the girl!
you need a cut.
there've been some complications, sir. the chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  and the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
honey, please.
he ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
you fucking promised.
why did he go that way? 
...who sent you?
just say what you have to say, woman. what other people think shouldn't matter to you.
this feels stupid.
the name's gibbons. you were saying?
where are you from, creasy?
i don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
where do you live?
no -- you can't do that.
i'm sorry.  it's not up to me.
damn right!  that's what i tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
let's see, where were we?  yes.  i was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh may 15th to october 30th and then we close down completely until the following may.
you should hope quite a while.
i love you.
i'm sorry.  i, we
thank you.  now i'll tell you why i know wynant didn't commit those murders -  three months ago - the night that he caught you in julia's apartment, he found out that julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  he went to find the man. that man was.... tanner, don't you...?
say it over and over again, leon. words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
how do you mean?
you go every night?
who have you been talking to?
do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  when i was a boy in saigon i watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  whole lives erased.  a way of life, polluted.  today, no one forces me to move.  i use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
he said he stayed here last november.
thanks.
is something the matter?
dad, i never knew you had a sense of humor.
lawyers?
i kinda screwed things up.
yeah, i suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  particularly if you're not expecting it.  you don't know what hit you.
that isn't it. it's ... the loneliness, mr. scratch ... the loneliness!
hey, dignan. how's it going?
you've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and rowan together.  isn't that right...?  they're reaching out to you, rowan!
well, anyway, i—i guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the delaneys. the delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? until grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "say, you've got the delaneys all wrong." and then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "if you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
hello, liz.
this is all a mistake. jack, please take that mask off.
i'm not hungry.
yes. where are the rest of the passengers?
where does he work?
well, don't be shy. i got the address here. anytime you need it. room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
nice breasts.
tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them i said mario should take you to the airport.
yo, johnson...
holdin' my penis... what a lovely way of sayin' how much ya like me...
okay, sister, you get your job back.
i can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given i left and never said goodbye to her.
oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  i'm looking for an aerosol love potion i could spray on a certain penthouse pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
he's the devil's child...
is anything wrong?
a lordship. and gold. that i should become judas.
maybe you want to go.
call chauffeur.  get car.
whatever i said, i didn't mean it, okay?  i get a few drinks inside me --
back where?
well, no rest for the wicked, henry.
...at all.
about what?
i thought you were tired of your business?
to that stewardess?
how do we follow a raven we can't even see?
0h, i thought so! a pick-up!  well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! you beat it! go on! beat it!
maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, i need to tidy up -- just a minute, i'll be right back. you'll wait?
the mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
of course.
what about that shit about vietnam!
i'm sorry, but i can't keep you here.
we had to.  they were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where i doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
for what? there is no water. you understand that, don't you?
well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
i can't swim.
it just seems...kind of weird.
they obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
will you come to him on your knees?
what? what are you thinking?
what's wrong, skipper?
can you see me right now?
no, no, it's not a threat, i've explained all of that.
a chip. goes in a computer.
be the eagle.  be the eagle.
once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
what...! --
how could anyone do this to joey. the best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. who'd want to harm joey? tell me— who?  -- who?
john who?
josie! josie, how'd it go? did he ream you?
do you have it in you, lee?  or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
no. have you ever felt discriminated against, at wyant wheeler?
actually, i have met someone. there's a woman i think i like.
it must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
my german's a little rusty.
ready lloyd?
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
you need to get a haircut.
but everybody is all right.
no, chippewa falls.
when will you be going?
no.
i'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
my god, we're back where we started.
i've never been treated that way, and i'm not going to start now.
no.
where are you going?
don't think so.  but they sure did a real number on your office. crap everywhere.
he's dead! eddie, he's dead! it was his heart.
i'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't i fix us some french toast?
are you an actress?
with two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as i can. then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
oh, i miss you. you look beautiful.
when i read your work i felt that you knew me.  women must tell you that.  and this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  i am genna.  how many women must tell you that.  and the script is wonderful.  wonderful and lean and visual...
i've been working on this poem for 12 years.
who will read me my stories?
then give me comfort. sleep with me tonight.
oh my.  i see you studying so hard, tom.  what do you think the problem is?
that was a dance we invented at the international sand club.
it's webber.  adam webber.
buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
i’m afraid i don’t understand.
-- but it's sunday.
miz lampert, ma'am...
well, isn't that nice? you just go right ahead and putter with your hands. that's all right. how do you do it?
the check wasn't cashed?
get the... midnight... express.
—do you?
i don't know what you are!!!
okay?
i changed my mind.
then, he must write about these murders.
he wasn't feeling well.
the question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
or, i dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
i just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. maybe i better go.
chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
seven.
yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
when are you gonna come clean with your folks?
no, it's okay.
ms. deane, you wanted to see me?
nah, accommodation address.
but i got him!  he's in jail! wasn't that the point...?!
you're some piece of work, you know that.  just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. i mean, between vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
the tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
it's good nobody is following us ...
standby automatic approach system ... advise approach control.
a similar triangle?
what do you mean, colonel?
couple of weeks... listen --
keep filming.
piglet -- ?  what are you -- ?
general, i've heard some wild ones. but this takes it.
let me do it then.
come on, come on!
what...?
it's either that or we grow gills.
i think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
okay, explain.
drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
it'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
what? what are you talking about? where?
what in the hell?
what is it?
cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. do you honestly think cole's practice of word association works?
you said you were on leave for the fourth.
i guess you're right...  that is, if the faggot in the next stall thinks it's okay!
where?
get that outta your mouth!
...about five years now.
if you do anything to my friend...
sam! why call when we can go?
don't think so.
sonny was hot for my deal, right? you know it's the smart thing to do, too.  i want you to talk sonny into it.
sparkling rocks?
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. if i understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
you're not?
relax? i ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
that was mr. kennedy.
you paying attention?  this oughta hurt like hell.
you look good, bunny. it's nice to see you.
icarus?
what have you promised them?
what i'm about to tell you is partially documented.  the freedom of information act saw to that. but much more of it isn't.  for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, i'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
yeah.  drag, huh?
she'll be out in a moment.
i'm cool, baby. they're gonna give daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe bennett's singing.
i said, 'yeah.  i'd even do it for free.'
you think that's really any of your business?
i know, but i'm not as strong as i'm supposed to be.  i can't do it.  i'm screwing up the mission.
i'm sending.  do you hear me?
what, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  i don't get this.  what about...?
you never thought of the possibility?
you live here?  ... we don't have any record of that.
hey, what's the matter?
i see.
then i'm afraid i don't understand.
still time.
it feels like breath. it makes everything move. your hair is moving.
uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. i'm a friend of your daughters; well i sat with her yesterday at the mall.
that's winston. he works here.
if it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
soap is called soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. he is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
i think i'm stupid.....all you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
damn you!
what's bothering you, huh?
dude, let's help terrance and phillip!!
yes sir.
what's up? i don't feel you're concentrated.
oh, dear. his high exaltedness, the great jabba the hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
i thought blockbuster fired you.
do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
because it's what we have to do.
the zionists aren't nazis.
a ground swell-christian movement, george, you see?
excuse me, sir?
potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, sleep, sleep, my baby -- raccoon sits in the spruce all night, sleep, baby, sleep --
no charge?
uh. okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! well... shit. okay, there's a white guy. he's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. but this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
i'm waiting for your mother.
all right then.
she talk about the boys?
he was drunk. drunk as a lord.
no, jakie, no. i-i-i-
well, you went to sarah lawrence for one thing.
maybe they're not tricks.
53.
yeah... i've made it with a girl...
time is running out.
i knew what you meant.
gee, that's sad.  don't that make you sad?
there's worse places.
he's here! i saw him! that thing is here!
i am an enchanter.
is this a fuckin' joke?
tomorrow? what time tomorrow?
that guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... this one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
sheila?
well, sure.
we're fighters for truth, justice, and the american way.
twenty-eight.
i'm driving.
marty...
please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
use the sanitary facilities, if i may.
you are not a god.
what do you mean -- sex equality?
are you my man?
i said knock it off! now as far as i'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
and how do you bluff yourself?
... but we shouldn't have fired him...
no, you can.  tell him to get on the fucking phone!
i'm not that desperate.
you are like—
call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
"coronado."
found him. kent island nailed the call five minutes ago. he's stationary.
does j.j. know how to use this thing?
that's what i like about you and me. we git along...
there are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
are you comfortable?  do you... want to move to the bedroom?
dracula?
hey, tammy, guess what happened today.
animals that -- that eat straw?
when you gonna get married, marty? you should be ashamed of yourself. all your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. i just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "hey, you know a nice girl for my boy marty?" watsa matter with you? that's no way. now you get married.
-- it hasn't been two years --
who is it?
do you wanna tour the clubs?
did you request this case?
did you find the knife, sergeant?
not great.  i've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
couple a hours.
no thanks.
he told you and you let him do it.
you want to hear this idea? it's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. go on, tell her.
it's getting quiet.
too bad you didn't have a machine.
buy yourself that island in the sun?
what is this place?
you got a hall of fame arm but you're pissing it away.
what amazes me, is sandro. he seems so calm.
i'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
oh.  well.  good.
ss'kya'ta'.
i hate to think where that puts me.  i could be her father.
we look good this year.
state of grace and all that.
there's still something going on inside of him i can't reach. so me and smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. okay?
elliot lusts after you.
this could be it!
is it japanese?
got cash.
damn, lena...  who is he?
what do you remember?
no way.
move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
we're gonna go to the next town and stop.  we'll get a motel room.  i can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  we're gonna need money.  thelma.  how much money do you have with you?
and yet here you are.  all celibate and reclusive.
you got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
that's what i'm saying.  the old ways.  the old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  the...bruce, harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...i say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. i plat it out eight units.  eighty- two grand.  i tell them. "this is now.  this is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  this is it, harriett..."
who are they?
i didnít requisition a secretary.
i know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
what are you doing here?!
you drive a hard bargain, but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you.
see for yourself.
you can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
it's not just in my head.
oh, mr. den-n-by!
ni, ni, ni!
yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
c'mere, i want to show you something.
i'm trying to make a metaphor here.
sure. got a sixteen-year-old girl.
nina?
i would make you rich.
a woman?
ah. the mating call of the blonde. the night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
well, i'm addicted to winning. i say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  so what do you think?
but, we have to make a smart plan!
wow!
i can pick out a tune now and again.
you're right. i know.
where?
me?
riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. just in case, you know, this actually --
of course. sorry. i'm such a fucking asshole.
i don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
i'll repeat the experiment.  i will hold the truth. that's the only thing that matters.
brookfield just came in.
yeah. i guess we did.
i see.  how much?
anything you say, ma'am. have a fun shower. use soap.
hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. and lead us not into temptation.
what!?
when'd he tell you?
i see. well then let's introduce ourselves, i'm damien karras.
good. now you can go for a reason.
i prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  now if we can proceed to your questions.
no, no, no, no, no.
you know how to box?
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. we'll bury him in the morning.
how can you even think a thing like that!
well, now you know... the enemy is on the move.  we haven't much time.
think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  if you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, jenny greenteeth has the answers you seek.
yes, we'd like to get moving.
but commander... the negotiation... you... you... you fired on him.
flowers. that's funny.
did you ride past casey becker's house?
on august 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
i did nothing to the monitors.
i'm sorry, i'm not.  i'm just another guy.  morpheus is the one that matters.
look at that, see... watch. wait a minute, watch. there! d'j'u see that? d'j'u see the way he... you know what that guy is doing? that guy is squeezing her ass!
any time, bro.
not that i recall.
you still think this is about me, don't you?
wait a minute...
it's a question.
i don't know.  i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
so, basically, i've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
mr. gittes?
can i help you with something?
aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
can you help <u>me</u>?
david?
how long has he been this sick?
i think jeff bridges is getting tired.
she usually is.  trying one way or another to get money out of wynant. i wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
of course--my god, you think something this big just happens? the break-in and the cover up, of course mitchell knew, but no more than ehrlichman.
that, i suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
i haven't used anything for two days. i'm trying.
this isn't just a mood ring.
i just wait. for this... it's what i wait for... i wait all year.
where is she?
you're asking me out.  that's so cute. what's your name again?
are there any questions?  hudson?
mack must think zero has a police band.
c'mon bill... you've got some sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
we just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to florida.
it's the tide. it's the dismal tide. it is not the one thing.
a do-you-think-he-saurus. what do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
you know... you know a lot of times sex gets in the way. has that ever happened to you?
i'm serious.  you don't -
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  to be honest, i don't realize...
could i ask some questions?
last night was great...
no.  i missed that.
look at this.
and that's a good thing?
the doctors were not negligent.
...me?
what would their reaction be?  i hadn't the foggiest.
as in 'resulting in death.'  we pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
it's not.
bullshit.
since the time of adams--not washington.
do what?
bobbi fallon.  bpi.  i'm producing the coke commercials for the playoffs.
that's right -- topol.
i'm leaving the house around midnight.  in case you're going to follow me.  i'm going down to johnny's club.
you really want to know?
it was very dark.
and we know which lebowski you are, lebowski.
make it 1000. we got a lot of fishing to do.
i'm confused.
what are you saying, henry?  that his girlfriend fucked him to death?
i'm hungry.
i paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
are you going to let erik wake the gods?
how about the point?
one more thing. mah wife's got this leather satchel. it's black, about this big. i need ya to bring it back. it's real important. sentimental value... any questions so far?
all right then.
yeah.
well, sir? which is it? the wireless, or benes' life?
anthony, i --
you're fishing. you don't know shit.
uh, william... uh... hendershot.
did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
that's not what you came to say.
you know, the more i think about it, this really isn't david's kind of place.
whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  if they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
thank you.
no?
how much longer?
this is what the priests tell me. his sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
bela! it's so great to see you!  and eight o'clock on the dot.  right on time!
he'll live. but it means your boy's behind it. astricky was holding a list. they just faxed it to us...
what good would it do. no matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
nothin' much.
don maranzano. welcome.
you weren't playing a joke? she woulda gone out with me?
ouch!  that really hurt!
still need a lift?
wow. hey, you look good. like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? you, are still doing your painting?
and what if i don't want to give up on her?
yes.
well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, is that your limo?
to us indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. i've got seven mothers on this reservation. sisters. brothers. you ain't one of them.
...i was commissioned yesterday in the army reserve. henry morgenthau arranged it. he's a dear friend.
it makes us feel a whole lot better.
i'm telling you right now, i'm tired of this shit.  there's two billion chinese - let one of them be your partner.
maybe forty, maybe not that much.
yeah. tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
you picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
well, yes.  yes, in fact.  a little on the outside, yes.  and there's been all this friction.
join us, commanders.  now what's the disposition of the fleet?
over here.
is your time so empty?
what am i going to do now?
you better watch it.  she might file on you for sexual harassment.
i'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
and, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
yah - how are you doon?
good morning.
mm... i wouldn't worry about it.
i have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
nobody does that single-o.
all right.  let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  me and jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
and pure --
i'm not going, john.
well, not that i wouldn't sugar bun but earl's in a bind.  they're going to take his car.
use the thrusters and you'll be fine. we'll huddle together out there.
i'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
it's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what i mean.
how can you tell?
right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  i don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  we are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  so it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. and we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  besides, i don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  i don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
look, man, i'm telling you right off the bat, i'm high maintenance. so i'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. if you want to be with me, you're with me.
what?
i'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. i take care of myself, and i got some money socked away. you'd never have to work again, that's for sure. i'd treat you like a queen.
will champagne help?
just fine.
february?
oh, jesus!! hellboy -- ?? is real --
oh, come on, shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  listen - all old houses have stories.
i been working on a few things.
"60 minutes"?
madam, in happy time what day is that?
nope.  legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
i know.  i understand disappointment. i really do.
is that right?
thanks, kitty, i'll never forget you for th--
benjamin.
my daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
she's from cuba.
do you really think we're getting anywhere.
what is this bridge?
i'm all right -- stand by to return fire! mr. scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
last time billy-boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  sad in a way. why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
how would you like to go tonight?
hey, fuck all that, i'm making a point here. you're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
who am i?
so what are you doing with your life now, son?
it's too rough.
thanks for coming to get us. little brother almost scared us to death.
well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv? why don't you start talking.
she lived there.
you're not responding to the stimulus.  i can see right here, i'm not getting a reading.
that's a pretty amazing story.
i might break you, nice guy, but i'd make you my dog's bitch. you'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy t-bone hound.
the board is waiting.
... lover's lane.
our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe jim trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
just stop right there, sally.  we've been through this.
oh, i know you, nick. i know you real well.
can i keep it?
cole...
fine. how are you?
and i you.  i think i've heard about you, mr. felson. you play pocket billiards, don't you?
what?
now wuddya suppose is eatin' george?
who else was involved in this?
it isn't that -- you said, "have to go." what could compel you --
i'm starting to wonder the same thing... how much do you know about what happened to you?
why don't you get out of my face.
yeah, great....dobchay! it will dry, yes?
'thou art then a king?'
johnnie... that's the past... we gotta get on to our future, sugar!
i'll come by.
people watched the movies in their cars?
no, ma'am, we can't. we can get a roof and a fire and maybe mrs. wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
i from dat nex' place.
there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith, bill jones. i'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. c.i.a. funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
good.
thank you.
that's fine, oswald.  but to get the mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. like the reichstag fire, the gulf of tonkin.
now i want you to be absolutely, totally, genuinely honest with me. did you really, truly, honestly like it?
he thinks i'm "sublimating".
not i —- i am alive, yet every hope i had is dead,  death can be good. death can be happy.. if i were really dying i could speak like cyrano -— "my courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. then perhaps you might understand,
come on, old friend...
you think we'll go for that last place?
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
you got a good lawyer?
no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what'll you do for transportation?
the duke?
you tight with the d.a., trash?

this here money, take my share an' ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. tell 'em half goes to sally two trees if i ain't back in a week. the rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
i know the theory behind the movement. if one believes in good one believes in evil. if one believes in god, one must believe in the devil. and an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
some things never change, do they?

i took two thousand out of the savings account.  that was what i had in the bank when we got married.
we'll start small. when we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. only sell the best stuff. and keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.

rick stayed later after school with kristen.  she wasn't feeling very well.
you can't say that....
twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
i thought so. you help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. that way everybody gets what they want. you and your kids get out of this alive and we get into mexico. everybody's happy.
what's gone?
filiba ...
you forgot the milk.
hi.
it's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.

make it official, if you like.
shurrup!
okay, so maybe i'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  you want to listen, for once in your little lives? you want to pay some attention?

big deal, i can do that too.  thomas j, you got something!
i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
good day, miss cartwright.
are you kidding?  harry had to go out of town.
the cemetery is nearer the castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the castle originally?  -- i always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  isn't there?
what?
you just go inside, homer. we don't need no help.
he's got the most beautiful eyes... the hell kind of question is that? he's a guy.

shit, that's nothing, i ran twenty- two flat.
some setup you got here.  a real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
i sort of already have.
this private assurance represents the word of the highest authority?
that one.
way to not overthink it.  so when do we leave?
you have to see her.
it's a map, i think that's what it is.
i get my own help.
and who's lydia?
aye, sir.

i'm sorry.
to look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
the design's deliberately noncontextural.  but i wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
while i was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', nicky just hit him. no matter how big a guy might be, nicky would take him on. you beat nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. you beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. and you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
i have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
now you're joking, right?
rose, tell us more about the diamond. what did hockley do with it after that?
now that's sharp. that's real sharp. miss ella mae set you up, didn't she? you like it?
sometimes i really hate you.
it was great.
-- till he fucked his parole --
give me some credit, will you?
it's a very good job--too good to pass up.  i'll be handling funding for the whole...  look, i...  ..."like" you a lot.  and you...  ..."like" me, okay?  maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
did the appearance of danny's imaginary friend...?
he's lying.
let me just keep going a while. she might remember something?
the word, sir?
no. it's all right. i just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
say, i saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
detective kincaid?
okay, well that's something.
-- well, rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. he says that your deal memo has been signed by the arizona cardinals. four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  playing in the state where you grew up.
i have no doubt that he has, your majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
melanie, melanie...
to freedom.
how old is your boy?
number three to. d.o....number three to d.o.
yes, it is.
cheer up, darling.
'eh, chief?
it's not mine.
i knew about jim.
and how many soldiers do you have?
greer and goble in the call building, san francisco.  just like you thought...two murders in two days.  different places, different methods, different people. nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
i missed you, lieutenant.
it's not bad, but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  i used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
excuse me, steve.  i said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
from the club. you didn't answer.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 's' and 'p' stands for 'special people', which is the kind of kids we are. 'a' and 'z' is for 'aren't zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
i will. take it easy.
it's not much, but it should get you to switzerland.
no... no, go away.
poor dad, does that still bother you?
i do.
my son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. so he accepted our bribe.
you think i'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  that's ezio pinza you're thinking about.  the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. he won't stop.
atlanta and birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. jimmie may in the finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his index.
mommy!
was she that bad?
she will if you think she should.
doctor mccurdy, what was the cause of death?
you see, major, you have nothing to worry about rick.
but he didn't! i've looked everywhere --  and if i don't find it --  those men going to kill me.
fuck you.
and those were your scissors found sticking out of mrs. sterner's stomach, weren't they?
well?
where are you going?
where's arlo?
yes, it must be.
out of self comes selflessness.
this meeting is adjourned.
those two big guys were tackles on the cleveland browns, and the redhead played halfback with the rams.
was this all about the oil?
colonel, i didn't request this transfer because you're my father. i requested it because i believe in this cause and this is where i can do the most good.
there doesn't seem to be any water damage. kind of cozy, actually.
yessir.

arson.
bob...
what time are you gonna be there?
italian?
who was that?
when?
did they find out anything when they questioned her?
okay. now you're really starting to piss me off!
i don't think either metropolitan or national should cover the story.  i don't think we should cover the story, period.
fascinating.
i wouldn't.
...don't put it in your pocket.
would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
yeah...
not really.
what are you doing? you don't ever criticize the feature!
ready, major.
thank you, sir. i'm sorry i embar- rassed you.
it better be up to and including me.
so there were others?
look at me. look at me, mother darling. look into my eyes. what color eyes did barbara have?
well... not exactly.
alpha.  is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  any way at all?
no luck?
hello. john triplette.
if you get out can we be together again.
then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
we are about to embark on a great voyage.
does this look familiar to you?
what are you talking about?
yes.
he's big as a bloody bus!
report.
a few weeks before shooting, i went back to bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. see, i'm italian, but i grew up in tarzana. so i wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.

he's a barman.  whatever.  do you mind if i continue?
tell him we're busy.
you found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
that isn't what you said before.
i'll think about it...
no, no, we just got her back together...
our relationship meant a lot to me, too, paul. but it's over.  and michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
to my triumph, of course.
please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
how much longer?  this is supposed to be your party.
looks like dirt.
a fed? like fbi?
okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
they could be utterly negligent. maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. have you considered that?
he always has to make the big entrance.
we'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
it cost us.
they just left, sir.
that don't smell like a more.
oh, it's a fire hydrant.
we're late.
what? we're the leadership, you and me. there ain't enough of us to...
you always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? a little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
flynn...  where's ram?
i'll get the information.
you certainly did.
daphne...
i understand.  i understand, thank you. --how about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
why you gotta be an asshole chuckie?
brandon!	time to go!
oh, but doctor. isn't this wonderful. to live -- to live -- in the grand hotel.
do not lecture me about treaty violations. the federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of intergalactic criminals. it is not i who will surrender, it is you.  on the planet below, i have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. if you do not surrender immediately, i will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
i do believe mr. mccray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
dad?
it's so nice.

an ancient japanese ceremony.
what are you talking about?
i know a couple of addicts. stupid wee lassies. i feed them what they need. a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. it's easy money for me. not exactly a fortune, but i'm thinking, 'i should be coining it here.'  less whores, more skag. swanney's right. get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. what do you think?
they were going to pay, then?
yo getting there taylor. you be cool now and i'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
the other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  i woulda caught 'em if cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
they didn't give me a chance. we had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. she seemed happy.
i like that.  but take care, mr. boone.  freedom is a drug, much like any other.  too much can be a very bad thing.
you look good.
you think that'll help?
well, yeah. sort of. nothing really mean. me and my pals, me and my brothers. it was kind of funny then. stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. stuff like that.

i can't believe i remembered that, although i suppose i should. i wrote it...  but that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. i'm flattered... i think. or frightened. what's your name?
find out.
yes, it's looks good.....we will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. the others will just be house lights.
push that button for me, will you?
it's only light that doesn't affect it.  solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  fire above him!
no way is that the same chick. the other one was a dog.
guys, if i'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
i gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?

mr. yelburton will be busy for some time.
she does.
i don't know... how it keeps on coming. it just keeps growing.
how's the mother?
i didn't say that.  i said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." that's what i said.
maybe. but i'm taking no chances.  why, this kid's got a record.
maybe you're having twins. maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
mr. clyde you're twisting things around.  i wasn't masquerading. luke trumbo... luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. i just... happen to look a little bit like him.  that's all.

mike, this is fantastic.  i mean, you're responsible for building all this.  what a job you've done! maybe i'll quit school and come down here and work with you. brody brothers construction. we've always wanted to do that together.  boat building.
certainly, general.  why do you ask, sir?
are you in love with someone else?
let me earn my keep. i'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. try to make him some cow tea next time.
it doesn't belong to you, mrs. lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
ted.
trevor i've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. this poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. so, i've been thinking, what about daisy?
what's he running for?
we'll take a rain check.
leave me alone.
no, not, not everything. this. i am the man in your life.
and the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till i've passed on. maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after i'm gone.
show me something?
what have they got that we ain't got?
what's the name of that commissar on the board of trade?
i finished it off.
she's partial to joey, not me
that's okay, kid...
that's right, fella.
what do you want from me? i did what you said.
of course i knew.
gimme water.
moving along quite well.
the front door slammed.  someone went out.  there's a different car starting.
i've got to go now.
man! it's gonna be one hot muther today.
whoa. whoa. have really loved me? letty, it's natural to be nervous. but we're going to work through our problems.
just in time, too.
it was a long time ago -
we?
i have no idea.
ready?
...is everything okay?
oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as i wanted you too.
you're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
jefferies.
i know, but --
what have you done to me?
--yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
your mother was blind?
you've never actually met truman, yourself.  never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
please?  i'm dyin' of thirst in here.
namely?
in your pocket.  give it to me.
yes or no, daniel.  if i get him, will you let me go after foley?
no one's trying to buy you, willie. it's important to know why you're telling us this.
i am listening, my son.
what does it matter? women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. they want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  and then they dump you.
spooky.
we didn't even really have it.  i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is "don't drive drunk." i was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
what are you carrying, willy?
or just hell-adjacent...
hi, spats.  we was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
me either.  i tell you, i used to be with a mining outfit on callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
we will assume full management of the colorado lode - of which you, mrs. kane, are the sole owner.
could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
fifteen meters.
-- a muncie girl! can you beat that!
i feel like we're making real progress here.
i did my homework. your grandfather was a peach farmer.
this is suicide.  go get the police.
things so bad, nobody can help -- not even doctor maxwell.
no, i didn't.
no, i just promised myself i'd give it a try. i gotta get out there sooner or later.
i'm josie. aldys is an interesting name.
that can't be...that's not gonna happen.
you want love on your own terms, don't you, charlie -  love according to your own rules. and if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
i understand.  there'd be no point.
i wish i knew where you went at night.  did you toilet paper the johnson's house?
yeah? who is it?
will you call me later to talk about asking walter for the shrink? and we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
uh, this is our paleobotanist, dr ellie.....
charlie!  i said, what time is it?
ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... it's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
i didn't say that, sid. but you know there were rumors. your dad was always out of town on business. maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
okay. 
when?
i've got a gun here, sir. it's always a good idea to have one around.
tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  not near ready.  not by the longest shot.  aaron's spent six weeks in tripoli, he's interviewed gaddafi -- he reported on the eight-one story.  i think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and i think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
are you by nature a sadistic person?
it must be about that appalling script of hers.  what can i say to her? what can i say?
you must value your independence.
yeah, but –
my daughter, i ask only...
no. i consulted it. we're going into indian country, i wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. don't you?
unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet msl, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
this is from three years ago. some difference, huh?
who are you waiting for?
help what?
right here. a minute ago.
sorry about that, mrs. heine. shall i repeat the ques...
you have to focus.  there is a phone.  wells and lake.  you can make it.
you liked it too.
he wanted me to leave dave and marry him. last friday i told him it wouldn't work. dave would have killed us both!  he followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  i had to tell frank i couldn't see him any more. it was getting too dodgy. that was on sunday.  he said he'd kill himself. i was frightened what you might do.
chair, cup and ball.
okay... make nice and give us the ray gun.
he's from southie? how many people did you try before you came to me?
so long, cactus!
i took the padlock off your door. what more do you want?
what's that?
a decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
did you know her?
u-huh.
drug evasion with assorted perversions
what are my choices?
joey cicerno.  dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, ivan petrov.  both of whom were in bed with dmitri.
you were right.  there's a part of him that knows the truth.  about what he did, about himself.
he didn't recognize me.
sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
is this a bad time.
i bet you come here on a saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
edward, i can't.
ray, you saved my life. are you okay?
yes john?
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation.
it's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
we been through this before--
i want you to check this out, ellie.
sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  forty thousand dollars?
wonderful!  why, if our scarecrow back in kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
i want to be dead too.
i spoke to your father the other day.
have you told anyone that i'm here?
come on!
...don't do it to me...
this ain't no laughin' matter, everett.
hi... am i late?
is alyssa home?
cool?
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
after our talk last night i took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. knowing how difficult it is to get into soviet russia, i thought i might be of some assistance to you.  may i introduce myself? i am the duchess swana of russia... another russia.
yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, mac.
nussing!
another rough night, huh?  that it?
the systems integration site.
well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
hmmm, it's soft. it's awful soft.
let me tell him. when he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
he never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside nicole.  he looked frightened.
how'd you like that course?
motherfuckers...
yes.
he fled. they still can't find him.  my mom and i had to change our names and stuff. i thought gretchen sounded kind of cool.
what the hell?
i just realized something.  we've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
but not now?
up to six weeks, i think.
so now you suddenly care about my future?
from now on, we'll share marla. we've been spending too much time apart...
whattya mean?
not for me.
and reverse the mutations --
oh, good.
where is everybody?
we don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
this is matt hooper...
the right way and the wrong way.
tough luck.  you'll have to split the fee.
a little less than yesterday.
she's in philadelphia seeing linda aahby. the neurologist.
well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
ah... no...
suppose i go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  how's that?
this is a hot run.  beat it.  you're late.
calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
you'll be better off without me. i ain't fit to live with no more. it's just like a lynchin'. maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
if my universe had a hub...
we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight -- the first major event of the bicentennial year... a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. i would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- jimmy michaels.
is someone in the room with you?
she's from connecticut. she belongs to his stupid country club.
because...  ... you love her?
that's it. you get it quick.
eddie, i wanna make another picture. when are we gonna make another picture?
how nice.
o'connell! i am going to kill you for this!
naturally, dave, i'm not pleased that the ao-unit has failed, but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. i certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
yeah, well... i let him stay there. what else could i do after such a tragedy?
why worry? you'll like it. nothing in the world like a mace high. forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
where do you come off to make a remark like that?
for nicholai?
and what?
mad! darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. i love you for some of them - and in spite of others. i haven't let those become too important to me. they're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. all right. but you will not sharpen them on me - or on eve...
it's the white house.
no, no, the opposite.  that's my best friend, michael o'neal. he sounds desperate to talk.
i just heard. who is he?
hey... i never said you was a pussy... always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
some say you are, rocky.
no!
it's not like that...
what's the reason? give me a reason, tom.
...why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at trader jon's...? come on, man. you're about as close to being officer material as me.
you found nothing?
you mentioned that in your letters
one thing that has been troubling me. that lamp at the diner. do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
i'm sorry.  i was too late.
good evening, comrade.  this man is horribly old. you should not make him work.
i love christmas in turkey.
that feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
good morning!
not really but i'm probably not a toffee maker. how would you do those lines of mine?
man, act like this is your home.
this is to replace the bike i lost. i'll get you the rest.
well what're you down about? you mean because you didn't get me there?  you can't expect that. i mean frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a john.
but i was dusting.
no, mrs. lampert.
you made him strike out. you wished it on him. you want to lose. it's too hard for you to believe in something. it's hard to have faith. it's hard nwork to trust somebody.
claire?
no i don't.  i don't take orders from smurfs.
bloody hell...
that's right.
how can you say it?
goddamnit!  d'you tell him we need it right now?
commander, i must speak to you. it is a matter of supreme importance... we are thermians from the klatu nebula, and we require your help. i beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. a great many lives hang in the balance...
you got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
his wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "there but for the grace of god"... eh, doctor?
it makes you tell the truth?
he's gone to stayin' over with that wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. i think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. but he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. everything's worked out good.
just a minute, joe!
c'est bon, monsieur.
interesting suit.
but i have had much practice.  as a child in the west, a platoon lived with us.  they'd let me play with their weapons.  the scabbard is so beautiful.
yeah watch the fuck where you skate. you know what i'm saying?
will you have dinner with me?
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
pour your own trouble, will.
"the country is at war." 
i'll go up.
what are you talking about?
i'm sorry.
... sheets.
i used... i used to dream you were alive... and then i'd wake up and lose you all over again.
yeah. he's a respected scholar. even no-am chomsky says he --
jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, i can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. you have only to drink a little.
go on with your dream. what was it that frightened you?
how fresh is this coffee?
billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  they always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. it comforted him.
...this, uh, this commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the rothstein application.
are you listening?
faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. i got to have trust.
don't forget, you owe rick's a hundred cartons of american cigarettes.
well, it looks like we both lucked out.  i just met somebody myself. somebody my aunt introduced me to.
well, w-what happened?
where's catherine?!
tell me.
i hate him.
how'd you spell that again?
don't you ever get tired?
well, take a look around the house.  is everything nice, but not too nice?  are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  does he give a lot of gifts?  do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
why?
no, thanks sheriff. i'm leaving town tonight.
i can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. that's why i need you, case. you're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. my "ice" as you call it. i'm doing everything i can to make that possible.
ask me what i want to change about this moment.
what?...
give me the district attorney's office.  i'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the state penitentiary.  hello, d'arrasty! this is hartwell. come over to my office, will you? i've just arrested a couple of important birds and i want to take their confessions.
what i mean, when i say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. it is vulnerable and endearing. and that is annoying as shit.
does he know?
i've never heard that he...
we will never 'evacuate', captain -- this is our home. indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
i'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
didn't have a choice.  my car overheated up the road.
it means who's side are you on?
christine!   mister van orton is a valued customer...
is that bandit in the lead?
come on, i thought we had fun, rich boy --
i admit it -- you are better than i am.
she can't be here without me.
we all are, data. but we're going to get him back.
what kind of light?
nothing.  why don't we walk to my dorm?
and then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
just one, compadre... kampai.
how camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? the garden walls are high and hard to climb, and the place death, considering who thou art, if any of my kinsmen find thee here.
i just did a movie about bob yar, i played gittle, the jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used shostakovich's 13th symphony.
dr. towler; page 406, 'contraindications to general anaesthetic.  ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  does that sound familiar?
yes, it most certainly is!
oh yeah! i saw you in the newsreel!
i was your choice, dr. lecter. you chose to speak to me. would you prefer someone else now? or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
here we are, harold. oat straw tea and ginger pie.
and him a brain.
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
i beg you, donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
i...
vegas? what'd you think?
oh, jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
looks like a chipmunk.
he will be odd, different.
the ship is under attack...! man all defensive stations...!
now what?
other ships, yes. but no experienced commanders. captain, i need jim kirk.
discretion? sir, i am a man of the cloth.
i thought everything was arranged.
well we know that but what's he doing here?
he said what?
i'm supposed to fall for that?
i helped him cook the books, ed. i did do that.
like what?
smoking is bad for your heart, michael.
you know i feel ridiculous i didn't mention them yesterday -- i clean forgot -- ridiculous.
are you going to make this hard for me?
i don't know what to tell you, sir. he's been gone this whole week.
c'mon, just do it.
but it's impossible.
bet you're pretty handy around the house... can you cook?
i wish i knew.
he looks like he can take care of himself.
the line's over there.
ain't seen you in a coon's age, johnny.
i'm thirty-seven.
i'm tired of always playing the cops. i wanna be bogart sometimes.
i've been watching. we were fine 'till she came. she brought the devil here.  there was blood on her hand that night.
that there frank burns is a menace. whenever a patient croaks on him it's either god's will or somebody else's fault.
i, uh... i was... attacked. walked in on people robbing me. i was hospitalized. i almost died.
that must be four thousand yards.
details, pokrif. from what i saw he had an incredible body.
i thought you were out of town!
the guy with the transplant.
any news on my wife?
i guess skipper neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the academy, didn't he?
any word from canada?
how's zander?
...i can find a place tomorrow, then i'll be outta your hair.
i was six years old!
this is like a major disgrace.  forget m.i.t. or stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
so you’re not at a non- profit firm?
i agree.
quite sure. i find it just a bit too - too "seventeenish" for me...
who wants true? who wants moving?
no.
no! fuck you! you start getting excited! we gotta fucking go!
can't you pull that stocking down further, kenny?
nothing wrong with being a waitress.
will, i can't believe you brought skylar here when we're all wrecked. what's she gonna think about us?
'love'?  oh, man, i've got troubles of my own.
what?
as my wife testified, we were considering it.
have you seen the oasisburg police? they drive golf carts with little red sirens.
sal, just do me a favor, leave jade alone.
she believed you?
you resented the fact that she told you what to do in mr. marsh's house?
their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
why do you say that?
which two?
call me les.
like ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
it took you long enough to get my ass out.
well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
well, think about it.  isn't it possible?
why?
less neurotic.  are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter s and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in america after all, can be a very expensive proposition ethan.  so, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
i know you don't. that's the point. i'll say no more.
<u>auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
there is nothing.
yeah, god she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
i work for the government.
i don't know how to say this, jeff, except to just say it right out, so i'll say it. they do not want to air it.
i'm looking for someone.
chigurh. anton chigurh. you know how he found you?
i thought he said by the monkey house.
i've got to run!
scared?
thanks, dad, this talk helped.  will you sign it, please?
fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? who the fuck are you calling?
jessie?  looks like your friend found company.
higher mathematics.  two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
i do not!
grigory -- that's russian, right?  thought they were on our side...
think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  these chicks do it all. they insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  he's led a very sheltered life.
heather, what is it?
what's the matter with you?
simon, i'm going to check rok's secondary readout unit.
toy?
get some internal police there. tell them to run a perimeter.
what?
on the house.
no, stay.
i thought you were living in san francisco. or was it nepal?
there is a kind of shark called a great white shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
great line.
something like this happened in santa cruz last year. the town was covered with seagulls.
i can't believe the price of these fleabags.
everybody did.
... i've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... i've known success... and i've felt love... my associates, chauncey - i've talked with them about you... they're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... i'm very fond of you, chauncey... and i understand eve... tell her that... tell her i'm madly in love with her...
fabrizio said you might be up --
you can save it for the jury, charles. i want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, i'm a bad lawyer.  gentlemen.  counselor.
mapping the fucking pig genome. we'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
look. go on, look.
no, no!  that whole thing!
it's changing characteristics.  it's solidifying taking on weight.
i'm sure she is, james. but i'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
so what are you bringing me?  looks like you got some film cans.
that's three games to none, carl.
my end?
to lunch, you say. i am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. we are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
on the nine o'clock train. that's the one he took, isn't it?
why do you always use your left hand?
good answer.  same goes double for me.
lasher touched you and you loved it.
sure you wanna do this? might be a way they could track us.
ever do this from a jet?
donald segretti?
you go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. you need six.  six is me.
around twelve-thirty.
that nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  that's why moving wit'cha uncle elroy and cousin day-day is the best thing for you right now.
come on.  let's get a drink.
you're drunk.
sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? if you do, why don't you give me a call. i'm in the book.
she's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  i'm just helping her conceive, man!
that's why i married you.
we have to talk a little business. i've just been on the phone to los angeles.  barton, capitol pictures wants to put you under contract. they've offered you a thousand dollars a week. i think i can get them to go as high as two.
i know you will.
...pardon?
what?
yo. charlie. gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. extra well done. hold the neurons.  patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  riddle me this, fred. what is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? your mind of course. and now mine pumps with the power of yours.  new from brain-bok. da pump. think faster. reason higher. out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. da pump. yeah.  ho! mark. i sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. the acrostic. the crypto-graphic. what doth this bode? answer me marcutio, you little runt.  fred, i must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. simply divine. but now i yearn for a meal of substance. the main course. a wide and varied palette. ah, to taste the mind of a hero. a nobleman. a poet.  a chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
yes, i come, i will do it.
will he live?
look, i'm sorry about everything.  i feel like an idiot.  you were right.  i did fuck you.  and then diego fucked me. cut me out, too.
listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  something's wrong.
what?
...our ass!
nah, nah, nah, nah.
what's wrong, brad?
wolfi!
took a pig-slicker to the heart.
shhh, shhh. you're not going to jail, frances. the judge has put you under my care. i'll see you get the rest you need.
but i have to, norman.
because that would mean they gave you mine.
well. there's the bible story. god took a rib from adam and made eve. maybe men chase women to get the rib back. when god took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
what about this beetle guy?
well, that's one way of putting it.
what about me?
i've been in here before.
it could be freezing, it could be raining.
uh.  what is it?
oh!  i thought maybe we could have a drink together?
left field somewhere.  well, bill, i want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
available cash is not an issue for us...
it killed him... you coulda just used draino. it's cheaper.

i'd like to go now, rand.  would you mind taking me home?
yes, i'll accept the charges.
i never saw anything like it. how did she pick him up so fast?
well, maybe you'll get lucky. someday.
how does it affect you?
my father didn't die in a fire?
nice first impression.  a nose bleed in front of your parents.
why not? sam, is she hiding here? are you two planning to go away with the money?
those flowers are too high. won't be able to see her.  get a smaller bowl, will you?
it's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
you heard about your father?
coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
not everyone here agrees with him. i mean, you know, about machines. there was even a big fight about it once.  do you like being a machine?
iraqis.
and how many people will be attending this birthday party?
well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
thanks. that's what i call it too.
you got it?  four year scholarship to a top college, plus medical school or law school or whatever joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
england went out with a stress fracture.  that puts you in charge, lieutenant.

i'm still on anti-biotics, i really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...gosh, i've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. never one like this. for one, i wasn't a mutant. secondly, i...what are you thinking?
you're gonna explain.
but with this place, i - - i wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  an aim devoid of  merit.
paxcow says daddy's going to do something really bad. he--
my violin is avenged!
if your friend is hot to trot...i know a couple of mama bears.  ...or is he married?
the point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. she got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and i think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
i'm not sure. i might have gotten some stories mixed up. did pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
they're getting bigger.
it hurts that you would say that to me.
ah-hah, i see. a cozy dinner. but aren't threesomes a little awkward? how does the phrase go--
bah, for that matter, algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
here. now leave me alone.
i told you.
shit!
maybe you do.  y'know i'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
what's going on?
yeah i know. you're smart judge. you ain't no bourgeois nigger like those paper panthers across the bay. i need every good man to help us with the security on betty shabazz, particularly soldiers. you do solid on that i might have something else for you, something real important.
i ought to call the police right now!
what are you missing?  riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. that shit is sadder than ethiopia.
beautiful specimen.
suffering. you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
who said there were four?
no. i ain't see anything like that.
what's your damage, heather? you ruined my...
oh. mary clarence, i'm so unworthy.  i want to take my final vows, i would do it tomorrow, but reverend mother won't let me!
hello, charles. has everyone checked in?
do what?
...fifty thousand dollars?
maybe.  i don't know.  i just know that when all this was happening, i felt, some part of me felt...alive.  like somebody needed me.  and the more i reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
your mother?
bye, birdie.  chip, honey... i know it's hard being a teenager but i understand... i'm your mother and i love you.
dad...
the whole summer, man.  party in tahoe.
why not, mrs. bundy?

there'll be another after me. and another after that. you'll find we're a resilient species.
rats! i've lost number three.
bela, i'm on your side.  c'mon, give me the gun...  if you give me the gun, i'll make you a drink.  what are you drinking?
i gotta be fucking crazy.
you've been to his quarters, haven't you?
i'm not sure.  as you know, the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
billy clanton, wes fuller, and billy claiborne.  now there's six of 'em.  this is like a bad dream.
bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  there is a provisory by- law in our charter.  per the discre- tion of the board, corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
can you imagine, if dickie did kill freddie, what must that be like? to wake up every morning, how can you? just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
we have some nice places around vancouver.
not a soul.
arlyn, just tell me, did jane have a dumper, one of her regular johns?
earth ii.
sorry, didn't mean to startle you. you didn't give me a chance to knock.
i love you don with all my heart.
and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, captain james tiberius kirk. i put it to you, captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
keith richards, dean martin...
i don't know if i want to.
don't toy with me, doctor.
what?
uh-oh.
i'm not allowed to drive those.
wait for gus to get here, sis.
it's okay...come on...
i’m having kind of a bad day.
it looks awful.
we took his system out.
all right, just a few questions.
when all this is over and we're not working for maxie, i'd love to run into you on the street.  why aren't you coming?
what the fuck is this?
that wasn't mrs. thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
hey, stop, stop. i'll do anything you want. it's okay. i can dig it. you can do anything you want to me.
i've met you before.
i don't want to listen to her sing -
why?
i didn't know what to think.  i can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  to know that he watched this... this atrocity.  but, i can't go to the police...
carousel.
we've got weather moving in from the west.
alice? the others show up?
dickson, i'd like to talk to you about the bank.
what happened to them?
beats fighting the flu, i'm here to tell you.
we have our own website now. we dedicated a whole page to you.
what kind?
yes - but you live here too - if it were your house?
want to give my flower a drink.
why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
jesus... fuck, that hurt.
oh.  well, where do we start?
you've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
isn't it about time you became something else?
should i have?
ain't sure, what's the story?
you heard mr. sandefur say before congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
is this the guy you saw them with?
no.
what do you say, jake?  should we trust her?  no?  i didn't think so.
that's brazil.
|      you turd! +      mangy scots git!
goebbels, yes, josef goebbels said, 'there's not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr. furtwängler has not intervened.' no, no one could have been less of a nazi than dr. furtwängler.
jesus.
well you must go. it is one of the most beautiful places on earth. of course, i'm rather partial.
how'd you know he died, he tell you?
you're not going out right away, are you?
i, i...i...
my king.
like this?
fine, thanks.
you're awake. good girl.
what does he say?
because you're coming home.
the ocean is uncrossable?
uh, mrs. swicker i got to meet some friends later, and i have to take a shower!
well, there's no way to determine that, sam.
is that the king of king you wish me to be?  or do you say this because of your son?
he wants us.
you know, i... don't know.
what do you do?
that's not your grandfather.
i can't tell you how happy we are that cecile is going to be attending oakwood with you this fall. you've always been an inspiration to beau and i on raising her. we just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
are you going public with this?
who's this?
all right? that's wonderful! it's the majestic -- 44th street.
we don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
do what, show you a good time?
terrific.  i'm doing vegetables next week.
if you let him testify then it would have all come out. west was supposed to take care of it out there, shut nunez up and then disappear. but it got messy and people got killed. so you called your old pal tom hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
i think-i think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
datura! miguel knew it! datura, he was shouting! datura metel!
uh...uh... mounties.  the mounties guard the border. uh... those mountie hats.
nobody! you are writing it for me! i gave you three pounds a month since.

everything.
what's happening to them?
you go to hell.
he is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
for six months.  i'm the day nurse...
i guess he misses a lot of dinners.
yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
frank mackey.  that's your son?
mr. duke tonight i'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide american casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
heather, why can't you just be a friend? why are you such a megabitch?
i'll need a last known address.
where is your wife?
take it easy, dude.
yes.  how do you know?
sex with simon?
it's not funny at all. one can't get intimate just off hand. i could go to england with you and everything like that -- supposing i met you next year and i said: 'how do you do, mr. preysing! and you said:  'that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester'.
i thought sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
would you like a drink?
i think this heat is making me crazy.  i was crazy to come back here, i'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and i'd sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute in this place.
space?
have you got a death-wish, ellen?
i'll take three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
uh-huh.  spent the last few days knocking on doors.  and you know what?  they're not.  i mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  and their pets are fine.  so i don't know -- i just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
look!
hello, mr. m.
jesus... they've probably got five bucks between them. turn around.
not very good!
and if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
it stings a little.
got all a's this year. teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
wanna play some tennis saturday?
what?  what kind of episode?
i am braver.
...okay, two...
look, co...
which is guy-speak for...
still clear. just a motorcycle.
i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox. i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. my wife is from boston. lillian ziegler?
you write gracefully.  calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
okay, sounds like you're all set. just clean the pipes and it's a go.
i don't mean to be inquisitive. but this <cmdf> -- for all i know it could stand for <consolidated mobilization of female delinquents>?
oh, george, george!
you know why i'm here.
that son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
so what's going on?
there's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what i mean?
i'm doing sixty years at otisville, no chance of parole.  even if they cut my sentence in half i'll be seventy-three years old.  that's some fucking deal.  i don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or jesus christ himself can get me out of here.  i have a really bad record, i'm not sure what's going to happen.
right, sure thing.  but what about, like, appliances?  like a little color portable?  boom box?
logan, do you see this ring?
please. that doesn't make you a nerd. everyone wore those shoes.
don't even start.
now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  come on, snap out of it. diz moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  to genteel crime, kid.
are you kidding, they love me.  i'm a star, lee.  a god to these people!
still after that first million before you're thirty.
romeo.
then what are you afraid of?
my name is jennifer hillman.  i'm an archaeologist.  i read in the paper about the murder yesterday and i thought i should come talk to you.
yes, gentlemen. saturday after next, i lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the tv down?
i won't thank you! i'll never thank you!
what's she doing here?
so... they're on some cycle. the murders... gregory... then 28 days later... carlton.
i did this already.
i'm glad you're around to say it.
mr. chance, i'm very pleased to meet you.
did she hurt herself?
i thought it was tremendous.
i need to leave you now.
can i interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
you don't know me from a hole in the wall.
but how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  you also state that bright eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
let me come get him.
aren't these lovebirds?
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud
i'm josephine.  sax.
so how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of batman?
joey?
okay, okay. you win.
chance to get even?
he's ninety. he's practically dead already. how come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>i</u> stay here?
the first guys to the car when jack and i got there were bruening and carlisle.
i -- i don't understand...
bastard, sneak, quitter.
what the child?
-- who can say. he's off his onion, y'know, he's old school sicilian, this is how they hate.
i don't want to talk about this here.
no! okay! okay!
in his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  covered with blood.
minneapolis... good.
what guy
evening. welcome to phoenix.
i thought it was interesting --
even in berlin.
god. i can't believe it.
you mean did i write it before my parents died?
congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. i guessed you weren't a stickler for tradition, doctor.
now that's sharp. that is sharp. chain give you any trouble?
i have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. we want to be safe.
barton, i'm afraid it's not a good time-
no, i just know jack's lying about what happened. he just seemed -- i know that kid, what he's like inside. he's a lot like i was at his age.
hi, grierson, forgive the war paint.  going on to my regiment/s reunion after.
who the fuck knows? musta slipped or something. i just heard the gun go off.
ask a question, you get an answer!..
that cuthbert.  what a piece of work. someone's dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit.
what happened?
what did he say?
i think they'd understand.
i could hang myself.
come on.  beats study hall, doesn't it?
go and look for a note.
take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
i got it done.
parker.
he say anythin'... the kid... ?
give me some credit. i got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. this is never going to stop if we -
are you supposed to take that many?
set up the camera boys! get a shot of me comin' ashore!
what's that supposed to be, psychology?
i lost six pounds...
who?
think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
come up and see me... now.
rose, are you all right? are you sick or something?
i don't care about the money.  i just want the show to deliver.
right.  why not?
ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
tell me about yourself.
we'd only just met.
big league pitchers don't use these.
newt.  look at me...newt.  i won't leave you.  i promise.
ok, i will... later.
they're all gone--or dead.
now if i got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
you certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  you've killed an icon, for god's sake.
you're getting old, gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of edinburgh --
tommy reina. good pal. better partner.
it was fine.
hey, where did you come from?
you told it to me.
when we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
i'm clean.
extraordinary!
glaucoma?
where -- where do we go now?
it still doesn't matter if i kiss you?
just as you say, hoffy. but wouldn't it be smarter if i went out and kept schulz tied up?
hi.  did you call --
s.r. hadden...  you compromised our security codes.
you're conceited--
how much time?
you lose this?
wire it to the western union in oklahoma city,
yes.
hey peter, lemme ask you a question.  an old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on christmas eve...
what's up with this shit.
no. it's the junk. i like to look at junk.
information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  that's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, i get hired not to work.  nice girl you were with last night. known her long?
hello, young fellow.
you heard him.  i'm a star!
fuck, yes.  hell, i'm already in jail.  i got no reason to lie to you.  i ain't no nigger.
i'll think about it.
it's such an honour for us to have you here, herr mozart. and for gertrude.
about a dog.
uh, yoo-hoo.  excuse me!  sorry to interrupt, but i got some big news.
what about me?
oh, please, nick.
i'm serious, wade.  this case is important to me.
they don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something i'm not even going to ask about--
petty good.
small, blond, good-looking. she was with him when we met. she had a funny english accent.
how do you know that?
early night for you, isn't it?
sanchez...?
it looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
oh sure.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
tell me you didn't start up on that flight 180 shit again.  did you?
i was wondering...  do you have dinner plans?
what did he give you?
why didn't you turn on the light?
you don't have that one, do you?
just a little. i've had a tough day.
who's side are you on?
oh, well, i can't . . .
what about you?
ouch. come on, don't bust my chops. i know it's corny, but i do love it.
...and who was benjamin franklin again?
ain't worth thinking about.
i put in for a replacement for you but no one...
hypotheticals --
my equations are not parlor-tricks!
you don't have any money put away, do you?
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west. how was he supposed to say no to that?
and keep only forty-percent?  no thanks.
moreover... 
do you love drew?
standing by, captain kirk.
what about the rest of the inspection, admiral?
no thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  if you try that at msu this saturday, i'm pretending i don't know you.
well, i could say the same about you.
hey, what are you doing? why are you wearing a suit again?
have you seen this? 
there is no smoking in this building, ms. tramell.
-- but the dogs treed him between huxley and kafka.
for your breath.  you could use it. squirt some in your mouth.
you've <u>never</u> been in venice?
i dream of death mostly.
he's passionate.
you remember lindsay don't you?
a ticket home,
thought that door was open last night...
you sure?
your grandmother?
well i guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard per-gola. you can stand up in it. well, some people could stand up in it. six foot clearance at the ridge. you might just could.
well he's not exactly a friend.
you don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
why didn't you tell me?
martin, this is jay.  the intakes are clogged with dust.  we overheated and burned out a whole cell.
where are you going?
i'm sorry if i've ruined your day, mr. reynard. but my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
where am i?
what's her name?
yeah, well i guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
heard you done the roof yourself.
hello.
that was very good.
what can i do for you, lad?
i'll take it out of their skulls.
seventy-two clients.  one stayed.  jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
cool.
good morning, mr. brandon.
is eric in school?
what is this? what's going on, who is that?
i'm not here to fight.
okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  you come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. you go to tobacco... tobacco is a sales culture. market and sell enormous volume. go to a lot of golf tournaments. the hell with everything else.  what are you doing? why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
but how can you be sure?
is that what i just said?
where's martini and scanlon?
you are from the hollow?
alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
mr. abraham...
you didn't have to kill sophie.
you mean, he might be hiding there?
i forgot your name.
i'm really sad it's closing. now what am i gonna do on tuesday nights?
tell her to get the kids and leave town.
mary clarence!
pretty low all around.
i thought he was lying.
my dear princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  i suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
what's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
yeah. oh, god bless!
um --
and who, rose, may i ask, is that?
we'd appreciate it if the maharajah would let us stay tonight. we'll be on out way in the morning.
it's a start.
yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  don't give me that crap. just put on the taps.  now.
i want to have a look around before i take you.
do you have everything you need from command?
her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and i'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
or you could try lying down.
i'd like to offer my congratulations. that was a beautiful gesture of howard's.
i didn't mess things up because i was scared.  i slept with ray because i was sick of you.  and i needed something to snap me out of it.
no,  i am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter rearranger, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
drive by patrol.
let's string him up by his pull- string!
no!
he's cute...and he's got a crush on you...  but...
why didn't someone tell me!
go away. who are you --?
no.  you just described every great success story.  alright, it's alright.
just of getting hurt. they can't touch me inside.
got that.
maybe i'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  or maybe i’ll snap its ugly head off.
poor missy. god, i was sorry to hear. i remember when she was no older'n ellen there, walking down to the store with her raggedy anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. i don't know why god takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
morelli -  you knew julia.  was she gypping wynant?
hello, herman, it was a happy landing, i see.
yes?
norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
i - uh --
i'm in a rooming house with mr. green.
tuesday. are you okay?
oh, lady. if you're in your right mind, i pray you go insane.
don't be a baby. you're tougher than that.
have a good trip.
send the fleet to the far side of endor. there it will stay until called for.
nobody related to mcculloch can be nice.
i just think you're wrong, is all.
what's the matter?
i'll take your luggage back, baas.
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction.
you look bushed. what time did you get to bed?
can we expect the same kid of panic here as in russia?
you alright?  y'okay?
yeah, but it was shot.
when?
how did you know that?
but you won't. you're a good man detective. we think alike. i know you need my help. and i know you know i need your help.
whose justice? yours or god's?  when will you stop?
everyone has to practice.
hold that thought.
so now you're -- ?
double down.

i've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, cathy -- even i would never have believed it is of you.
no.  keep getting an answer- ing machine.
just, just take it easy, walter.
what is it about my writing that's so rotten?
mr. saavik, all stop.
hello.
it's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. if i had the strength i'd knock down these damn walls -- if i could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
yes?
we could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
and there was a third man there. i suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
we didn't do so bad after all.
not this twig, friend.  i got plans.
mrs. peel -- ?
sorry about what happened at the dresden. i had no idea...
i always suspected the effects might come back. that's why i had to follow you. i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
slider -- they let you into top gun? if you're among the best in the navy, i tremble for the security of this country.
of course.  i shouldn't be over here at this hour.
well, i'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. let me borrow her dossier for a while.
hey, what are you doing here?
my father, he was -- he was real close to evil. people didn't know. still don't. from the time i was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. i don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. and when i turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. starla looks at bill, who seems struck.
would you like to see that?
why?
what <u>about</u> a crowbar?
shelly...!
a shooting war!
really?
god, she's beautiful.
and i know too many people.  obviously, we're both lonely.  would you like to know where i was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my sunday clothes?
i actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
yes.
and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale. we'll have a lot of laughs. when i send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
claudia dear, come closer.  this is max fabian. he is a producer. go do yourself some good.
ah, ha! hold the phone! no forwarding address, huh?  in the shock of this brilliant move, i forgot something.
you can help us.
i understand that you have political ambitions.  unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
i wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
then help me to understand.  i want to understand.
he wants to pull that tube out. it's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
sire, you know how bad i am at this sort of game.
welcome home.
but, hey, some good news.  this last one put me way ahead of schedule. we've actually got some time to kill.  jazz?  you like jazz?
well...that's it.  we're not getting off this rock...
hey.  way to gut it out.
no, they broke up again. bailey won't stop drinking and sarah can't take it anymore.
roger de bris.  roger de bris.  oh yes, the director.  is he good... i mean bad?
more wine, sister?  surely you can drink more than that.
well, think it then, because it's true! we'll crucify that mob. we're going to keep williams under cover till morning so the post can break the story exclusive. then we'll let the governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
and maybe we could get mr. warner and mr. goldwyn and mr. cohn and mr. selznick to play as well.
yes, sir, of course, sir, i was merely speaking hypothetically.  if this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  but of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
you're acting like a crazy person.
mac, that was wonderful. i haven't been to a concert since...
hey, kid, that's okay. i don't wanna see kiss that ba...
i guess you saw the show...?
shit, bob. what the fuck did you do that for?
because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and i just hate her she's such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think that now. why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? i mean, it's okay and everything, but i don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
he asked me to marry him.
they wouldn't deal with a guy like jack. who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead?
such as?
i would expect he does.
it'd never get through. all packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. you didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
she stole some money.
don't i find what?
lila, it's rosie.
reed, i'm not talking about debbie.
403 41st street, kids: home.
to the diggings i worked at a year ago. it's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
'really a lot appreciate it...'
i don't know, i haven't read much. i don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
yes, that is what i was thinking.
well, a gal a day is enough for me. i couldn't handle any more.
let's take it down a notch.
god, vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
sure... sure, it's his house.
ray, you protected ty and larry up in casitas, didn't you?
tucker, you know where the money is-- i want it.
it's iggy pop.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
i need it now i need some
hmm. go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
see what??
you're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? how'd you ever get so mean, auggie?
suppose i'm not exciting enough for you.
i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
still afraid somebody may see us together?
that's me, clifford.
who is it raped you?
what the hell does gordy have to do with it?
what did you think you were doing in his tent?
he killed three men in a motel in del rio yesterday. and two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
just listen to this—  adorable babykins— does her miss her baby? him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. bobo is so lonely—!
come on, john. what happened?
take the western passage.
she's mad.
what?
just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
shit! this is too much!  chief, i tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to canada before they know what bit 'em.
father, i--
such as?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
no-no-no...
well... that's my business, madame.
you know, eat healthier.
i didn't know that you spoke french.
it wasn't much of a lie.
you didn't become crazy.
oh yes! it was wonderful!
i was!
i love your sexy talk. it's so... kindergarten: poo-poo; wee-wee.
i'm taking you back. you can still live.
this thing means that much to y...
is that it ?
well, i do commercials, sort of...
and, why is that?
when you're here, in the city, where do you live?
right.  but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed... but not big billy.  he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  it came to the end of the game.  it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  i decide when i'm done with your boyfriend.  not him, and certainly not you.  unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
by 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  more, with this wind.
nothing.  not a trace.
well, destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, i dare to coin.
only one way you can help me. you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
all right. when <u>is</u> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
j39 z186...?
jack...
how was it...?
but you were pulling your hips last night.
let's look at the fucking thing.
how did she hide it during the day?
...no treasure... i had two weeks left on my sentence...
when you do...
whatchu doing here?
... eve - this has been an exhausting day for ben...
specifically, humpback whales.
is white meat all right for you, mr. shea?
i gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
well, you got me here so do your worst but i'll take one of you with me.  oh, i know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but i'll defy you still.
merlin, tell me. now that guenevere is returned to me...
kamal is not here.  we are very defused.
oh, an tv a minute and already an attitude.
mr brown is unable to attend today.
yeah, bazza, what?
having a problem with your eye there?
this could be worse than the old series.
the nite owl.  anything bothering you about the case?
oh, so loosely.
john, get out of the way!!
he flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
i'm sorry, man.
hold on -- nobody interviews maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
what about... now?
you want me to move?
but yourself?  what about john brown?
mary.
it's too bad about what happened on the road.
and who is defending paris?
you were up late last night, too, rose.
you could say that.
this is the place. they'll never fuck with us here.
you?  you think you're the only one?  i've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
how could you?  i'm a woman...
i'm sure.  and kate, thank you for coming.  thank you for being such a good friend.
who needs vermouth?
there.  all done.  lift me down.
you're all right, argyle.
you know i trust you, claude.
you don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! did you see his *face*--?
you're out looking here?
i'm really sorry that i hurt you, brian.
you evil this morning.
but...
well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. there's brian and marty. peter breck's already been cast as brian. and you're reading for the part of marty. now in this scene you're both in a car and bill shatner's hanging on the hood.  and what you're trying to do is get him off.  whenever you're ready.
if it can produce a miss sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
what do these ingredients mean?
oh fuck, norman!
alvy, you were... alvy, you were just great, i'm not kidding. it was- you were so neat.
look at it this way. he might achieve everything your son never did.
you shouldn't have had any doubts.
are you a bad boy?
i'm the only one who can cut him down.
lieutenant?
what?
you don't.
well, i'll tell you.  i was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did i see but this fucking guy.  i didn't know you guys were living in california.
the... bullets?
why would he pick this one?
i just thought it might --
but you didn't.
never mind that shit.  just point.
who would do that?
when you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
from the cook, sir they saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
standing guard over the old castle, are you?
i'm serious, frances. this is important.
mr. gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
ssshh! what was that?
i'm fine. i've just never had someone my age die before. it's so weird.
yes, your eminence.  the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
well, sir, i'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr. thompson?
you know, you're pushy, fella...
i shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
that would be totally out of character. helping people is against my principles.  see, he definitely doesn't know me.  now, i'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science while you torture this intruder to death.
yes.
i think that you might go and have a look yourself.
what's this? december 8th, 1958?
i can't get hold of him. he's in europe.
have you no feelings, woman?
let's walk.
you can do whatever you want with your own life. we're thinking of the baby, that's all. we want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. before it's too late.
she wasn't your type anyway.
where were you?  on a... uh,					* mission?
courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
what kind of an act is this?
you set this all up, didn't you?  one of your sick jokes?
really, what's that?
lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. they do move in herds!
you have very nice ceilings.
it's better you don't know.
then, what do you suggest, don sanchez?
oh, what bullshit? what, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
it's got nothin' to do with you, wyatt.  it's-
that's what we're here to find out.
you sound so sure.
right.  yes.  of course.
no.
are you...okay?
why? jesus! why me? why can't i wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? and why am i still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? worst of all, why can't i feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? why do i have to know, over and over, that it was you. you who died; died for my sins! and that i will die for nothing. why?
just tell me that evan doesn't have jason's illness...
forward motion, captain...!
joan of arc! what's it to you?
they're weird names.
i agree with mr. rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but i don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  dr. arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
which guy in toledo are you talking about?
somebody say somethin'?
i figure we'll get along just fine.
makes sense - he's a spokesman.
she'll forget about us eventually.
i didn't want to marry anybody else in town. i want my baby to look like you.
grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
oh burke! poor burke!
did you see that? it's remarkable!
i'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
c'mon, pal.
forget it.
you charge by the hour?
yes. the vampire apocalypse. it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst.
to buy lingerie.
you got a point there.
then don't come any closer.
station wagon?
supper for two.
mr. marschal gets real lonely.
i told 'em i'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
i saved you.
then what?
they lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  but there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
what kind of deal you looking to?
i'm all excited --
the porter is going to talk to us tonight.
where are we going?  you know i hate surprises.
the young girl is slashed again.
they're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
let's have your name and address. the government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
why can't i let go of this woman?
you could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
this your stuff?
yeah. she seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why i said yes to this move. but, whenever it's just the two of us, i don't know... anyway... what's happening with the delco lawsuit?
i know.  it's an awful lot.
yes.
huh?  grimsurd looks at his thumb.
okay. "dance music for old people?"
by the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
yeah only i wish they had the sister on more.
like what?  i got a little power, sure. a touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  but no more than you do.  we're not witches.  i can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. besides, maybe they deserve it.  maybe we all do.
perhaps the "jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  absolutely no practice necessary.  you shread like a giant. just press a button.
just coffee.
what?
yeah.
you can't treat me like this.  i'm not a child!
"no" you're not sure or "no" i'm not fat?
this has nothing to do with him.
what?
no, but... why didn't he stop it? or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
hit me in the chest with this...
seems i am.
that's why the people trust you george.  without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. will you do it?
if i'm closing out this account. if he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
why did you take the back roads here?  they're not safe.  you'd know that if you'd planned.
well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. if i were to take my men away, mickey knox would snap your neck like a twig.
no. kisses to you.
no juliet?!
they want to replace me! the board of trustees wants to *replace* me!
whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
have you gotten us a room yet?
i know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  if you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  i say fall head over heels.  find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  and how do you find him?  forget your head and listen to your heart.  i'm not hearing any heart.  run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  to make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. you have to try.  because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
they feel you've been sort of left out of things, terry. they think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
you're out of your minds, you know that? both of you.  you don't even know if there's anything out there.  what the hell are you thinking?
come again?
go on, hit me.
they need to run first and second?
that is repugnant. you have the habits of a goat.
you're not sure?
i could, but it's confidential.  look, the point is, we didn't talk.  i told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
all europe shall hear of this!
if i die, then they'll be free. it's getting late, isn't it? i can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. it's warm then it gets cold. jeffrey. i feel it getting cold.
it doesn't look like that.
we're not actually talking about it.
if you're taking people, take me. but my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
drunks.  crawfished a bet, called him a liar.  i saw the whole thing.
i know what you did.
carlo!
zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. karen sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. evans was buried. when we get zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
his name was arturo marquez. a petty smuggler out of argentina. he was arrested in new york last year for trafficking. he escaped to california and got picked up in long beach. they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. get this - edie finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
ed concannon.
anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
you lump them all together -- anglo workers and anglo bosses.
well why don't you look her up?
mary rooney. she won't talk to me. i tried her at the hospital. i'm going to try her back at home. read this.
you make me feel...
places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. but you don't have to understand. i do. so no talking.
sooner or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  you always do.
please!
we'll never know for sure.
sure.
we'll be going to warp speed --
then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
accident.
it wouldn't bother you if buzz was in danger, would it?
continued
i'm not very good at this, mitch.
jad.  how come you're not out there with father witwer?
was she one of your teachers?
you want us to give you cash right now?
and she saw you?
how can i help you, mr. wayne?
you have the right to speak to an att --
i'm hungry.
the cash man!
oh god, i'm scared.
what happened to your neck?
the only honest thing to do is call it off. let her look for somebody else.
nothing.  there's no safe under here.
your mom take anything before this happened?
i must receive proof more conclusive than mr. poe's opinion before i weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
the what?
would that be a problem?
honestly, merk. it's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
ugh!!  why do they have to do that?
i need to see you.
what did he sound like on the phone?
thank you, sir.
yes.
if we squeeze him through, i'm going to get him into androscoggin college.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
that bad?
rick...?
he escaped...
that's like your car, beverly,
is that the money?
i'm sorry, i'm late.
just one kiss. for old times' sake.
or we'll go somewhere.  if you have the time.
i hope those rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
i don't know how.
look, i'm genuinely sorry...
you told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
get outta here!
i don't think your friend likes me.
do you feel comforted?
it's the only way you're gonna get ganz.
same one you were reading the other night?
hi.
jackie didn't trust melanie. she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. what she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
you gotta believe me –
how's that?
what if one hasn't a soul any more? what of that?
chambers - reilly. time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
damn!  val, we can't get them.  never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  best goddamn bullet stop there is.  come back.
i can't hold the weight of both of you!
more romances for john?
he hates me.
where?
wait a second. did you say "patricide?"
what is the chief part?
i'm a doctor.
why have we stopped?
dr. crowe?
she hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! so when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - i won't have it! eve harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! and to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
come on in!
bye-bye, boys.
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
are you trying to tell me that the houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure mrs. holland?
alright... take it down.
nothing for me. i'm leavin'.
i get all your cds.
no.
hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
thanks, uh, lilly.
no. i will not betray my friends.
nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
her father didn't leave her squat.  the kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and sandra seems to have the idea that kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
yeah.
denmark makes great nautilus equipment.
they're outside the beaming shield. mr. scott, start your engines.
no, thank god... just missed him.
case... yeah, miami joeboy, quick study. how you doing, kid?
<i>                      i've got something, listen now, this one is real good, you'll see. we'll send a present to his door upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
what's this supposed to mean?
why don't you say hello?
my blood will soon reverse its flow. it's the same poison she used to kill my master.  there is no antidote.
grass never did that to me.
well, ask her!
all right. i've done it. now, are you satisfied?
it happened after i talked to you. i do not like coincidences!
salem, massachusetts?  where all the witches were?
what was it?
from before the beginning, young fellow. and now it's after the end.  anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
now i’m worried...just say it.  whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
mikey williams?
where will you keep them?
and you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
excellent!
hey!  what're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
why not?
we've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  while the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about truman himself.  no scripts, no cue cards.  it's not always shakespeare but it's genuine.  that's how he can support an entire channel.
what do you think?
what did he say?
i want'to talk to her.
get the next plane.
my condolences.
honey, you know what i've been like lately... i've been a total zombie.  i have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
oh, you-you have that one?
what so you can just exploit her again with another book? sid doesn't need you gale.
[so am i, sister.]
i know!
what ? are you my mother ?
what is it? has he found him?
most important...i want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
no it's fine, really, uh--
i'd rather sing than do anything!
how's the trailer?
this is very good for us.
why are you here. whatiya want?
yessir.
oh, well, we'll just have to try again. sound like a plan?

yes, sir, i am.
i know your height, your weight and your social security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
wait!  wait!  let me ask you something.  if you like shot superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
so you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
no.  no.  i am sorry.  forget everything i say.  here.  i will take the tray.
they'll be back in a week.
thank you.  "now hear this: drop dead."
moss.
like everybody else--except us. always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. your parents ... ?
yeah, i guess. maybe not. you don't think a psychiatrist-?
explain to me again why we didn't do this in des moines in an air conditioned office?
listen, viktor... i want to talk to you now, not as elaine, studio head, but elaine, ex-wife.  second ex-wife.  you got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  we both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced simone to be in it.
i suppose it's... i mean define your terms.
what's the charge?
no, i'm not saying her. i'm just saying, i don't know.
will he yield for a question?
i kind of asked him to. we were, you know... he got a little carried away...
because if you do, i'll kill you!
well, then, what i am i doing here?  i assume i'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
i told you to stay away from tramell.
for the first time in my life, i wish this car wasn't green.
what?  but you been working so hard --
he still gets air sick, huh? in all of this i didn't get the chance to thank you two.
i screwed up the divorce. i agreed with everything she said. i wanted her to like me. i just want to be a good father.
tell him not to waste time calling. to get over here soon as he can. i think thorwald's pulling out tonight.
i'm just offering a place to stay.
i think treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
it isn't that she hasn't got any sense, doll. her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
--how old?
he had you down as a big-timer. what happened?
we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships. but it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
i mean it.  it's no good to me anyway.  help yourself.
you know, i never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, teresa's arm went completely dead.
those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  he <u>kills</u> people!
only god knows the answer to that.
she'll need both of us.
the cops?  the cops read my column to know who to bust.  we're the only watchdog the public has.  none of this is going away.  we'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  until you slip up.  and you will.  you are looking at your shadow.  because all these elaborate precautions with simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
this is bad, joe. the prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. they'll argue exactly the opposite. they'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
it's no trouble. i'd like to ask you some more questions.
you told me you'd break up that romance - when?
come in.
hey gus--did you see the story idea i left on your desk?
okay.  'b-y-e!
will ya look at her!
this one guy on death row, who i'll call henry, told me about his last victim. henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named adele. her mother's in the living room watching tv. she's got the volume on so damn high he can hear david letterman's jokes. henry puts his hand over adele's mouth and says, "if you scream, little girl, i'll kill your mother." and of course little adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  ten days later they find adele's body. or what's left of it.  you believe in fairy tales?
what'd it say?
that's right, now if you could...
didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
what, vincent?  this is me, doll.  i know you.  what did you think you were doing?  running to the cops.  hiding out. no, no.  you're sorry now, aren't you?
who's nobody?
you, uh, you ever been to louisville during derby week, miss, ah, packard?
"up to you, jeffrey. that's the power you have, jeffrey. vital insider information the american public need to know." lowell bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
i never met him.  i knew him only from his writings.
don't talk like that!
yes.
what do you know about spirits? you ain't no in'dn.
i think it has something to do with your birthday. you were rambling. i didn't understand the rest.
reba...
how old?
gotta keep track of the competition.
you're a very nice guy, and i don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
you know, my name's not spooky. it's, it's rachel.
how do you know?
you can believe this, miguel. i'll kill you if you shoot. we must wait. i'll....i'll do it....i'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
that means it was a success.  i woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  here, take this.
no. and yet she does where the ink has run with tears. was she weeping when she gave you this?
ready for what?  sight-seeing?
this one's interesting.  berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  three hundred eyewitnesses.
i'll be careful.  i'll see y'later.
how have you survived so long?
how can you be out here?
the sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
it's like the stone age.  the room time forgot.  what about a phone?
look at that place. it's creepy.
thank you.
you know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
well. i got an audition tomorrow.
bill...this is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. but i think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
please.. you shouldn't laugh --
of course!  d.t.v.'s most popular hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, cosmo and nation mckinley. neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my french. i recommend you send brad to them for treatment!
you understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
if you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
you think skipper and alice do it?
charles, my time is too valuable for me -
it has your ring.
the ancient greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring vrykolaka --
so, you didn't mention my name? you haven't talked to anybody about me?
would it have helped if i'd knocked him down?
yes --?
they stole our land--
this is such a mess.  i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now i'm landed in it all over again.  for god's sake, i've got a boyfriend.
go!  hey!  go! caravaggio is in terror.
yeah.  could be.  go say hello, romeo. looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
yeah --
i only get one today? gee, how exciting.
you really think i'm attractive?
was the stone very smooth?  it was probably brought here from a sacred river.
i know...i know. you did the right thing.
well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
security consultant.
we have work. it pays a lot. unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
we should have driven.
i left it at work.
ev-i-dence.
open the door, will you?
i am michael simonovitch iranoff.
gun shot.
speak.
how do you remember how to talk?
anything. strong.
well, i don't.
anything.
yeah, i know all that.
she said something about that, mrs. reed — but she didn't tell me it was the farren house. i'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
of course i have.
how are you feeling today?
'i like him'?  diane, i'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
no, i don't.
damn you, long!  my people are out there! your people are out there!
what did he do this time?
could it be the crew? if they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
randall.
i heard that one myself, bob. hell, i even thought i was dead til i found out it was just i was in nebraska.  who's your friend?
don't be frightened.  do you think i'd make my sister a widow?  do you think i'd make your children fatherless?  after all, i'm godfather to your son.  no, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  i'm putting you on a plane to vegas--and i want you to stay there.  i'll send connie an allowance, that's all. but don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  who approached you, tattaglia or barzini?
what is it about?
what do you mean, 'how did he look'?
what do you mean gone?
i'm not finished. i'll only be in port one week a month and when i'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who i am. like i told you on the phone, you i'd be better off in that state school back in virginia.
how?
well.
do you know who mr. marsh was with?
well, then i guess this is our first date... or our last. until now, i wasn't sure it was either.
uh-huh...
i am.
i said get out!
i'm helping him bring his money into america. he loves the idea. you just missed him.
ah, go on, you swine.
that's the key to the city of pasadena, which mr. lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
but you know he did it.
let's go sit by the piano.
i haven't talked to anyone about paris. i haven't said a word.
i'm assuming you read my deposition.
this wouldn't happen if he was with you. i mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. i totaled three cars in fives years.
no, i just heard the commotion, and when i got there i guess it was gone.
help you? you've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  you're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
look, it's a longshot...
relax, that's my ma's code for, "bring home milk and a carton-a luckys."
no.  what am i to do?
yeah. eight, it says here.
what guy?
tell me.  has black peter already crossed off a few bad children?
what your husband was mixed up in.
tell what you see. write it well, sir, and make sure you get it right
i'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
we can get a job with another band. a male band.
i think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
adam, your bozman building is a beauty.
look at him take it!
tell what?
shit! nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. so you won't eat pussy? motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
where do you kill them...
it was not. the barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
so what's the problem?
well, ain't that the truth...
you get rid of her.
i'm not waiting...so give me the gun and keep the ring.
what's happened?
mirrors, then. it's done with mirrors.
what did you say your name was, sweetheart?
i can't help you if you don't help yourself.  it's really up to you. brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
as soon as we've taken over the world i'm gonna change my name to sir mordant.  or how about major mordant?!
yeah, well, it's a theory. here's your novril.  how does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
you fool -- look around you! this planet is destroying itself!
they're talking to themselves.
could we hear to the moon?
it's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
offer me your confession. i can offer you god's forgiveness.
i'm not mad at you.

was he with a girl?
they also tried using viral r.n.a. as the bonding element.
he'll tell me when he gets home.
i was nervous -
i do, beautiful horses. thank you, holiness.
and then what?
you've absolutely no idea where david might be?
okay. here it is.  ever want to be someone else? now you can. no kidding. only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. visit j.m. inc., mertin-flemmer building. etc., etc.
alright, it's done.
every time i kiss you now i'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
yes -- ?
no.
and she's turned you into a servant.
she seems pleasant enough.
you new?
no one's dying on my watch, smith! what about the reserve tanks?
do you really think i'm mad?
you ok, bob?
if he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
i want to know!
we've have to stop!
anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
so, what, why can't you do that here? what's wrong with here? why is somewhere else better?
how is it a woman like you never married? and don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
how about tomorrow?
it goes on and on.
what? really?
soran?
i mean if you didn't know who i was.
champagne?
i've never been here before. i wonder whom you're thinking of. oh, i know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. today... now this might shock you... i went up to a taxi and said "eight rue du bois"... and here i am.
-- it's just him? --
enjoy.
remember the alamo?
after six.
sure you don't want any salad?
you don't move, you understand?!  you don't move!
i can't imagine you crying.
you know what i want, miz lampert...
when does the bus leave?
do something!
with a little jazz.
i can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
i need more pressure in the shark tank.
gordon what i want--and i never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. i want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. it's gonna make us a fortune!
moi?
how about ding dong?
only yes and no...  you're a bit.
all right.
pretty good--thirty <u>miles</u> an hour--
are you threatening me?
do we need a plane?  how does this work? when do i see you?
pops!
jack, must you go?
a cold drink.
masseria's scared. he might make our deal.
these things get around, father. two warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. how about putting me in for this new treatment, father?
the ink on your divorce isn't dry. your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, michael francis... was in some trouble with the reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
wendy?
much.
how should i know? "solving a problem," i guess. or needing to control everything. i don't know.  i've gotta get in there.
it is  jon.  twenty-four years ago.  before he turned into dr. manhattan.
what?
what?
how'd you find me?
she went back to south africa.
what???
you're not joking.
max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
maybe i should drive this time.
done much shooting with that rifle yet?
if i had to guess by your eyes, i'd say you were fifty.
what the hell happened?
this has nothing to do with me--  but always remember, purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... then-- back of the collar--<u>here</u>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
don't be defensive.  i'm just surprised to see you.
just think about it.  that's all i ask.
my dear niece -- i must ask you not to interfere.  war is not a woman's problem.
what's that fucker ever done for us?
pay the rent.  let the tailor wait.
john gammell?
he's comin' over.
listen carefully, i wrote the amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, i want you to lose it for me, now. tonight.
james leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
i guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
she called me.
what about it?
i've been thinking about it for a long time.
thanks, but no thanks.
i saw her come in five minutes. ago.
...oswald?
that was billy ansel on the phone. he wants to come over to talk to us.
i've just had hilda hulme on the phone.
--no--
oooh! here! here!
you're making me very angry.
oh, no, ray. not tonight. spanky's not happy with you.
yeah.  you don't wanna know the details.
and that's what concerns me. elizabeth, we will be landing in port royal soon, and beginning our new lives. wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
the kids are in here!
no. i don't sprechen sie deutsch.
maybe she didn't come here.
i would have tried not to.  but yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, i would have.
well, i do remember why i started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in new york with cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
what alibi?
i just feel as though i'm being made ready for the executioner.
i don't know what you mean, miss ilsa.
you know, i believe she's actually jealous.
are you supposed to be in iowa?
you can fix old cars. mr. washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
a <u>hot</u> cartoon.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. they've got all the l.a. phone books, plus medical directories...  we're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? i'm making this my personal mission.
mr. kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus.
the commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
there you are dead wrong.
bats aren't rodents, dr. meridian.
paleo-dna?  from what source?  where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
i don't get the humor of that remark.
why are the police taking this all so seriously?
huh huh huh. settle down beavis.
can we talk later? will you be at the party?
y-yes, sir.
what's this tiger shit?
he's got a gun, sir.
how much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
i got whiskey here.
don't confuse what we do with who we are.
we're here.
i don't want to die without any scars.  how much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  come on... you're the only person i've ever asked.
aaah, what's the use?
i empathize with your plight, fletch. however, you threw her out.
i dunno what i'd do with your help. i've gotta take her out of there ..
get your clothes on, lady --
there's a spider in the bathroom.
his movie nut mind has snapped, sid. he's gone psycho.
you are ready, then?
man that's a trippy name, kinda like the warhol mayhem series...
terrible thing. so will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
no, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! and i guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
dat's yo uncle ben.  that reminds me, i've seen a lot of troubles lately.
it's an "unsolved." they spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - you might wanna check it with taylor, he worked the case.
well, may we have a look around?
that's possible. sir august was convinced he'd met me before. but i'd never met him. another odd thing. when it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
forgive me father, for i have sinned. it has been two days since my last confession. father, my sin is a terrible sin. a sin of omission. there was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin i think was graver stil.
what time did you say they would be there?
the most important one. can you help me find him?
have you ever heard of the calan?
now, dave old buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  what do you think of this husband of yours?  on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer.  but unfortunately, in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself -
indeed i did. up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
you don't think either one of us could ever change?
what do you want? an apology?
let's not jump to conclusions.  this egg could belong to any number of reptiles, dr. frock.
"yet."
shhh... don't talk.
you tell me.  i remember a lot of things. i remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the devil's chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and france.
it's worse than war. it's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
i remember when the echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
this is one-way street.  you go down the block to the middle.
same old stuff.  how's the pharmacy?
yes.
mel's doing some business with me. it's nice to do favors for people you do business with. he was in a hurry. no big deal.
now your signature.  not "dickie". your signature.
well... maybe...
shit, rose! what's there to decide? there's only four of us.
you told me this was how it happened.
i wanted to apologize.
oh. well, thanks for the drink.
an ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  i'll tell you what happened to my arm.  i'll tell you what happened.  twelve years ago, god looked down on me and said, "cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. first of all, i'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then i'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then i'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. but you, cyrus, i'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. and just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, i'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. if i wanted to, i could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but i'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. every time you look at your hook, i want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. let that be a lesson to you, cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
why didn't we get that?
today, i'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  you think you're better than that?  fine.  show me.  show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. a lot better.  but first, jack, you gotta earn it.
when?
it's a ninety-one!  it's an 'a'!
how is that wally doing?
it appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the x-rays...
one of edinburgh's finest schools.
and it's hungry.  it's been two days since it's eaten.  there are five hundred people arriving right now. the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  all those people in one enclosed space...
shut up. i'm all right.
you passed spanish because you gave professor montoya a hand-job after the final.
what are you doing here?  is anything wrong?
austin, what's your point?
you know, i've thought about that, actually.
it's not even a proper novel! it's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. the characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
what for?
she's an alcoholic, for christ's sake.
i didn't mean to...
sure.  and the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  nearly snapped me in half.
no, sir.
then i'd say you're a lucky fellow.
now how's your memory doin'?
the throat, the mouth... its vulnerable spots.
i'm thinkin' maybe i could let it go...
marcie.
where's the other guy?  buzz.
who does that new kid think he is with that coat? bo diddley?
you don't owe me a goddamned thing, vincent, and you know it.  you stepped in front of a bullet for me.  i owe you a heavy debt.
what's up?
i bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for christ sakes. your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. and when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
what do you think?
well, i got annie all warmed up for ya...  she's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
so, should i call andy?
of course it is. what else could it be?
this one's a story, but i'm not going to tell you what it is. every time i tell you anything it goes haywire.
why else would she have flown in from newport? it's not like she'd fed ex a six carat diamond.
but he'll hear everything we're saying.  and if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
what am i supposed to tell brady? sorry, but i've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
every time you and marlon--
uh-uh, just cops.
by red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, colonel?
fifty cents? sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
it wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  then tan got hold of one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
my date always pays more attention to you than to me.
he's right. a predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
i'm right with you, man.  he's got the heart of a lion.  hey, how 'bout the first game of the series?
"i do solemnly swear--that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that i take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that i will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which i am about to enter. so help me god."
it was bo, sir te's man.  i hear he followed the thief to the yus'.
how come you keep askin'?
i tell you, the best thing i can do right now is find out more about you.  what your strengths are, your likes...  everything.  what's your best subject?
oh, ruthie, what am i going to do?
it's your fault! you brought daniel webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! you played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! you can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- i don't want to -- to talk to you again!
only you would think of that!
i just stopped in to say hi.
thank you.
excellent. we shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. i want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities.
well, now, maybe you won't have to.
i'm so comfortable with that, walt, i can't <u>tell</u> you...
i waited another four minutes.
i'll get you some coffee.
what can he do, he's clean...
barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  pretty soon there won't be one place in brooklyn i can hang my hat.
simon, what's happening?!
company outing or picnic or something like that.
no, she's all right. she's still here. but i'll get her home soon.
congratulations, field agent kensington!
when was this?
ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
it's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? it's really hard on my mother. the doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. he says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
was there somebody in your room when i called you?
oh, god, i <u>knew</u> it was stupid, i <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. but the gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. right on top of the bag. yes. yes. we took the gameboy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
an american film about the mafia called 'see you next wednesday', and i want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
and if possible, i'd like to marry someone from pasadena.
i had it pulled. people callin' all the time.  who needs it -- who'd you wanna call?
hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? aw, no, i mean... i mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
is it an ongoing case?
are civilians inside?
i think you did alright by god under the circumstances.  your people are here for you, laz. this is your home. no shame in showing your face.
which one for tomorrow?
why are you always leaving me, harry?
yeah.
well, it's almost over.  we've gone to school together for three years... i might cut that part out.
yeah!  gold!  how much?
you're just gonna walk?
are you intelligent?
we have got to close the beaches. we have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... it's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
was it sister marguerite?
of course, there's that to discuss. refill?
no.  i think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
wow!  does this pole still work?
i can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
doctor gynde. my whole family's sick. what's going on?
hey, what's this with the door? there isn't any lock.
you talk them into it?
believe me. it's me. it's really me.
i saw you out there. you want him to call you back, need you.
but how am i to know the good side from the dark?
i think it might be helpful if you'd send me to miami.
what the hell is that thing doing out there? you're not taking that body anywhere.
you know i need to use you.
eggshell with romalian type.  what do you think?
to misery.
this trucker? met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. he's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. his tongue. sucks it right down.
...to dorothy!
last time paul was sick they gave connie the weekend news instead of me.
you talked funny when you went to school here. you talked funny all the way to high school!
two americans have been killed on united states government property -- this is our investigation.
just a moment...  go ahead.
i hate boats.
maybe you'd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself, nigel?
who?
at a horse show.
did you love him?
trust me huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. now have you given any thought to that peace and freedom party thing. they really want to hook up with us. do a rally together. hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
see, that's the thing...i am what i say i am.
i never pay for anything. they just keep me here to amuse the guests.
i'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
yes.
good.  from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. got it?
that is...chief inspector lee.  the detective in charge of our investigation.
what are you going to do about it, shoot me?
something else. do most attacks go unreported?
i don't know... i'm getting these <u>cramps</u>!
let us say that it is my request. that is a much more pleasant word.
can we dream?
he has a wife and kid.  that's how we'll get to him.

mmm, what. i know better than to argue romance with a french woman.
i must be destroyed.
i'm only human, you know.
mind if i use the bathroom?
i'm a bargain.
he drove me mad!
skipper, sorry to bother you.
oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? was it romantic?
listen to carla...marry me...i'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
you know, for when you travel.
inside? why should i give house- room to your sort?
excuse me, but how old are you?
i don't know who i am.
i have a confession. when we met...
i might find the truth rather hard to understand?... can you go back?
hot dog! just like an organ.
herr mozart, what brings you here?
nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. there were never any witnesses.
hey, you! farmer! half-speed there...
is she all right?
is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
baby, you didn't have to come.
i know your face. are you an actor?
who from work?
damn! we gotta skedaddle!
before tony, you and your sister were best friends. i couldn’t split you up. if your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. if you threw up--.
i know it hurts. but it won't be long. then all the pain will be over. oh, i wish you could hear me. god, give her the ears to hear me so she knows i don't want her to hurt so!
i don't think so.
i'm listening.
everything.  i'm a goddamn human-pinata...
aside from everything else, your family all right?
the porter...what's his name? old asbestos --
before i became involved with paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  playboys. thrill seekers. middle aged peter pans who only brought out the worst in her.
yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over.
hello, darling.
this is what they call the jack. hi, jack!
that's nice, grandpa. why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
what's there to do at the point? god, lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
he's right.  maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, john.  a full and thorough investigation ... we've cooperated with the fbi, we'll cooperate with the senate.  what do we have to hide?
it'll be ok - i know those guys. they won't stiff you.
that's kazanski.
daddy, i don't want to get into anything with you tonight. i'm tired and i...
aren't you listening, man?  love gives you wings.
i can't believe this. why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
lieutenant's bought the farm. where's the sarge...?
not new--my doctor faustus.
just don't physically...  fantastic tip -- fantastic.
in the casino.
that gives you an idea of what i'm up against!
did you hear that strange music??
well, yes. i did. clearly he was injured and bled.
if you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  if you get an oscar, i get the left foot.
it's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. there are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  cal ripken even applauded.
ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
sure.
yeah. he's so cool and mysterious.
just give it to me.  i'll remember.

no.
where do you think i might find maurice?
i love it.  she's got a hundred million bucks.  she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  and she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
i don't want to stay here...
sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell i'm talkin' 'bout.

no trick to it.  just stop running the program.  leaving them unattended.
oh, it's even more wonderful then.
you want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
perfect for a child.
i don't feel anything.
mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
i feel right now like there's one burning in me.
mr. harris.

are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? they say you did.
can i give you my testimony?
all i ever wanted was to sing to him. that's his doing, isn't it? he gave me that longing - then made me mute. why? tell me that. if he didn't want me to serve him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? go on, tell me! speak for him!
underwear?

that's a crock of shit.
attorney for the plaintiff?

i'm not kidding.
look...
you just told me you hadn't seen her.

he wouldn't say.  edward... i think we got him.  his nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  you there?
ok...this is good.  our first solid lead.
i don't mean that! why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! ain't never gonna make you happy! never made warin' happy.

i wish i had that luxury. i'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can't go, because you won ' t.
then find another theater
you know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
make a note of that word and give it to susan. i think it's rather touching really. here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when i know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
no -- i was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
go on, major.
mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  i'm not complaining. that's the mark of a man.  but...  you see, i... i wouldn't want to be... be left alone. i don't think i could bear being left alone.  i... forgive me. this business with the birds has me upset.  i... i don't know what i'd do if mitch weren't here.
no thanks.

serafine...
too heavy.
i came after the woman i love.
she was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
that little girl? ha.  now go on, get me some tools.
this brothers is gonna be a colossal event. we'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  will you cool it? what's up man? what it be bobby?

i can't help you, plank.
because i know what it says.
you're a kind man to be sure.
no.
she's saving herself for you.
but why do you call me 'mr. di vita'? it didn't used to be that way...
and you like it?
does that have a hidden meaning?
what's that?
look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  like a bowstring.  it was built from both ends.  with no support in the middle.  beautiful.
nick... you up?
well, i ...
okay...  okay, now what.
but i thought, i don't know, i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
oh, my god, are they vegetarians? that's not in here...
lay off of that stuff, son. it upsets your mother.
wouldn't miss it.
...look at that. twin cities.  ids building, the big glass one.  tallest skyscraper in the midwest.  after the sears, uh, chicago...  you never been to minneapolis?
but you haven't lost your mystery! you're very mysterious!
fair enough.
that was beautiful.

the lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
you're too late.  say bye-bye birdie.
please, the children.
it's a lie!
case... are you okay?
i found a broken gasket, from space --
[what's the pin number?]
my mother and i used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  the queen's house-. the gangster's house-. the clown's house- like that.

except, you're willing commit murder with them.
oh yes, of course. there was someone with me. a lady.
what do you mean ?
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose. for you to help me.
i'm sorry, i just hallucinated.

"tortious interference"? sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
because you'll never believe me.
skip the art criticism, tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
i go running down there.
she's not property, john, she's a person. were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
yeah, i saw the border. through binoculars from on top of a high building. that's about as close as i risked getting. what's the tv say?
cheap, cheap, cheap.
yeah? about fifty people i didn't know wrote that in my annual.
i won't wait up.
woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. she called the police and they came over and arrested me. thought i was a sniper! boys at the vfw loved that one. cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. i was gonna put out poison, but i was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. hell, i had six cats myself. so i used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
commander, these are some of the most famous people in starfleet! admiral kirk, my god!
i can't believe this!  <u>i</u> sleep in coffins!

they couldn't break the riddle.

i don't think you understand.
it's a nice day.  how about the beach?
look! it's bruce!!  allies -- the balloons. we've got to find some way to tell him!
a monster?  but he built this for the woman he loved, like the taj mahal.
how...
wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
i'll see you in an hour, max.
then why didn't they take it.
what are the police doing?
. . . what?

well, i know what my daddy's going to say.
you okay?
space lab?! wait'll i get my hands on yllo.
well, i understand.     i know my behavior was poor.
but let me tell you, man, i don't like your attitude already.
but, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned watergate.  we're clean.  it's only the ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
i'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, craig schwartz...
what the fuck are we going to do?
you mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  i can't think of anything.

well... what the fuck, man?
i said i have illegitimate children. i don't know how many.
whew...okay, hand me those padlocks.

who are you, jerry?
well, about six months ago -- i was going to night school, taking this course in advanced accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so i gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing i knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
a... are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
hello.
oh man. that's universally stupid, man!
where are you going?
no, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  i don't have luck with women. there was this girl i met while i was in college.  i slept with her once.  she started following me around, taking my picture.  she dyed her hair, copied my clothes. lisa something... oberman.  it was awful.
of course, one must admit he has great courage.
"big and older"?
now what?
anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
yeah, but not in here.
how?
it would serve you right if you were left behind.
why me, man?
promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.

hey.
you really want to do this, don't you?
so go take your job on wall street.

quarantine, possibly.  you may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the american people could do without.  goodbye.
stan grossman looked at your proposal. says it's pretty sweet.
i knew you wouldn't answer. i've been thinking about what you said last time. how me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. how maybe i can't lose the weight, ever...  which we already knew...

ah, here we are. steed asked me to play a hunch:  valentine peel.
a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. you got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - pssshht! -  shish kebabs.  maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  i think i could help you, theo.

oh, i know he didn't, but i wish i could find him...  i have something very important to tell him. macaulay won't help at all.  he thinks i just want money.
hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a gundark.
we're going to tell them what we've found. what we've learned. turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
severance pay.  and i'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.

sorry, it was dark, now come on.
oh, god, she's out there...
i don't recall.
that's right. and the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
thompson!
what color is it?
why'd you want to help us?
wait a minute. wait. whatiya want? for cryin' out loud!
later for you, pal.
i like you, kid. why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
you'll put your clothes here.
so it's love which drags you to moscow.
good.
the trick is not to think about it. see that one? the widow st. clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. she's perfect for you. go ahead.
huh?
i'm leaving!  oh, and austin?
i never doubted for a second that i was.  will you come to the trial, elizabeth?
if i thought i'd offended her, of all people-
i have to go to the bathroom, cynthia.
he took a shot.  he's unconscious.
take a message.
santini will do that for 25 dollars!
look at that.  a white rolls royce. that's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
hell, that wasn't half bad.. get going...i'll keep it busy....
aren't they gauche...?   those steel things are so - common.
exquisite!  you said it belongs to...
what?
how about richard grayson, college student?
mmmmm...
i'll have to run your card off now.
feeling better, my dear?
how about in the morning.
it's not my voice ... but i know her.
we're not making blair witch ii here.
[you want to talk, lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
son of a bitch. get over here.
where's your stuart from? somewhere near there, isn't it?
how'd you know that, lowell?
we don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
i don't know if it's coincidence, but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u2 program from his days at atsugi air base in japan.  six months after he arrives in russia, francis gary powers' u2 spy flight goes down in russia.  that plane was untouchable. powers hinted that oswald could've given the russians enough data to hit it.  as a direct result, the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed.  i can't help thinking of that book seven days in may, maybe someone in our military didn't want the peace conference to happen, maybe oswald was part of that.  it gets weirder.
"g.g. market one-eight-four-two."
hi honey.  what's going on?					*
almighty jove in the shape of a swan.
hallelujah!  you are my savior, man! my own personal jesus christ!
oh liz. we. god. we, in vegas. micheal crushed her skull. she was dead. there was nothing else to do. it was an accident.
you tried to take your life. you do remember that, don't you?
you don't have to show me anything, mr. rogers.  i believe you.
not a note.
we're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
i gotta get you out of here.
it's not her mind you need to change. it's disneyland head in there.
emergency transmitter?  all your gear is back at wilder's.
mr. spock?
but you were with me.
joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? we're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to south america and hide out in one of those banana republics -  the way i figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  did we forget anything?
my guess is that she turned him down.
what happened to his eyes?
where are we going?
how old are your kids?
when...what did you do?
35% on the math final !  no one could be that dumb with numbers.
there are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
i'm hungry for a proper visit.
were you with jamie?
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
yes.
have *you*?
nah-nah-naw! you done done finally done it! like a man done it. done it right. i love you, you mean sonofabitch!
donnie darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
whatever you say, dil.
i've got you floored... we're off ... take the curb... man, can you corner... know not to get on it ... momentum shift ... don't get on those brakes too hard ... get her up on her tires. up on her toes. up ... up... up.
i don't think so, claude. you'd just slow me down. we'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. there's no way around it, you're soft.
so this guy walks into a bar and says...
i'd better go on home now, it's late. i have to work tomorrow.
twenty minutes?
i can't. i just left home.
so simple to say, so hard to do.
you can make your move when it comes after me.
did you just now con me?
you're the computer hacker, you tell me.
not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  hi.  what'd he say?
no, this is great.
that's a good thing?
how'd you manage that, then.
then he's got to be a detective.
yeah.
phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
some things never change.
you promised to come for tea yesterday. i waited for so long.
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera. down somewhere in there scavenging around.
i appreciate that. thanks a lot.
so i'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh captain rob?
that's for sure, frank.
how are you gonna make it without your shoes?
and you don't want to keep him waiting.
what do you think?
i like you.
i mean, i am really attracted to you.
it's okay. i can peddle toilet paper.
i was just telling the woman how i feel, for god's sake.
i'm sorry. i didn't know.
i've heard good things about their london branch.  you have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
shh——— it's all right -— i'll be all right.
how did you get this?
you okay -- ?
if there was any way i could go in your place. but i'm only a monkey and...
you were standing in the middle of the street?
don't worry, it won't last long.
get em....
of course. but since he is ill i'm taking the liberty of asking you.
all right. let's take it from the top.
the craftsmanship is extraordinary.
that's a wig you wear, isn't it?
please don't wash your hands in the sink.
i've seen him.
there's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, mrs. mulwray. the coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. just take my word for it. now i want to know how it happened and why. i want to know before escobar gets here because i want to hang onto my license.
what kind of chromium is it?
jamie wanted that. she told me.
fight what?
come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
hold that lamp up -- i must see her face.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...you ask for miracles, theo...i give you the fbi...
see anything?
actually -- in this dream -- i was your mother.
how's that?
i know what to do about mother.
brainstorm, buzz. i admit, i thought it was a rotten idea, but i put up the scratch.  and now we got a beautiful thing.
maybe you inspire me.
no cop can come in here without a warrant.
no.
and on such an occasion, i feel a completely traditional program will be best.
oh yeah?
it was an emergency.  i only lied that night because it was the only way i knew to stop her.  i knew if i didn't, i'd never see her again.
kareem's in the wash. i need a favor.
yes, generally, to see pap. however, point number two: a brief tenure in hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
come on, i'll buy you a drink. there's a big thing over at the italian embassy.
you don't know what it's like. herr mozart frightens me. he drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
where?
road's in!
thanks, clark, but i'm booked for the night.
yes.
he was here.  you fell asleep.  we took him.  you looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  besides, the young woman, julie, is with him.  believe me, everything is fine.
and finally, they're not human beings, you know. their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
please join us.  come on forward.
is he still working here ?
mommy, i'm scared.
what are you doing?
so what's the argument?
edward wood, sir.
i don't give a fuck about your parents --
who's been giving you history lessons?  your bartender?
i think you're quite handsome.
mr. corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of arizona? or any gambling interests in that state?
gee... that's wonderful, jill.
they'd never talk in front of me. they'd walk away up the beach. nervous about something.
evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  what i feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  if i don't come back, i don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
hear that, dodge? epps don't think it's a problem.
i ain't blamin' her, ned, i ain't holdin' it against her.  she knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch i was... an' she won't allow how i've changed. she just don't know how i ain't like that no more.
are you ill?
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
sure you do.
i see.  then who is after you?  what sins have you committed?
life is unpredictable.
mmm.  like kissing a rose.  well, au revoir.
oh, we'll have to do better than that.
i just realized.  i'd never seen his face.  i guess it was just a matter of time.  he's totally -- daniel? what's wrong?
she still with kent?
t.j., what're you doing?
vampira!  hi, this is ed wood.
oh. and that is -- mom?
what for?
yeah, it's working out real good.
take the airport subway, but change at jordan station for kowloon tong.
oh yeah.  see, susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  oh no.  the big house does things to a man.
get the car.  i'll be leaving in ten minutes.  where's calo?
can i... um... have some water?  please?
the union don't run my house.  those anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
you're not going in there -- !
colonel greenhill's compliments, sir. the colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of rangers in the field, fully armed and...
no, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
and what went on your little party in atlantic city. i got ears.
listen. i got to be on the sidelines during the game... you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
eve!  this guy is un-be-liev-able!
benjamin?
shit. wrong room.
oh jesus, oh jesus.  man i knew we shouldn't have gone.  i tried to tell you.  i tried to tell you.  you guys made me come!  you made me come!!
you're probably just having a mid- life crisis. did you buy a porche?
well?
that sounds good.
you're touchy, sidney - don't be so touchy...
ellie, i should have done this a long time ago, certainly before i left the n.s.f., but i wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
you shouldn't play this game.
because. cynthia, look, john was right. graham is strange. very strange. you don't want to get involved with him.
now for the real question.
com'on, tell me.
magic...
daddy, it can't be just because of that.  there had to be other factors.
"and" what?
yes sir i was.
yes.
yeah, like the bird.
and to think i am teaching you to become one of them...
you have a strange way about you... i mean interesting.  i'm sorry.  it's really none of my business.  it's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  if david saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  that's how he is.
very well. exercise caution, lieutenant. this landing is captain's discretion and i'm the one who's out on a limb.
no... but...
what's the matter with you?
i received a telegram from hermann goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor. i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. after the dreadful events of november 1938, the violent attacks on the jews, i stopped using the title.
louder, please. we cannot hear you.
why?
no big deal. i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine... i mean, i did write the program for it.
want to say goodbye to the colonel?
he wouldn't take it on the helicopters. he'd transport it through pipelines that connect chemco to the waterfront...
you think these are tits don't you?
the money? why?
give me the keys!
...look, you're confused? you need guidance? talk to another writer.
tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
yes, ma'am.
what do i gotta do?
no, sir, you did not.
before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. the rest is history.
where is it?
it is the work of untouchables.
that won't be easy, my friend ... what brings you here, anyway?
the document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form.  it's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
you're kidding me.
well, she is getting on, but she's fine. i told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. she called to find out how you are.
so why are you wasting your time in a small town? you're a big man. you should be in the big city.
that's what i...
will you please stop fighting?  just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. you got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
all the failures, all the fatalism.
i know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting new york?
so tell me, do you like ron? is it serious?
do you not hear the wind in the trees?  the songs of the birds.  the horses breath?  there is a whole world around you. alive.  living.  feel it -- become part of it.  live your life, highlander.  it's going to be a long one.
couldn't be, i checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  i tell you this time it's not my fault.  i'm sure i checked it.
i'll never make it... can't we stop just for a few minutes...
i'd never ask you for money, you know that. i don't even like talking about it - money, favors - i find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
are you sure? 'cause if you want, i'll bring back the whole store for you.
maybe.  why?
you think i don't know that?
don't you touch him.
our group is full.
i guess inside. or he never made it. either way, i don't give a shit. let's get this over with.
sir.  i thought those records were sealed.
you're light a deuce.
there must have been somebody.
those things in your hands.
dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
the other one like you...
he did?
lucille? where do you get that?
and if the teeth aren't suzie's?  you'll give this up?
what? how do you know my name?
you all right, ethan?
now?  now?
you quit drinking?
what for?
this ain't a little feud, earl, it's world war two!
did you know him very well?

hey, you know, what can i say, i dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
he's my brother...
carter.
i wish i could tell you. i can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. i'll notify the cdc and --
yes.
yes!
oh, shit, shit, shit - i don't know about all this! you sure?!
you know anything about the stations here?
you know where my father is, don't you, miss boatwright?
...what?
you look lovely.
i want a name.  a real name.  this thing's full name, rank and serial number.
help! help! i'm drowning!
oh. it looks like a hearse.  very nice. compact.
saunders--if there was *any* way--
where'd she go?
you know what i mean.  i'm getting married soon, but i haven't lived the life i want.
if things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
huh?
when did you start to feel this way?
you want to know what i think?
hell yes - walk. you're meeting the president, aren't you?
i can't.
reiben, i don't know what i'd do without you.  sarge, keep ryan close to you and alive.
oh.  the navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
are you dining on worms?
i'm coming.
same thing, daddy. mommy says --
what should i be, a white inferior- ist? a multicultural zulu egalitarian? let me ask, where are your people from?
how romantic.  with fiona i fell over every five minutes.  ronnie christened me lady downfall.
really? tell me about it.
i walk in the house and before i can say "how are you?", "did you have a nice day?" before i can say anything.   pow she's out the door.
we've got to get you out of here.
major, major... he's here ...
what?
and i'm his ticket.  what's the last place they took down?
good woman.  i trained her right.
she can't see you, right?  in the book, rule number two: the living usually won't see the dead.
the other one?
he loves you too.
it's so very cold...
and as a father, i worry about him.  in medieval stories, agent myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
he says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  why not come back then and listen for yourself.
oh, god, i hate this job.
i thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
drink?
well. if mary beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
and jim.
yeah.
so you were at berkeley.
we are?
mother keeps hers in southampton - and dad took his to venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
oh warren...oh warren...take me, god take me...
i want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
what about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
i'm going to daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
did you find jane and mandy?
i can't believe you didn't notice. my weight.  i lost ten pounds in rome
we're supposed to go to the lake.
you fucking liar!
come with me and i'll let her live.
you show no inclination to speak otherwise!
cut up a woman. cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, i guess.
closer?  i can try.
i'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
you know him?
listen to you!  you sound like betty, all pissed off because archie is taking veronica.
i'm not mushing it.
he's really not a bad fellow.
i brought you here to talk about him. do you know him?
listen, i'm not going to go to that little reunion party. i'm meeting lynette at the motel.  best head in fifty-two states. after three days of survival training, how could i resist?
well that's two things to strangle stephen for. where is he, anyway?
yeah, i know. just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
tunnel?
-- we'll tell them what happened --
what is your name?
little bit.
son?
oh, dear, dear.
i'm here.
hanging is nice. never goes out of style. what about hare-kare - a taste of the orient? but no! you're in paris! try the guillotine! there's one in the louvre!
you mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. she also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
why would i want to sell my passport?
you like it?  it's my first.
...i'd be lying to you if i did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
we'll hop a plane tonight. an island ceremony. an abba dabba honeymoon!
he didn't give you an address? he didn't give you a phone number?
you – must – open – me – up – again?
he's going to kill you, aramis.
alright, we're gonna carry you...
he certainly is polite.
we're already over mach 2!
max, if we lived in california, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
.... miser stevens' soul, mr. stone. yes -- i am sorry for the disturbance.
don't you think you should at least wave?
oh.
you don't remember?
kitty, i would appreciate... if you could wait...
the great state of florida. people came here fer years ta die. retire and expire. the rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. hah! now this here's the new capital o' the world! hah! they came here...died...went to hell...and the devil sent 'em back as an army. hah! general gasparilla's army...my army!
what was my mama like?
it was great for me, how was it for you.
what do you mean?  didn't you come back here for it?
i'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch tv and go to bed.  then tomorrow i'll get up and go to work.
kids.  ten seconds of joy. thirty years of misery.
are you okay ? any holes ? i mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
no.  he's not depending on luck.  you've seen that.  we walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied victor to the bed, to the day.  to the day! because he wanted us to.
please, sir!--come with me!
thank you, sergeant major. thank the men.
he did the best way he knew how, junebug is stubborn just like you.
the woman's surrounded by fools!  she has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
barefaced.
i need to talk to you.
great.
--and that mr. marsh paid less attention to you?
so where's all your stuff?
we get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
i have written repeatedly to mrs. redi. she vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  it is six months since your tuition has been paid, mary. naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
i don't know.
what time is it?
is this disease common in the tropics?
what is it?
i - i...  i can't, michael.  there's stuff --- at the clinic -
you were in insurance before the war.
shall i begin by executing the president's daughter? she's right here.
hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
it can louse up your insides. you can get puh, puh, puh...
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
i just remembered.  you were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
also i'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
mr. president, how the hell did you get on board?
be quiet, boy.  i got to figure this thing. i'm thinking. it can't be done at the house. it should be...
i love you, will, beyond poetry.
trinity?  the trinity?  the trinity that cracked the i.r.s. kansas city d-base?
abrams.  yes.  how are you today?
god, i don't know who's weirder, you or me.
a venison pie as big as a house.
beth.
yeah? what?
you're fast.
it's for the mining industry, mr. cunningham. we can talk about business later. but first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
now they feel it...down below.
i guess i just don't understand anything.
right.
sheriff just radioed me. i'm gonna check out a possible lead. thought you might like to join me.
why do you keep doing this?
nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
relax.  we're almost there.
we'll think of something.
warsaw radio. i was a technician. i saw you almost every day.
i miss my kids.
quiet, will you? this is ser- ious. our lives are in danger.
i'll be damned if i'm leavin'. that band is too good?
what are we going to do?
this time, <u>i'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
well... it's true.
you don't have to tell me that. it's just, i know my bid was low, but was it too low?  i mean, did i seem like an amateur, like i didn't know what i was doing?
mr. lombardo from packaging wants to meet on friday.
yeah, everything's under control.
that's always tough. how long were you together?
sir, i --
apparently he has the letters.
look, i loved "exposed!" and i hate it that you got busted. i know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not that bad.
that's all you can say?  what are you talking about?
you're making me feel guilty again.
i was buzzing, i was knocking, but i guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
say!...what happened to your blanket? lose it?
hi, jack.
a little birdie told me.  good day, miss daniels.  madam. 
i want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
i just wish he never brought it up. ricky won't shut up about it.
right.  well, i wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  i'm claire spencer.  from next door.
honey, did you know that the albatross was captured by the germans during world war ii?
like i should talk. monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. i'm really sorry about that whole woody allen thing...
oh... has your luggage been brought in?
christ, i'm getting bored.
by yourself?
here you are.
who told you that?
well, rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
get moving--
you think i should take lessons?
it didn't go off.
and every cat's watching, ain't they? it's a toe-down.
people still need values, beliefs....
well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
i was at hand.
mank! you scoundrel! what took you so long?!
excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
what kind of concerns?
i was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
listen, stupid, could i do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
i'm sorry. it's just upsetting. you're in love with her. you don't love me anymore.
hit me with your best shot.
well, jeffries, why come to us about it?  why don't you go up to the houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
i wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
what?
what?
oh, it's so soft.
you put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
nobody's going to hang.  we're all gonna walk away with a little something.  i ain't a greedy man. and, hell, you did all the work. one-hundred-thousand dollars.  split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  give or take.
pass them potatoes, lincoln.
look, why don't you and lila stay here and have your natural life. i'll just go on my way. you'll never see me again.
i'm sorry. daddy and mommy are a little upset.
shell oil?
oh, hi.
where were you, jake? where've you been? why haven't you called?
all right, mr. appleton.  that was what you knew then.  what do you know now?
count to twenty.  when you get to twenty open the hatch.  it can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
woody!  it's the moving van.
i don't get it.
oh, wonderful.  my secret weapon is - pms.  that's just great.  thanks for telling me.
you call.
we didn't ask for your opinion, doctor.
jack.  did you compose that yourself?
so?
oh god, lenny.  i was trying to keep you out of this.
who's the best? say it.
but you don't even know me. how can you care what i do with whom?
my married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  i couldn't believe it.
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca.
for a second there i thought you were a fanatic.
where's the baby??
you're bothered by your performance on the <u>kobayashi maru</u>.
we can't raise the wheel without it.
why did they block the door again?
who's been giving you weird looks?
not in this thing.
well... if you're sure that i could accomplish everything in a week... i suppose i could manage it.
no.
hello, case.
what's it about?
you want me to stay?
i don't know who that is.
no honey.
you don't know, walter?  you seem to know the answer to everything else!
that's why it just mauls and tears at them.
i'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  say, you might be able to help me.  when she used to talk about kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about rosebud?
and no ac.
well, i really think he's got a chance.
we missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, i just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. i really liked you, doolittle.
where's mandalay?
mr. lipnik, i really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
no.  yes, of course i'm mad, because you love me, i know that.
yeah, another round thing.
someone else was there.
you... suck!  you almost got us all killed!
kill that poor woman.
no, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the partridge family.
hey, bomb...
if i do it, can we go?
lonnegan after you, too?
i took it from my fake husband.
you just don't get it, do you, austin? good night. welcome to the nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
hey. you don't know that shit for sure.
something has happened to them. let's try this way...
then why are you here?
i should hope not.  i hate you!
huh-huh. you?
now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
mr. m., i am running on my qualifications.  i would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... plus, my own best banner was torn down.  did i do that too?
-- yeah?
jacques?  i'm pregnant.
disturbed. and when your friend crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
twenty-six, twenty-seven.  so far so good.
you talkin' to me about ramada inn?
i don't need any money for the baby. i'll be fine.
that's the whole thing. you know if you look at it. i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. and everyone's dying. and you better wear a condom or else. but the truth is. i don't know any kids with aids. no one i know has ever died from that shit. it's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
so what are we gonna do about this?
he finished it.  he wrote the worst notice i ever read about the girl he loved.  we ran it in every paper.
we put our lives on the line today. malcolm x's widow was on the line today. and your guns weren't even loaded.
i don't really know how --
you mean this, sir?
good idea.
that wasn't jack's fault.  no, that was on account of buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  she called the fbi and they both went down, ended up at lompoc.  i think buddy felt kinda bad about that.
but he was such a good cop.
i don't believe this.
well, i'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
i'll give you ten seconds.  he is going to give us a practical demonstration of what i feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or i'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
sir. excuse me, sir. i'm sorry to have to wake you. are you a doctor?
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
sandra sinclair.  wanna know her real name?  bella iskowitz.  no one's who they really are, jer. everyone's someone else.  even you. even me.  especially me.  i'm peter appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
...what?
joe, give my nephew a drink.
good, now the other side.
how do you reconcile the two?
well? how do you like it?
watch it!
what's that got to do with it?
eleven.
dammit you’re persistent.  i don’t want to listen to this anymore.  no more bets with you.
what about me?
after i called in, i had a chance to sit down with the three locals. they swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... it might be alive.
but i don't know anything!  really.  i just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  he ...
i got it from here.  thanks.
well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. i don't want to ruin your willpower.
when i'm talking to children.
i know it's busted.  what did i just tell you?
i hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and i had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
what?
oh, yeah?
i guess so.  well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
well, shall we get down to it?
by the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
fifty million dollars. fifty million. we gonna let this guy just take it from us? one guy?
...the ice cream for money!
they don't feel like you're in construction.
what?
ron told me that bob haldeman's been calling.  but you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
it is.
do you know where she might be?
you're in show business?
good evening. i'm detective inspector mccall and this is dc mitchell. i wonder if we could ask you some questions.
you wanna leave, man?  let me take care of ganz all by myself.
gonna be le hot shit.  pardon my francais.  dance club.  the resurrection brothers play there.  heard of them?
i don't like horror comics.
well, i-i hope that--that--
ok, how did you know?
i feel the heat from your skin and the stubble on your chin you're no good
i knew we'd pay for it.
what glasses were you wearing?  were you wearing your reading glasses...?
yes...
they can't convict us of that. you proved our innocence. besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
i'd really rather not say.
at this size, i would certainly think so.
come on, will...
my prop guy, had a guy out here.
that's very funny, sir. you are under arrest.
three minutes. we're going in light. myself and two others. everyone else is held back in reserve.
none.
i'm sorry charlie.
you still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
bavmorda cannot transform you. i've protected this camp with a spell.
the car doesn't vanish evan. the movie in your head has broken, that's all. but now i've re-spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car.
i'd do anything for you, dil.
most enjoyable. herbert greenleaf.
there you go.  grain of salt.  two sides to every coin.
he shot a hole in the damn ceiling. so what?  you lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
it's a secret so don't tell anyone. some day i'll show you where. i've gotta go to sleep now.
give it back? are you nuts?
yes. yes, they were partners.
well, not exactly.
what do you want to know?
what's on the call sheet?
if i'm right, this happened before the krueger murders in springwood.  that means that jason might've been krueger's first victim.
you must not act impetuously.
can i have my desk please.
come down.
she didn't cone home last night.  we found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
big day coming up--i wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. but he went so unexpected.
negatory.  <u>too many ants</u>.  and while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
yes.
good. it wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. i want my money back.
in an hour they're gone!
wow, i have a clitoris too.
there's the rub.
so anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  i've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
uh...
i told you, i don't know where sidney is. and even if there was a third killer, sidney doesn't know about it.
yeah.   we just go home.
but i've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
actually, i think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
you got to kid. let me spell it out for you. this is a whorehouse. and i happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
i'm stoodup! i'll kill that bastard!
sometimes i wonder how much of him there is in me.
i will close.  john, john, ten percent.  i can get hot.  you know that...
no way.
i can trust rheya.
yeah, overpowering. that was the word i was looking for.
this is not what i requested.
at some point a man's got to get serious about his future. i'm sure you have no idea what i'm talking about.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
i don't know, you just passed out.
so you're staying in tonight?
what?  what did you say?
givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  asshole.
i figured i'd ask you...
was a massacre. soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. bobby peru prob'ly killed the most.
i'll be by saturday to pick him up.
where do you fit in, trimble?
we didn't do nothing, eddie.
huh?
really -- don't do that -- i'm sure this is not his job.
i'm soaked.  oh great.
dr. neilsen.  he'll be - -
your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which i have honorably won.
why are you so concerned?
there are limits?
nothing.
i was thinkin' the del amo mall. in the food court.
i'm serious.
you risk your life when you cross the street.
is there anything wrong?
if the horn be restored the curse is ended.
yes, ma'am.
you're a friend of eduard raban's.
this is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
to tell you the truth, i am frightened too. shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall i carry on the best i can?
if there is, develop it!
selina, are you okay?
hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this mister o'diddle bird right now?
look how big it makes me look.  i look like an alp.
ring it for him, sobo.
what of?
it isn't a broadcast studio. it's -- a surveillance post or something. that's why they have the dishes on top.
alas, that love, so gentle in his view, should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
rough day on the set?
what will you say?
a practical man, sir. given the marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
what do you want to do now?
oh, that's fun.
how?
no.
diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
we are here to discuss our merger. naturally i can make no statement at this time. we must begin at the beginning.
it should.  you nominated him for spec-recon just three days after you nominated me.
oh... look at this... what do you want, snakeskin?
you had a heart attack?
no, sir.
that black car?
mama???
you look pretty healthy to me.
what do you want to do?
what's that?  present from faith?
where did you get those from, a museum?
you don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
i appreciate it, but i don't accept it.
almost there, louis.
what do you mean—starvation?
what do you think?
his name?
so i'm learning.
why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
-- we're kidding ourselves.
he's not a suspect, is he?
i'll try.
yeah. the blaze. i bought her in '66. hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. that horse made me over a hundred grand. in 'sixties' dollars. you know what that is today?
i brought a few of my own.
but the lord came to me
your completely missing the point.
it wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  it wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
please. something is going to happen...
me?  i'm busy.  just finished one script.  i'm due on another assignment.
'bout 4:30.
okay, security -- what happened?
it was a nice try, treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
sweetie, have you ever heard of walt whitman?
you'll be fine.
i'd need an introduction. from someone he trusts. someone who owes us a favor.
it's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
if it's okay with you i'm going to bobby's to do my homework.
no shit?!?! you know him?
well, i am a dead man and buggered to boot. my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of england, while burbage and the chamberlain's men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
i'm just doing it by the book. analyze then vaporize.  crime's a science.  everything's analyzed.
then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! a couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. but--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. just says, "i haven't done anything. why should i resign?" he might *listen* to *you*--
uh-huh. and?
but they'll put me in jail.
you stopped?  why?
no, i don't.
she was at the four seasons last night, man. but you shouldn't worry about that.
come here -
kenilworth.
say it not lightly...  do you know its meaning?
of course you do, and i want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
get your fucking hands off my daughter!
i did. i brought you back here.
martin! ride me as far as the well!
are you listening to me?
well you did it today.
guilty. i am.
how much is a shave and a haircut, roger?
it's santa muerte. death worship. the religion of la hermanidad. there's a curse on you.
how much do you know?
you nuts? let him order? you on his side? you're not such a good waitress. you get out, too.
i'm trying to help you. i knew she'd get her claws into you. she doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. why would i lie? do not go back to her. take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
joe--i'm getting leery of this guy. we keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! i'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from sunday--
yeah.  why?
what-what? where you been the last four five years? outer space?
that's good. you're learning. but let me tell you why i know she was lying.  first off, betty would never fall for a soap star. it's beneath her.
i don't know now. you-you wanna go to another movie?  so let's go see the sorrow and the pity.
yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
tommy!  the guy's a sleaze-bag.  she can't sing.
of course.
maybe.
is this national security stuff boring you?
i do alright.  everybody's happy.
no i won't. i swear.
but he has been there, off course.
i believe you. i believe you want to be with me. but this is not just about me anymore.
what?
what's it going to be?
you have your extracurricular secrets, i have mine.  we'll hold a clarification session soon.  for now, i need your fearsome old habits at the victory motel. we're going to brace a man who may know who killed jack vincennes. can i count on you?
i hate him for what he did to me.
eric, leave it alone.  it's not your business.
put it here.
that morning.  he was talking to me and leon about marriage.
y'all mind the store.
i'm sorry, dave, but in accordance with sub-routine c1532/4, quote, when the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. i must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
i don't know. i want it to be --
but couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
don't be fooled, madeleine! he fears for himself. he's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
how'd they describe her?
man, i'm studying in the man's book. i don't dig half the words.
oh yeah?
do you miss it?
the usual.  plane crash.  survivers unknown.  routine stuff really.
no arbogast. no bates. and only the old lady at home...  a sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
but you suspect.
no.. i mean, i don't have anything on me. this won't be safe.
oh. no. not that way. i'd say it was more -- i don't know --  -- too bad? pathetic?
okay. i'll be talking to you.
i knew stensland and meeks knew each other.  meeks was with sue lefferts on christmas eve.  the night i met lynn.  lefferts' mother i.d.ed stensland as lefferts' boyfriend, but stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
it's no big deal.   we all compare.
do you know what a vampire-king is?
she coulda killed me last night.
i'm pretty sure she did.
he's been repeating that since birdson's exorcism.  i looked in every passage in the bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
that's my capitalization on the annex! *my* operation, ed! christ almighty. that's what i was just talking to doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann.
beautiful all over, eh?
ahh, the luxuries of life.
couldn't get the words out before.
what?
stop. we are not having a "duality" conversation. "ooh, he has a secret side.  ooh, she has a dark side." please.  duality is a joke. you get one, do you understand me?  you get one life. one shot. i'm so tired of women saying "i have an inner strength" or "deep down, i'm really ambitious." "one day i'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if i can only remember to return the videos i rented last night." if you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  you need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. there is no gray area. the truth is not somewhere in between. there are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. we are not having a "duality" conversation.
paris has surrendered?!  i don't believe it.
...gotta...
the guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
you haven't told then, huh?
maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
are you sure you can drive? you've really had a lot of alcohol.
should have seen him the first night.  son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
i've got him if you want him.
boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
the scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
don't blame me. i'm city editor in name only. you do all the hiring around here.
i'm not pushing it.
tuna, this is crap.
you're twenty minutes late.
and if he's not?
no, i absolutely understand. of course.
barak is still strong in the north, and tendo holds the high passes. but the great desert forts have fallen.
when are you boys going to fix that roof?
i sort of like it.
the thought had crossed my mind.
it was me, what?
why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
so am i.
yep. quite a day.
joanna, go fuck yourself!
can't you stop that?
your turn, rudy. you want me to flip for you?
what?
now i got you for a witness, i'm going to try again. so far all i dragged out of him is he's from bahston and he's only been in the army two months.  where were you when they drafted you?
no news yet?
my...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
does mom know you have company?
i didn't say nobody, i said you.
ah, max, you, uh...
a treaty?  don't be ridiculous. what treaty is this?  who made it? who has been giving orders?
it is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
i never noticed his face.
nifty, huh?  goodnight sweet prince, parting is . . . inevitable  now, destroy superman.
the girl that doesn't look like that girl.
what are they doing?
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
torpedo room--?
hello.
not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  you need to get with the program.  seven minutes.  let's get out of here.
for a start. i just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  now why don't you just take your visa express silver card, call karl malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
oh, come off it, man.
you're still angry, aren't you? isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at miss lawson?
i guess i got carried away
understand shit! i though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
getting the yard all fixed up for your party, amy. you'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
-- so yesterday afternoon i take sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
blue? where?
so which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? how do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
john thinks i'm so snotty.
you know, up the jeep trail.
the rich kind.  jeez, man. the way you smoke that shit is suicide.
enid! i'm so sorry about what happened.
be good to your mother, darlin'. she needs you.
i have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
why don't we just rent it for the season?
what's the plan.
that's why right now is a very groovy time, man. we still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
there! that's a true berserk.
over three hundred miles.
no, you look good. i was just wondering.
well, tell him we were here, won't you?
yeah.
ok, nobody shoot. he could still have the unit on him. keep your distance. we don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
who, mr. white?
thank you very much, sir.
yes. under two conditions.
or socks.
sure, e = mc squared. until you factor in more than three dimensions. then... damn. hit us again.
i just wanted to see you.
ya, somethin' like that.
and now?
i thought chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
how's your driving record?
doctor jacobson?
we're not supposed to go back there.
yeah.
but you're out, cypher.  you can't go back.
i hope this is the right move.
well, i think you should tell him you changed your mi...
the memory of who?
okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. they asked me what it was about and i like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, but i told them what i did remember, and the next thing i knew the pages had filled in.
so what do you want me to do?
nah.  maybe.
of course. i planned that, too.
where'd you get this?
if the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the south -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
-- i find it degrading. maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
frank -- stop it!  stop it!
none, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
-- ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
everything i do is under scrutiny. the questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  i'm confused. doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
where?
and video games after!
common knowledge, mrs. peel ...
maybe he's got good taste...i don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
wait just a minute.  what are you trying to pull?!
...i meant your food.
it's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
incredible.
a book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as i git the day, i'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
oh, i had them removed.
wait!  this is boomerang.  this is boomerang.
fuck you. ok, so tommy's got the virus. bad news, big deal. the gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? swanney fucks his leg up. well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
i don't think we've got any suitcases.
go on, fetch.
yes.
who's in?
that's when you need to cement, and define define define.
i can't ...
well, you know stan'll say no dice. that's why you pay him.  i'm asking you here, wade. this could work out real good for me and jean and scotty -
gotta go.
at least kiss me when you do that.
nice to see you.
southern california.
what are you doing?
i won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
my father said i should've gotten a lawyer --!
there's a first time for everything, admiral.
i don't know, ma'am.  he was observed earlier, i believe.
it ain't been a good day, chief.
he's a regular humanitarian. and all this time i thought he was just a tool.
can i ask <u>you</u> something?
you aren't going to hurt me.  you aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
i do.
everybody needs it.  ask prudential.  or allstate.
... well, of course you can.  mr. president, what a surprise.  what brings you here?
well. i stand corrected.
you gave the orders!
how can that be?
christ...  where the hell is the bathroom?
naturally.
it's a scandal, franco.
course not.  i no flum here.  i come flum cathay.
are you coming to eat with us?
innocent!
no part of it wasn't real.
if ye want more tricks, i'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
in-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the cardinal spellman ronald reagan homosexual dance number?
what? where was he?!
i want to report a wrongful arrest.
if it'll make you happy.
where's the boy?
gertrude!
real rain?
what is going on?
a what?
come on, get with the facts.
he just got accepted to the fleet academy. isn't that great ?
well, mr. gardiner, from the sound of our audience, i'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
okay, a blur.
but, never mind.  i am thinking we can do much together.  this problem with diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  to release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. the fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  and i don't like problems.
was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am i wrong? you know, in my own place my name ain't ratso. i mean it so happens my name is enrico salvatore rizzo.
that's it, i'm broke.
yeah. how'd you know?
sure he'll listen. why wouldn't he?
eating junk food.  they don't have a lock on anything, molly. there's not enough information. or i haven't done enough with it...
you're damn right. but the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. what's your name?
i don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
retire.
look, i know he's almost through with treatment here. and, he's on medication.
and to survive, my way, i need money. bobo knows about the stash in the car, so i didn't dare touch it, not if lilly dillon's dead. so that leaves this.
got a wife named angie.
he's right, zack. it doesn't matter.
elbows, son.
i'm still okay.
mr. gower! mr. gower! this is george bailey! don't you know me?
she took a flight to san francisco. we figure she's going to connect to new hampshire; her parents' place.
one condition.
it is very good -- there is no current -- it is very good. i have never seen one like it in all indochina. i was in paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
when was the last time you gave her money for wynant?
the cenobites. the creatures the box set free.  sometimes i think they're still here. just behind the walls. them and their hooks and their beasts. just waiting to break out again. except that i've got the box.
how much you gonna take?
i'm pleased with you, sera... how you have moved up in the world. i showed you a glamorous world when i took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
i'm tryin' to find my jacket.
why you tellin' me that, sheriff?
you don't believe me.
veronica, you look like hell.
not with enough certainty to outweigh british interests in this fort.
i'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
you're from detroit, near where i come from. you majored in education at tuskegee. you're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
amazing, mr. chang. this place is amazing! and that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. oh, i've looked around. i've seen everything. your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
they only made a handful. we're lucky there's even one living in the area...
-- here's a hundred dollars.  and if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
not bad.
yeah, this is sergeant tanaka from holenbeck, i need a current address for a jeffrey....
time for your lesson, vic. chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  ben...
dreams?
none taken.
it's a three-act story with a tragic end.
... too young for whisky...
where are we?
my name's sophia.
that's one thing you are going to learn, shelly, -- how to clean. it takes scrubbing, shelly. there is no easy way. this is where we live, shelly.
shall i light the candles?
you're paranoid, bob.
sensible enough.
no...
no.
shoot.
everything okay, son?
dishwasher? any luck?
he hates me.
now what was your news, baxter?
big girls don't cry-i-eye.
i've never seen anything like him!
i think we should go wake them up. just in case.
no. no. i sent an e-mail to somebody, just now. to tell her how i feel about you.  you know i'm clueless, without you. you know i --
lily, you must listen to me.
well... where is he?
okay.
you're next, norman.
we got time off for good behavior.
the car for debbie?
okay, what the hell are you up to?
evil. the tuaregs and the bedouin believe that hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
mary clarence?  like a guy?  like a dumb guy?
yes, though i doubt he's involved in this.
listen to me.  you have to consider the possibility that god doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  in all probability, he hates you.  this is not the worst thing that can happen...
don't do this.  i am literally begging you not to do this.  chris.
yeah? why?
you gentlemen care for a drink?
he's...what?  say again?  we're in cell hell...
oh, this is big, peter.  this is very big. there's definitely something here.
no.
you think so?
but they will know about it, burke. from me.  just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
it's all real. look.  the storage tanks for the whales.
you don't have to do anything!
so max, what do you do with all your money?
but it's a greenpeace boat. it'd be so easy.
aha. the lovers.
don't mind the smell.  i think a rat died behind the wall... my susie was a good girl!
screw lucy!
you couldn't.
you're kidding.
boyd...i don't know man...it just seems to me that ever since you took tony robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
marsh wasn't alone.  we found traces of sperm on the sheets.  the toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
that's because you don't have any women.
you got to get out of here.  my cell phone's on.  back in the truck.
wait a minute. i know that voice.  you're carjack malone.
why you're here?
who?  who's leaving?
cool. what's it do?
yes.
all right, so that's what we've got. a week.  it's plenty of time.
well, your mother's going to pta today.  we'll see what your teacher has to say. 
it's beautiful.
explain, act crazy?
yes.  it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. do you know what that means?
well... i misunderstood, then.
they'll get him! they'll get him!
faith ok?
will you stand up for me?
noriega is a criminal.
we hear how carl...passed away. only a few hours later.
could be.
you knew just what i was there for.
what did he say?
i know.
hello.  hello, leon.
thank you for coming so quickly.  the guests are starting to ask questions and i'm running out of excuses.
i dunno about this...  what will my mother think?
why don't i believe you?
an hour after...!  deak, for heaven's sake!  let's give her a night in new york city.  we'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
it was... fantastic.
what if it is?
i wished to be reinstated at computer crimes. i was undiplomatic in my request.
is this how?
what's wrong with you!?!
i promise.  we'll talk.  you'll be great.  you'll be fine.  go ahead, just imagine that, uh... just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
so, talk.
you heard about carlton fraser?
reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
who?
tapert.  so, now i've got tapert, butterfield.
luckily.  the closer i watched, the more the fault came into focus.  each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
hey, jack?  bullshit.  i didn't make my first million until i was forty- two.  forty-two.  you really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
well, dr. lorenson is still here at the hospital. if she was here at the time your father was, then i'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
oh, i suck. i suck.
what?
yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
look, man. i don't care if you're putting from the rough. there are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; alexander the great, caeser, shakespeare, oscar wilde, napoleon, gertrude stein, not to mention danny terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
it's an observation.  like:  i'm hungry. when are we eating?
oh, but i have.
twelve o'clock... yes...
you should. a lot of comics play vegas.
because you clash, merrick.  you clash with everything.  i mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'slayers trained her.'  honestly, you look like something out of... pasadena.
just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
excuse me? do i know you, friend? take a look around you. do you even know who i am?
dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  even i don't understand it sometimes.  now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
oh!  oh, zeke!  help!  help me, zeke!  get me out of here!  help!
jeanne... the men are exhausted!
i trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
that should make her happy.
who's that?
...i'm wondering...
in truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
i just got to town.
somebody's mother.
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect. i know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. the first evening i came here in this cafe, i knew there was something between you and ilsa. since no one is to blame, i, i demand no explanation. i ask only one thing. you won't give me the letters of transit. all right. but i want my wife to be safe. i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca.
in the city, it happened all the time -- some kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  call the cops.  what are we, immune?
are you familiar with magnets?
so, adam...where on earth are you from?
but you know how to drive?
the truth is i hate them: they must hate me. all right, the money.  all right, not the money. a kind of put-on. it gets things back together.  well let's say i'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. i mean before -- before i got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. they didn't want me.
what's wrong with him?
he's all right.
i know, i know.  i read the manual. no attachments.  we work alone. blah. blah.
take it now.
i had to go look for this coupon.
...what do you do?
and i'm afraid we want it back.
you sent for me, sir?
you okay?
you sure?
i don't know what's going on.  i don't care to guess.  mac's really unhappy. she isn't there, that's all.  she's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
i'm o.k.  i'm o.k.
– in this corner?
really? no kidding?
i hate to say it...
why?
well, i mean...i know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  let's move cautiously.  first, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
we can take it with us.
all too well, captain.
sir.
you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency. why?
no one.  nothing.  we've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
no, i was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. the whole thing was really... irrelevant. how do you like being married?
this is ridiculous.
sorry about your friend.  and i'm sorry about...
what else did you see- michael...?
you sick?
no, please, i don't --
hey, harry.
i didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
are you coming home?
come on. invite me. all day the idea of a family sunday dinner's been coming into my head. since you're the only one i know around here with family...
no.
no hints, samuel.
just goin' up'ta "tops"... maybe the "ten pin".
we don't have a maid any more.
...insulting people who were in the camps. ...what's the point?
will...i...
we miss you.
how do you feel, dell?
the sky?  where?
c'mon.
no. cut this runaround, doctor. i know better.
to avoid killing anyone.
you only hurt yourself you know?
but you hate each other!
i got a lot more to learn, though. i really wasn't into art when i was a kid.
i said, 'next time, phone ahead.'
and a special thank you to geoffrey and katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. they toast the cliftons.
scratched --  we did not take the initiative.
can i see what you did so far?
isn't this great?  they have everything here.
fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear.
what's the matter? what's happened?
what's that you say, son?
is he dead?
leave him alone, peter. he's in love.
you ain't from oz.  oz is in that one movie.
hey, slow down. this is my brother's car.
oops. sorry.
stinks. i could never figure --  i could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
good luck, sebastian.
that's a lie, lieutenant...  anybody that says that is a liar.
when i was a little kid, i used to want to go to europe but right now wherever i am i'm gonna be in europe.
mr. dawson, i --
can you show us the way?
are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
your home address. oh, just the town will do.
no, but he was on the moors.
kinda early for christmas, bugs.
she's my...cousin.
ahh.
my lady, this play will end badly. i will tell.
he was hurt, but not seriously.  he'll be fine.
y'know my lady lucindy?
it isn't a matter of liking.  it's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. would you mind leaving?  no woman ever walks out on harold ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
how often do you go?
fuck me.
why didn't you tell me?
to stop the killing.  to stop the vampires.
mantids can mimic. we gave the judas that code...
there's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- i can't wake her up.
i'll get a dewars rocks... 
not everything is an illusion.  my hand... wasn't that real?
you're clean.
oh, yes.
you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  so, what are you doing here?
this is still a script we're talking about, right?
oh. geez.
lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? did you use that beanshooter again?
general mann -- i was told to expect you, sir.  i'm colonel heffner.
thank you very much, deputy minister.
'asian dawn movement?'
raise 500.
okay to proceed.
steady... steady, boys. keep scanning...  i thought you people were reliable... where the hell is he!
well, i was just thinking about this john doe business. why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
well, yes, of course.  it's great over here.  you'll meet all the greats.  james dean.  buddy holly.  'the little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
i said i hope she's a runaway. better that than she just disappears like so many others do. sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. a lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. these are realities.
i had a good time tonight, miles. i really did.
okay lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
what's the message? my light is blinking.
you've got to let us try, skipper --
yes.
good to see you're feeling better.
you're not listening to me! i ain't done nothing wrong. people pay to see your monster, mr. treves. i just take the money.
what the hell you looking at, girl?
is it hot in here?
show up for <u>what?</u>
you stole a trans-am.
listen, i know i'm just being neurotic, but i can't shake this suspicious feeling about that italian secretary, ms. fagina. i mean, i don't want to sound paranoid, but i've had some bad relationships in the past, and i have some jealousy issues. you went to her penthouse. it makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but i can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. i'm sorry.
we gotta whole pot inna kitchen. we give you a plate-a your own.
if you like, i'll go with you to dinner.
you disgust me... even if what you say is true.
uh-huh i'm sure. i've killed someone! oh my god i've actually killed someone!
you're takin' a helluva chance kid.
aha! what'd i tell ya!
okay, we'll split up.  you go to every romantic place you guys have, i'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
hey! it doesn't matter! you gotta make your own way in the world! don't be sorry for me! i'm going to get what i want don't you worry!
well?
this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, mr. richard?
it's rundown, all right. but drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  let's see what you did, rembrandt.
leaving was a business decision. we're both rich, come enjoy it.
i started to say... inside...
for what he made me go through.
where did you come from?
here?
i missed you.
fine.
i'm sorry...  ... and what about louise? you mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
who's your suspect?
what?
we're waiting on you.
ahhh!! the wine cellar!! in a bottle of chateau margaux. a metal cylinder... don't... don't - aaaah!
darcy. benny's little sister.
you mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest joe?
what the hell did you expect me to do? just forget about you?
what? what are you talking about?
do you live here in the hotel?
we're going.
street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at oxbridge.  they kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. i've won enough money to do what i've always dreamed.
oh. uh. hello. i -- i have these. for you.
i do it all the time. bust their fucking balls.
excuse me?
i can't say that.
my kid sister.  she just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
hedy lamarr?
fine. more eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
you love him?
no, you gonna give her a robinson's/may bag this time?
you want to give me your gun now, plato?
my two favorite girls.
we don't even have a dog!
the bottom falls out of the sword business!
if it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
this shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with maxie.
what are ya gonna do, call the cops?
the new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, jean-luc. we've destroyed forty-seven borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  but one of the borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for earth. can you handle it?
we're working.
i assumed because of the train.
jill, i'm just trying to be helpful.
--millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  it'll just get everybody in trouble.
oh yeah?
please understand me. when i say she didn't tell me anything about it, i mean not until a little while ago. she thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
loretta. what's that smell?
so you've made up your mind to go to the party.
something must have gone wrong. i guess i'll try number two.
go away! you've spoilt it.
and i don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
okay.
you only made half your quote this year.
susie?  susie.  are you alright...?  <u>susie</u>...
an excellent quality.
paul...  ...i have to talk to you.
then make it so. have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
we know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
i heard what you did.
you knew the deal. no contact.
but there isn't a b-2 bomber.
what's to be scared about?  it's just a little hiccup in the power.
i'm on at nine.
this is all your clothes?
look, i got a rule.  i don't talk to lawmen.  dog-catchers neither.
your mother, and your father
wait, this isn't the way.  who are you?
yeah?
give us your money.
yes, i don't want you ever to leave this house.
think the tide's with us?
yeah.
that's my job too.
look--five men controlled that slush fund as creep--three of them we've got, mitchell, stans, magruder, and we're pretty sure of kalmbach.
what for?  we've got a job to finish ...why are you making the monitor?
no mac, please... i --
i don't know anything about these things, jorge ...
i'm complimenting you. can't you ever just say "thanks"?
i ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
lieutenant, you are looking at the only starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
do you have children?
i talked with your father last night.
hello?
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. orwell's here and now, he's living large. we have no names, man, no names. we are nameless. can i score a fry? thanks.
no. not just a track. you gotta listen to the trees, man. to the leaves. to this sand, you fbi's kicked all up. you gotta listen to the earth.
um, yeah, i was gonna ...
... i'm...  ... i'm very grateful that you're here, chauncey...  ... with us ...
goddamn, miles, she is nasty. nasty nasty nasty.
the cops were all over my house.  they'll kill me for sure.
sit down.
thank you.
shelly was skimming from the business. he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out. he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
and how does one go about getting these human documents, may i inquire?
that ain't what i mean.
oh. right. won't you have a seat?
you mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
not your style.  is it eddie?  killing off your customers?
this ain't gonna work.
they don't.  they're always asking about you.
then you should go back to your table.
sir, may i go first??
but walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  they didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
why you gotta make everything difficult?
commander... welcome to the protector ii.  would you like to don your uniform?
you dick.
amy! amy, open the door!
didn't think you would.  i'm going to go make the coffin.
there, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
are you gentlemen all through with me?
was there any evidence that mrs. windham shot him?
yes, we sat together at bell's square.
business or pleasure, mr. price?
this afternoon.
it's a short life and a gay one...
perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. mr. o'keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  does that bring back memories of willie o'keefe?
it is as you are.
hide.  run to the ends of the earth till you learn.  you must learn to defend yourself.  in this i can help.
what are the doctors saying?
so can i.
each to his fate, lad.
i'm sorry?
she's dead?
this is the one that looked at dana.
eating solid breakfasts, utah?
attending to heroes?  no sir.  my only regret is that i was never able to be out there with you.
give me the book.
a sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
you know what we ought to do tonight?
we'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
... uh... we seem to be all out of ethel merman.
what is it?
will you be okay?
i thought you...
shabat shalom mama. i brought some manischewitz. the black label.
here, pick these up!
okay, why did i just send my family to atlanta?
...what's the big deal? it's an hour -
caitlin bree. yeah?
watch out, you guys.  beep-beep!
yeah.
just hold-on there --
yeah, i understand, tommy.
my name is calloway.
at least i let you tag along.
you fucked with me for the last time!
the name is gillis.  i'm single.
not one of them today has what you had, miss davies. not one of them.
do you dream?
what do you do?  what are you doing here?
who is he, get his name? i'll kill him.
yessir, that's correct. i know 'em when i see 'em.
we got the sphere but the commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
you wanna bet he's with a girl?
thank you.
the duck?
his wife was killed yesterday.  she was with child.
do i look like i need your money.  it doesn’t work like that and i can’t tell you why.
deadline?
barnes?
don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
yes?  yes?
is that something precious?
the best. but we won't need them.
no!
oh jesus, sheriff, i am sorry. i meant to call you -- i got distracted -- the sumpter girl was not one of speck's victims. that's the good news.
hello?
i seem to be out of gas.
you know what we want.
sorry, jazz.  after this, i'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
oh, jeff, give me a break. you didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
say what?
could i ask you a couple of questions?
what was she like?
so you believed the bartender. why?
you stay out of this!  why, spock? why? i.. all you had to do was pull the trigger.
yeah, i know.  but never to exist again!
dead.
you know, you may think you're gonna get away, but i promise you, everytime you turn around, i'll be there, breathing down your neck.
what are you doing in new york...?
jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? he won't respect me any more.
no.
hello.
win what?
good night, papa.
actually it's a nightmare. i've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. you should try it with tommy.
jimmy, where do you find these people?
i bought it in a pawn shop.
seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
jake --
what are you doing here?
well... kind of, sort of?
napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the directory in paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a roman conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of italy.  only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the directory from replacing him.
toys for adults. where are your toys for adults?
reverse undercover?  we supply to them?
no i probably wouldn't.
sonny...?
shut your ass up and grab the wall!
yeah, well --
oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  so who's this guy?
they're right under the primary heat exchangers.
wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
look.
not here, duff.
does my colleague's piece concern section forty of the bill--a dam on willet creek?
please, rose. i'm curious, that's all, i have a natural curiosity, it's only human. you're my friend, aren't you? don't you like me?  i like you, rose, a lot -- in fact, i love you.
that's right. well, naturally, i didn't say anything to payroll. i assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. but it's been almost three weeks now and i'm still being paid as an ags-18.
-- but you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
let's send his cut back -- just keep going.
he'll play with his rifle, i expect. that will cheer him up.
sir?
if you're not at my place by 7.00, tom and i are running off together.
i'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. that's state time. prison.
how do you know?
just plain old coffee.  none of that mocha nonsense.
she left the fucking gate open.
where were you last night?
every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
you dog!
hundred-fifty.
you know if there's a way i'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  that puts me and the other new york families against you.
well can you connect me to someone else?
alright. then i must never see you again. the bad blood will have to stay there between you and johnny for all time. you won't come to the wedding.
the papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, curtis zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. do you believe that?
save some for tomorrow.
you are young, inexperienced.  you do not know what time can do.  how it can sap all pity, all love.
they like you very much. but they are not the hell your whales.
barely.
i didn't expect you to be so...
well, i have a pretty good idea.
ah, don't worry about i.c.c.  they're the least of your problems right now.
haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
glad to see you're finally with the program.
this could be it.
he won... and they killed robert kennedy.  they shot him down.
thanks.
ernie, they're calling from work.
what is your quest?
hello?  yeah, she is.  just a minute.  for you.
dick burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
i would not have disturbed you, majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
grace skinner.
okay.
do you?
do you think i...
i don't believe so.
people seem to like my cat.
-- what?
what's wrong?
...mmm?
well, not me personally.
frankie feedler. you remember him from high school?
no, no, i want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
you ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated british kisser.
tell me, 007, what do you know about elliot harmsway?
georgina told me how kind you were to her.  it gave me hope you might intercede for us with dr. macfarlane.
otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, i'll dip my beak just a little.  just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
well, it doesn't make sense, nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
now, or he dies, please.
we got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge remington shotgun shells. three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  all of them reloading twice.
he warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against congress.  george, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of america.  listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  george, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
there's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  or even what i want ...
you like spaghetti?
you ever see him sell guns?
i don't know. he was a lame, that's all.
landon. we've lived with this for over a year now and --
but dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
and i'm listening avidly, fellow.
nope.
yeah, well, schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
i can only write on a manual.
i think her father did it. how come they can't find his ass?
it's private.
how did you meet her?
all right... i didn't have lunch with jennifer.
he is.
well, gallagher! glad to see you.
you'll like it fine.
now you better cool out a minute, boy.  you already almost got your head blown to pieces.
hello.
what are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a sunday this year, what can we do?
hey, miles, i heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
mother? 
no thanks.
yes.
what're you, crazy??
guess i made a boo-boo, huh?
look at that.  i haven't watched the sun set in a million years. do you mind?
what about that tattaglias?  what will they do about bruno?
no dead body.  too bad.  not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. exclusive!
"but" what?
don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
yes, of course it is.  you know you have a line here.  not a wrinkle.  actually, more of a dimple.  i've been thinking of incorporating something like that in simone.
harry.
dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
...it's not over, 'til it's over.
now, what are we looking at?  keys.  look at them all.  why do we have them?  mr. president?
ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  i mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. you won't be publishing.  you won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
i don't... think so.
nope. we're safe.
you must be rich.
fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
the only chick more untouchable than christy malone is miss april.  "hi, my name's ginger. i love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." here's a tip:  set it on vibrate, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  don't knock it till you tried it.
he is dead now, twenty years.
maybe there's fingerprints on it?
no!...  we didn't anything...
who are you? who do you work for?
all right, i'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as i can.  and you understand that this is a big secret? just between us?  okay. you know i've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
you hit that ball pretty good, walsh.
was it great?  better than great, it had to be...
you think you've been working hard. this muther'll break your back.
get the hell outta here!
i'll do okay.
holding hands?
so... what happened?
i want to talk to you later.
no, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
you might get hurt.  listen, if you think i'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... i've had these kids all day!
limos, huh?
i saw thum! i saw thum!
the torah says not to light a fire on the sabbath, because it's work, correct?  but if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and i throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
i don't understand.  i thought that you would be happy.
oh god, sailor.
that means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
i don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  you should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
okay. here it is. you gonna go see the doctor. i got nine bucks and twenty more thursday and i gonna be riding high before you know it. so you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
he's not here?
why shouldn't i?
they can't touch us at this height.
hmm,  inform starfleet command. this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector.
how'd you know my daddy?
it's as smooth and slick as oil.
is this my glory, sir?
you look pretty.
turold's son was to marry her.
ellen?
gee, we hate to leave you like this, major kong.  but there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
eughh. sounds horrible.
the twenty-five thousand dollar one.  the one with your name on it.  in bernard barker's florida account.  bernard barker, the watergate burglar--
from other people!  i believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
a man was badly beaten across the street. you know anything about that?
why?
who did you call?
yeh. the big guy used to be a major in the marines.
no, no, we have to get out of here right now.
well i guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
yeah.
suzette will be back here in a minute.
can't you get it, darling?
start acting like you're worthy of this mission... here.  whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
just give it to me!!
i'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found.
ah! ah! ahmenophus!
you look like handmade shit.
you're around every afternoon?
love it!
the last day of the season. yeah, we heard.
seen one billion, seen them all.
let 'em kill each other off! why should we care?
did we go sailing?
what have you been doing here!  <u>huh</u>! <u>i wanna know</u>!  <u>what have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
those boys never did have good luck.
chikuwa, hampen, kobu, konnayaku, ganmodoki --
we are clear and free to navigate.
raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. otherwise this is just another story --
demille is leo.  i'm scorpio. mars has been transmitting jupiter for weeks.  today is the day of greatest conjuction. now turn around.  let me dry you.
do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as ivory snow, absolutely friggin' stupidity of what you just did?
but, father.
easy black boy.
is everything all right?
guess.
i'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  even after i botched the job, i could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
what shit, honey?
are you at leisure holy father, now? or shall i come to you at evening mass?
oh, tom, please.
then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
this is how you're spending my time? having a sock hop?
and i don't get hurt.  i get twenty thousand dollars and i don't get hurt.
what are you doing?
oh, yes, you are. it's been two hundred years since an indian has cocked a snoot at the british empire and got away with it. and stop calling me mr. patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
no, i don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
that boyfriend.  randy.
what?
...that was a dr. david gruber's office...
i wonder if you do. i wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
mama!
direction's east coming!
neither had i.  odd desire for a woman, i guess.
continued
to see?
you wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? get zooted?
you better hurry. the police will be here any second.  i don't really understand my motivation with this. why am i washing glasses?
yes. the scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for.
jack?
nowhere.
rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, rose?
i'll miss you so much.
you fool, you fool.
there was something in your voice on the phone that day.
-- go -- take the van! --
banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  shit, she was part of it!
i'm out.
i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. she must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. i sneaked in and hid till she finished. then i just looked around - and pretty soon i was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so i turned them off - and then i guess, i fell asleep.
... fifty thousand dollars?
dad.
i've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  he's a cop?
which is what?
i wasn't done, i was just sick of hearing him whine. and you didn't take him out, you scalped him. christ, i almost puked, did i tell you that?
i saw him in vegas once.
going for a pony ride at kiddielands, want to come along?
goddamnit--
bill, would you have the torrances' things brought in their apartment.
you should have.
-- posed to mean?
i did live there in the state hospital.
how do you become something you're not?
okay.  what do you do when you don't have a witness?
i'd like you to go wait in the car. how's that?  take her with you and put her in back.
i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but i talked them into letting me walk you out.
do you think she might be interested in  someone?
i'm sorry, neil.  you brought this on yourself.
work.  the things i need to get done.
oh, no.  no.  no.  i meant no scheme.  i merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  it's just a thought.
you are still the best knight in christiandom. you gained a hundred advantages over me. it is i who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
and she's super-nice
but what about me?
this'll do.
okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? what the hell is going on?  you got no discipline in your operation.
that's what we were working on.
you a fine lookin' woman, jackie. i bet you do a damn sight better than okay. you think anybody followed you?
this feels... incestuous.
preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. you want something, charlie?
how do you figure?
i'm hungry.
you're not still writing that thank-you note?
juno? wow, i didn't expect to see you here.
why?
hang up the phone.
what?
don't let it pull you deeper!
come in, mr. juarez. i'd stand, but, well, you know.
simple simon on the rock, go caller.
did you know that whitney houston's debut lp called simply whitney houston had four number-one singles on it? did you know that, christie? whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
oak?
there weren't any voices.
keep watching the news.  are you watching the news?
okay...i think i'll go talk to my son now.  how do i look?
what makes you say that?
nick!... i thought you went home.
i'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. and i'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to mr. haller.
why'd you ask him.
you're sure? this is... just a complete disaster.
big date tonight?
you're good, princess. i'll give you that.
i'm an investment banker. i see blood bathes everyday. besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
you don't go out with girls very much, do you?
i'm sorry --
yes, the first one's fine. heathrow direct.
well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
things are beginning to come to a head.  i can feel it.  and i want everything to be perfect.
i'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
can you open the shuttlebay doors?
look, charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
all right, daddy. we have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
hishradyo.
we just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
yes.
you guys'll be using teddy's old space, is that okay?
yah, well, see, i did that, and i haven't been able to get 'em, so i thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
peculiar?  you mean, like back then?
really?
i was told there was a real nice girl here named joanne. quite young.
no.
are you all right?
military marching bands.
that's it...  herbert macaulay.
the second most powerful man is robert haldeman. just below him are a trio: mr. erlichman is haldeman's friend, and they protect the president from everybody which is why they are referred to as either the german shepherds or the berlin wall. mr. mitchell we've already discussed. mr. colson is the president's special counsel.
write me a note and ain't she sweet. i need a hand and where'd she go.
o.k.
help me get out of here.
dunbar says you were.
i am not a seaman.  but i heard it is no more than a week at sea.  i hope you are not too disappointed.
i got poked around... here and there.
you didn't answer my question.
wrong.  there are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
be careful, dude.
i figured that much. why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
you may not like it, but this is the world we live in, alex.  little grey men with little grey hats.
you're just scared.
yes.
good god.
where did you get the news item?  from a little bird?
epps? you there?
captain, how soon can we land?
the medics are looking all over for you.
it wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
what about me? am i not even here?
toot? it's more like a lost weekend. neither of them showed up for work today.
i want my pills now!
oh, officer starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
so, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
but you never had a chance to prove yourself.
what are you going to do?
i'll relay this to ciiac.
i have no conviction, if that's what you mean. i blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy.
it's a good day.  i feel good.
and you can't tell me who you are.
i'm so dumb! i <u>deserve</u> to die -
i'm never conversational before i coffee.
sorry to trouble you, coco.
no, they were prescription, so i could see all the fishes properly.
call me as soon as you get him.
counting the what? what does that have to do with the price of butter?
what did you say?
it is.
you said that the last time.
oh, charlie.
it's better than springtime.
then where's the money?
i'll just boost the doses.
i did.
it's him...landon.
not to me.
he's a reality television producer. his name is mark weiss.
mister president, i can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  why should they?
i want a word with you ...
i hardly knew the guy. why be impolite to strangers?
great.  who is it...?
with stargher i saw things...
girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
ok. what should i do about eric?
i can make no statement about manchester at this time.
we had one thing figured wrong.  i don't think dudley workd for patchett.
that's between you and yourself, norma.
how do you feel, dejesus?
oh, come on - come on! we'll soon find the wizard!
yo.
well--yeah, i guess--
well, i got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. and, i... i felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  i looked around, and i thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  how can a child grow up here?  so, that night, i told her i didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, i convinced her it was wrong.  i mean... i wore her down, slowly.
thank you.
you have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before i feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
this is dumb, let's find that chick.
saber tooth tiger!
how about it, ma?
birdy... i didn't mean to--
there's a light up ahead.
i'm not that good at 'no,' liza.
so what's in paris?
is that so?
but at the first sign of trouble, i'm going to deactivate it. agreed?
doolittle! help me.
what about one forty-two.
i still have one left...
will you at least let me stay with you?
i have a problem.
it's ten thirty in the morning.
so what's up with you?
we'll be food, dickheads!
did you find her?!
it's not worth goin' over again and again. whatever happened, happened. it's over.
yes.
i guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
thank you, no. i have some work to do... assuming i can still log on.
burkhalter.
hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! understand!
how long ago.
you are a catholic??
see, man. maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. beats cleaning carpets.
you recognize that guy?
it's homicide's job now, ray, let 'em do it.  i'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, ray... if suzie is dead, i think hunter may be on the right track...
and i don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  i know what you're up to.  don't think i don't.  and if anyone tries to get in here -- i've got rope.  i'll hang myself before it gets to me.
what's with her?
we got a problem?
may i listen to the news with you, holiness?
you better quit pushing me, pal.
why don't you lie down until you feel better.
i'm tellin' you now, when i read this, it better not make me look bad.
jesus, jeff.
that's right.
i'm afraid it's true.
here. you'll need one of these.
where will you find such a girl?
hey, pretty woman... sailor here?
bruce, look! dad got some german jam.
have i forgotten something?  is this a special day?
yeah, to play with his dolls.
take it easy, ruby...	it's all right.  now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed doctor layton's throat?
what are we gonna fight? ray, please, listen to me --
you'll thank me eventually, puff. well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
there's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
sybok - this is not the god of sha ka ree - or any other god!
an existentialist.
he don't like popcorn.
suites are for expense accounts. aren't you being extravagant?
who's everyone?
we used to take baths together.
paraffin came up positive. and bullet holes are usually a big clue.
lenore, i'm here.  i'm getting out.
that's a joke, right?
fuchs...?  no, it's not fuchs... you must let me back in... i won't harm anyone... i promise...
there is yet time.  don't you want your own pleasure?
general jack d. ripper, sir.
i can handle the ship.  i can even handle mr. blonde ambition.  but i don't know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits.  who the hell came up with them?
hey!
i don't think so.
i know. listen, we need to take a time out here. can we talk seriously for a minute?
uh-huh.  tell me what you think of this first.
and you get of from school at 3 every day?
it's okay.  how's the dirt business?
yes, i would.
shelly, would you give laura a quick hand with the "meals on wheels"?
do you want me to say i did it?
no.
yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
what i'm not.
nobody ever wants me!
sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
they waved him off. he thought he knew better. he hit the ramp.
i'm the creator.
the rust won't wait for you to read conrad, goodall.
look... i got to know what i stand to win.
she's gonna live.  she didn't steal nothin', she didn't touch his poke.
the duke?  what did you do?
they're impossible!!  jesus!  i mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for tony clifton"??!  who is this tony clifton?!
darling, you can't go through any more of this.  now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
and you defending her?
two.  sherry?... nice joint. you look very pretty.
it was misguided and pointless. is your answer yes?
my job.
why did you tell them my book was being published?
what the hell is wrong with you?
coincidence, yes?  and how is our son?
cochrane?
i've got to stop and help those people.
nobody!
he wants to meet you. he called last night and asked me to set it up. what do i tell him'
mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
that is my daughter.  she say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  i am sorry, mr. jimmy.  i will make it short.
how is she?
your name?
he's a barber.
no, i know what you're going to say. i don't know anything about making a video. but that's a plus.
the lesabre!
construction’s not exactly my line.
that man in my dreams.  he's real isn't he?
why?
well, it wasn't long before what i was afraid was gonna happen, happened. nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in las vegas, and from then on, i couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in vegas, or even near it.
how'd they find out we're going to mexico, thelma, how they know that?
tell me, what's going to happen when we get to venice?
no.
not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  why, man, i have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  who knows how long i may keep you waiting.
charlotte, who?
i know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
i know, mother.
he'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
oh, yes! every day. but i don't need a defense anymore. i embrace! still fighting for the big issues but now in my small, individual way. shall we have a song?
i want some more.
pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get mad bob younger under control!
you actually said that?!  haaaah!!
hmm.  so, del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
how'd i look?
this is so exciting. it's windthorne, her first love, right?
we'll never be the same.
i'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  it may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
as it happens.  i didn't make that part up.
dumper, the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew.
what do you think?
this farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  but when i got misery here, everything changed--she just makes me smile so.
how do you like our little hamlet?
really?
i wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
you'll take care of that.
depends on what you're seeing.
the next one blows off your dick.
we've got to get that valve turned off. their oxygen is almost gone...
daniel, you ought to be in bed.
so?
ah, well done, team 2.
flight's in the morning. you should be on it, too. there's nothing for us here, case. there never was.
nada. vague description, that's all. fine-tooth-combed speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
what, the heat here?
so help me!  all i wanna do is meditate!!
well, i'm going to be working here, mostly at night; i'm a writer. do you have room service?
aramis, this will never --
yeah. i don't know.
i know, sir ...
i understand. christmas -- family and all that --
yeah, yeah, go on.
that's *it*?
ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
cotter'll kill you.
jeffrey mason said it was my idea about the virus.  and suddenly, i wasn't sure.  we talked when i was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. the drugs and stuff.  you think maybe i'm the one who wiped out the human race?  it was my idea?
...a paternity suit, filed 1967...
you leaving that on?
but he couldn't touch me...! we were separated!
what about jackie?
but not tonight.
fromberge...?!  at the front?!  no.
what's the point with hooks and lines? --
bye.
who?
you stop right there. you are a good person. good things happen to good people.
well here's the purse.
you must be wrong, mr. connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the john doe clubs.
right.  so you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
and who is she? does she work in catania?
there's an evil streak in everybody, rose.
nervous?
um, okay. i'll call my study partner.
i am on the track of...
now, gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. you're not having character doubts now, are you?
you could help us.
it's a fait accompli?
a good question.  and a simple answer.  no more hunger.  no more smog. no more overpopulation.  no more war.
you'll get through this. you were fine for over three weeks.
i told you not to bring the other one.
well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
no, i want to keep my room, and get another one.
i made a great reporter out of you, hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. you need me and i need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
well i wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
yes, miss ratched?
god, you two are sensitive. all i'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. why, i'd be proud of that sort of thing.
you know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... it would be nice if you acted like you understood.
did you get this from your lover?
boss!
i'm following you and david, if you-
<u>they</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  i'm gonna go now.
ah, yes, ah yes.  our doctor lechter... and have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  how terrible for you...
sport never treated me bad, honest. never beat me up once.
this attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
hi dad.

come on -- let's get busy. who gets your vote?
they're...they're trying to make us move!
okay. kenny and i only show for the meetings you call us into. impress us. and do it fast.  you're in charge of keeping this quiet. if word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. and it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
oh yes.
that's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  we don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
hi.
hey!  our first phone call!  hello?
five years ago.  november.
jesus christ on the cross... someone make sense.
what if i'm vomiting?
i didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
i believe you sent for me.
a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
thief, i think, is more accurate.
that's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  after the thirtieth. murray and mitch.  after the contest.
yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
art. that's a good subject. you start it off.
i noticed you were having some problems, blue five... i thought i'd help.

did she drown?  the woman you told me about?
i really don't think . . .

di, we're sorry.  we...
no. i didn't used to be bad. no sir. where do you get this stuff? from your mother?
oh -- no. i'm just sort of disturbed about things.
then say you'll spend dollar night at the track with me.
what about me?
it's a suicide note.  says he killed jack because jack had figured out a pornography scam patchett was running.
you keep them.
your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
i know...
i'd like you to look at something, mr. cross.
jail!?  james, you better back off. badge or no badge, i'll kick your ass.
think about what i said.  i mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
is it over?
no. sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
what's wrong with it?
it's a desert.  that's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
yeah.
write this down.  "we gotta play 'em one day at a time."
uh, i don't want to bet it all.
what does snow think you should do?
lovely.
whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
it was a nine millimeter.
love to.
more of price's spook-house bullshit.
no  hell, some secretary in new york just hands it to you. only this one kept dropping it out of the box.

paul, are you there?
... and when i realized our area's just as bad as hinkley, i thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  so i went and asked.
and kat was fully clothed.
well, i suppose i am... actually i knew about the affair.
you're still here?
what is he? tell me! what the hell are we dealing with?
this is good.
yes, monsieur?
then let me go. you don't need me.
...the night batman was born.  what was i doing in the fields that night, alfred? what sent me running out into that storm? i keep dreaming about it but i just can't remember.
no, they want you, mr. president.  i really think it would be a good move.
liane, this is a preliminary...  you didn't tell her we were taping? what did she think she was coming to new york for?
"agent low's theory of suspect zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
it won't sell.
then why have i become a man like you?
are we going to build our little house?
bo. i'm great. listen, i'm expecting some people –-
shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
was i at that dinner?
what?
alright, where is she?
probably not, but i still don't have the nerve to tell him.
she got anything good?
i realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... i wish you'd reconsider.
yes... hi sarris... how are you doing?
allow me, comrade.
wait!  did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... you had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
how'd you get a tux at the last minute?
but i thought... aren't we changing things?  i mean... right now?  changing the way it goes?
dr. lester, it's been really fascinating, but i'm afraid i have to get home to my wife now.
nomak?
maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe.  it could be to humiliate them. just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
sick old women are sharp. come on, i won't disturb...
i'm filing charges against that mother-
you fuckin' worm, if you're going out, i'm going out.
why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  children are very impressionable, you know.

where's your gun?
oh, i was gonna say ...
you're shitting me!
what are they doing?
i'd better go in.
behind me is the soft count room.  we're pretty sure the plates are back there.
got me.  somethin'.  nothin'.  i don't know.
how do you know?  how do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  you're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed klansman in louisiana after us!
i didn't.
no. grammoo said she's in heaven.
i've got so much power to give you, swann.  all you have to do is...beg.
patronizing fuck! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i wouldn't have read it. i knew it was shit. but - idiot! - i believed you!
in all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
it's an appearance. it has nothing to do with support. i don't even like him.
what's so funny?
don't turn on the light.
what about coffins?
come on sheila, knock-knock.
wounded? how?
he's seen both of us now.
i don't think so. it's nice.
but it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
it's always the women that start the trouble.
mrs. porter is not taking her husband's death well.
he's waiting for you.
not if you think like a vegan.
sure i am. what made you turn up, after all these years?
when did it come across?
i never read the paper.
joe koehler.  i know him.  he's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.

someone out there.
when did harp say they'd have the warrant?
is that so? you might marry me?
yeah, it's me.
but how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
wa-shee is like... a dumpling. like tallow we put in stew. i think he was calling you chubby boy.
to wilson.
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had.
why don't you ask the mosebacke?     brazil. until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  today, they don't exist.
did you recognize the voice of the caller?
how'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  get undressed. i want to see you.
it doesn't matter...
salute!!!
that woman could be in any one of four states. four big states where the deer and the antelope play, wesley! we're not in rhode island!
it makes me sad.
commander powell, this is doolittle. ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and i have to ask you something.
and here's one from nice mr. zeiss. he says that...
for no reason, i guess. he always does it. we always run into the house when we see him coming.
the powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  perhaps you've noticed.  perhaps i could help deal you back in.
did you see that?
...i can't remember.
yeah.
ugnh.
it is.  can i have your home phone number with area code?
don't be nervous.  they said you'd be nervous.
i can't believe his mother let him come over here.
this has got to be a mistake.
you know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they’re naked.
you must allow us to act.
twice.
and, we're definitely filling a void in the rural south.
we record and document it. we're gonna make history, dwight. the first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. the book sales alone will be worth millions. i'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. now, what time is orientation?
she's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
check at six minutes.
it's not about the money, x! you never plan for anything. i can't live like that anymore, i need some stability.
how could this be happening?
the possibility alone is worth ten million.  baggage car, rack 3.  silver briefcase.  combination 314.
most every day.
help. no, no-one can help. i just want someone to listen or i will go crazy.
mr. carter, i appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason i am here.
the numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the blue ox. two to minneapolis that night.
now what happens?
i want the money back i've thrown into this rubbish heap.
i mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  you think he's a bank robber, maybe? or a gangster?
- right.  in fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
i'll need the rembrandt now.
why are you doing all this for me?
thank you.  elisabeth, i didn't mean to...
so what do you think?
then why do you want to go?
what was it?  what the fuck was it?
have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, jake?
joey.  yeah, who is this?
couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
the world needs dreamers. to relieve the pain of consciousness.
why? there'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
another time, okay dorothy?
because life is good.
can you tell us what's on the disc?
we've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
sire!  i -- how did you --
it's about the three musketeers.
that must have been when he got it.
you want me to put it all in writing? over my signature?
federal express?
will they free me?
thank you.
they said they were goin' to the twin cities?
mother and dr. darling have me under observation. they think i tried to kill you.
yeah, i think we do. we could try to cut each other up. but that would be bad for everybody. bad for me, bad for you. and worst of all, be bad for eddie.
for food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. dear lord, thank you.
waiter, oh waiter! wait a minute!  we are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- i see the baroness is laughing.
i want to see-- 
promise me you will never leave me.
no big deal.  we just got off on the wrong foot.  what's your name?
easy there.
i really thought we had something special going. i can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
this ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
shaky?
why?
you know.
gee, i'm busy. did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
he's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  he's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  that's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  did she call him back?
we know each other?
aye-gor!
oh no!--i just remembered.
why didn't you get into bed?
whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
he did know.
no shit.
but we need to start off with a bang! something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  mmm.  what was your biggest hit?
i don't know where he is.
yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
that's your problem, george bailey.
i know what a "witness" is.
you think that?
how'd they --
m'mmm.
i think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. i think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
but... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
sorry, dick.  she's a little tipsy.
so, what are you doing now?
she has the best palate of any woman i've ever known. she could even differentiate italian wines.
but...
-- it's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, viktor.  if you can't handle her, i will.
i lowered the drinking age to ten.
no.
who did that? what the fuck is that?
it's in all the afternoon papers. i'm very sorry.
what a strange fellow.
hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- nice dog -- well, i'll see ya later.
good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
how about dangerous curves?
how do you play reality.
...and my lover. he was harry.
monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain.  he said you were practicing deep meditation.
well, it's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. in the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. it's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
you don't seem all that proud.
i think i've got something to say.
i worked for him... still do.  said he'd make sure i was left alone if i helped put wade away.  he kept his promise for twenty years.
but he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
no, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
no!
it was... it was.
jake.  you're gonna be all right, jake. you're gonna be fine.
you know...like restaurants, night clubs...
oh, no, my young jedi. you will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
nobody's using it. silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty samsonite shit.
well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
shit, shit, shit, shit. my car's gone!
keep your voice down.
well...  i'll tell you.  one day about a month ago...
my mother...?  i never knew my real mother - i was adopted
poor dumb suzie, she never had a chance.
jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
could you get here without any trouble?
it means i'm through with boxing. i'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. i'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
no! you cannot know that!
oh, putting on the swell, eh?
i'll tell them fuzzy was adopted.
you need anything else?
permission to come aboard.
as a matter of fact, we sent a man to the silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  our man even arrived before the "chronicle" reporter.  and there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
but dad --
no.  the girl.
no, no, no. you were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. it won't do. it's stupid and boring.
but it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. you shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
bad and illegal behavior. that's what i mean. ok?  mischief.  now have you been doin' some drugs today?
you followed him?
what?
no. here is a pattern. two days ago freddie miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november 7th. we look at hotel records and we see oh! dickie greenleaf is staying in san remo and then our boatman remembers two americans taking a boat.
thank you, hank. we're on it. what were you doing out at sidney's tonight?
yes you're wrong.  this isn't a fucking game, walter--
don't tell me, john.
i... yes.
new life defeats death?  follow the signs?  where the hell did you find that guy?
all right, miss juspeczyk.  pack your things.
oh yeah?
okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
and this is helen carter.
that's not bad. how about a float of george washington crossing the delaware?
what are you doing?
how can a man do this loomis? tell me.
that's very thoughtful.
it was an accident.
my name goes on that report.  it's a half-assed job, i don't get my doctorate.  neither do you....
no, sir!
why were you afraid?
it was time for that a couple days ago.
poor mickey -- when i think of him all by himself in that jail in havana --  -- want to see his picture?
adrian!  don't leave so soon.  i --
yes sir, i'll look into that.  would you like to meet him sir?
isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? is she a four alarm fire, or what?
actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
you just got a mickey.
i'm fine, kimmy. fine.
you've always hated my taste in the past.
i don't even know what i'm looking for!
i don't need you to get the money -- my money!
making sure nobody's following us.
you mean to take us all down with you?
you think it's simple, huh?
but happy. very happy, peggy sue.
what is she gonna do here?
well, yes your nose is. very.
asshole!!
maybe later, but first i want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
gort?  but he's a robot. i mean -- without you, what could he do?
and no more demons. i told you they'd be gone.
to be a mother?
how many times do i have to tell you-- i have a system here.  where the hell is that thing?
me-ow.
no, sir, i can't.  not beyond a reasonable doubt.
i need to find my daughter.  i'll pay you.
jerk... what did you say?
kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
again?
i'll take that as a no.
yeah, i could too.  but... i don't know why i'm even asking you this. it's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. i don't know.  i keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  if just one person would say...
just so.  granted.  and so you take your experimentations to sleepy hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  bring him here to face our good justice. will you do this for me?
but how are you finding new orleans, senor farragut?
all right, since i got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
pterodactyl!
apocalypse, end of the world, armageddon. its always got a face and a name.
are you all right?
i was here six years.  and i only hated two.
-- no. no offense to the old man. i appreciate you trying to help. but i put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
maybe it's just a food baby. did you have a big lunch?
i never said... oh look. that's just a figure of speech. she said something funny, and i said...
you don't know it was an accident. you only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
they learned.  they cut the power and avoided the guns.  they must have found another way in, something we missed.
yeah...
i've got just the place for a man like you but i'm too busy right now to do any digging.  what do you call your dog when you want him?
excuse us a minute?
d.w.p. thanks for holding. how can i help you?
my love... because i love you.
you'll get your money. don't talk to any newspapers about this. twombley's a big deal down in massachusetts, you know. tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
mrs. robinson -- i can't do this.
you tagging them...?
that stalker ted got to you, right? you're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
i know, no--  i know.
'atsa sign i got me an affectionate nature.
it's okay.
end of the line.
same, more of the same. yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. then, instead of watching gilligan, we'd watch captain kirk.
well, mr. gardiner, that's just fine with me - i'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... be seated, please, mr. gardiner...
what was that all about?
it's almost lunchtime. are you hungry!?
they're not home yet.
not because of me, i hope.
what are ya tellin' me, charlie?
you got it.
why?
we... three bullets.
no, bigger!  what's the biggest energy??
scottie!
rucker.
if i want to be one with them, i have to live like them.
what's going on....what are you doing?
no, wait -- apples.  apples.
c'mon, hurry up. we're never gonna get outa here tonight.
mr. freeze.
i'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
how long?
we cannot go into this later.
not that i could see.
but it's not a great syllable
but you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. i'm not allowed.
may we have the rings please?
don't see how. i think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. no, trust me -- disaster pics. and air hockey.
oh my god...we’re buried alive...
how'd ya do?
you're not listening to me.
it's okay. she was supposed to pick me up.
please forgive me. because i like you. i don't think of you that way. but i'm mixed up.
rob here.
this is all very pleasant but why are here?
blasphemy be damned! waldman spent his life trying to help people!
have you ever smelled burning flesh? i smelt it four miles away. four miles away, i smelt it. have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? you talk to me about culture, art and music? you putting that in the scales, wilhelm? you setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? they had orchestras in the camps. they played beethoven, wagner. the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. i don't understand the germans' relationship with music. what do you need music for? your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated? yes, i blame you for not getting hanged, i blame you for your cowardice. you strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and i say to you, lies!
yeah. ya see, i ordered that special.
if i change my mind.
continue the joke.
the kitchen.
hi, whatcha doing?
what's your name?
josie you owe it to yourself to go. for your writing. you're a natural.
have you ever known anybody a long time?
or maybe you just think you do.  you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
well--nobody calls you anything but saunders.
no really, i can stay a while.
will he be supervised?
it's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, tim.  one, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
oh, what?  i offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
why the hell you wanna go up to nu mung ba for?
the reaction has proceeded too far. the core has begun to melt.  engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
doc it's janet.
ah.  yes, of course ... um ... err ...
do you want to pick me up?
so what...?  the best is yet to come.  check the tv guide.  they got our dr. towler on a panel on gbh on friday: 'the healing hand. the experts speak.'
it's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, delly.
i'll be honest with you bud. i'm getting sorta concerned about what i'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
lost sen!  he'll never find us.
grandmama said how sailor murdered a man.
i... i like you.  a lot.
crabtree? he doesn't even know james.
hi dad.
what does it look like?
we don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
morphine? chloroform? horse tranquilizers? you've drugged him!
not <u>any</u> car. i like to keep a variety. i'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. i liked it.
i need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
what?
seriously?  what did they say?
man i'll try about anything; but i'd never touch a pineal gland.
that's what i said.
that was really great.
jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
yes.
want me to drive?
whose blood you got all over you?
i... uh... i don't know. i guess don't like to think about it.
'the italian stallion' -- he's my man.
so juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
why?
it seems like we're getting lower.
yeah, both of us.
your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
i won't, mom.
excuse me?
no, i really think i do.
you haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
you sure?
well, annie, your place or mine?
i am trying to keep emotions out of this. even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject.
what about us?  are we to wait forever?  is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star? part of my reward is that i be around to spend it.
you have not been fully trained. but you will learn.  and you will be good, i can feel that.  you have apt- itude.  this is why our friend is so concerned.
i don't know.
... uh, i hope this doesn't embarrass you.
i'll do anything... face any challenge!
what's your name?
so they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
why not?  don't you think you could be?
i'm sorry. that's the wrong answer.
who do?
you mean i'm black?
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
if you say a word in english, vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you, and that's a price i'm not willing to pay.
there's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. food's shot to hell.
assistant.  and don't call me jazz.
well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and i guess he was right.
carter?
no "buts".  if he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  hello?  yes, the subs -- i want a report...  hello...  yes, a report. gimme... shit.
it's the chancellor.
but i'm not through complaining yet.
we're throwing him a last supper. we came to invite you.
you know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, i was actually on my way to you. i bring the most amazing news.  the high lama wishes to see you, mr. conway.
don't bother.
pat, this is my cousin vanden and her boyfriend stash. he's an artist.
sometimes.  and sometimes i don't--  shut the fuck up!
my agent.  i called my agent.
how am i supposed to know that?
i'm out of here.  jenny.
aaagh!
proceed.
mm-hm.
geiger counter?
there was this kid there saying, "go in there and save my father, mister." and i'm thinking about my boy joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. it was like i was supposed to save myself.
no, don't make trouble.  it's nothing.
this is great, honey.  the orange. has it got a little vodka in it? like that finnish stuff, orange vodka --  put your lips around this one, bill. it's out of this world.
what?
fucking.
damnit, i hate this!  i'm a cat burglar!  nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
i'm not goin' home tonight... i'm goin' somewhere else...  to a girlfriend's house.  but, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
--nobody gives a shit about the dahlberg repercussions--
are you still working security for foster & langley?
and the father replies?
i <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
what about me, reverend mother?  i think you were right.  i'm just a bad influence.  sister show biz.
how did they execute him?
you've made me a happy insurance person.
oh, get it over with.
i wouldn't know anything about that.
totally. the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven.
see, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, nicky- boy.
...i mean, doc, the dude is seriously deluded. i said that to him, i said, "if you think i'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
you weren't gonna say goodbye?
why?
i can't fucking believe you!!
please...
you got to investigate. no question about it.
that's the dope.
vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, yakavetta's right hand. he's the one who set me up. then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone i was as good as dead. he goes in there every wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. never misses.
who is that girl, anyway?
hurricane hormone. it's flattened the whole school. guess what?
you want me to move the television set in here?  you play gin rummy?
well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
are you ready ilsa?
not just every six weeks.
oh, i'll be there all right.  i'm not letting you out of my sight. not till you're ready.
did you see that?
this is good work, x, damn fine work. you need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "ahab".
hey joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
what name?
diet coke.
five years of it. surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
a parka.
waxy wright.  didn't jon archer bust you for poisoning five members of the canadian parliament?
tony clifton.
if you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
i might wake up.
you know of it?
there's one thing i may as well tell you. you'll find it out anyhow. i tried to run away--when i found him out there on the balcony. there wasn't any plane.
i read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
you can bring mr. dennings if you like.
the mantan manifesto.  catchy ain't it?  number one.  we gainfully employ african americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  two. let the audience decide.  three. who put these critics in charge? these so-called cultural police? four.  who determines what is black? five.  mantan is a satire.  six. if they can't take a joke, "f" 'em.
okay... on what?
no.
no, you've done a perfect job.
easy, mon.
yeah, i think so.
let me get the light.
your fair smile be thanks enough. better i stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
shhhhhhh!
greg.
"little latin lupe lu."
you ever been to london?
and it's been blue skies all day. it might be perfect all weekend.
pretty.
boo.
they're not supposed to be here!
helping people makes me happy.
come on, sid. give me the gun.
i'm afraid that drink will have to wait, captain.
kevin, it was just a --
you're not going anywhere.
yeah?
it's a puzzle box.  if you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
and because he's my friend.
just a formality.
oh, but there is-
i'll be frank with you.  this was his mother's idea.  a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
i can't help my heart. and when i'm your dad, you'll have to do as i say.
why not?
so whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at piping? meet the membership? i got a little blonde named mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
awww, he's so cute. what's his name?
i can see that.
hi, john.
you two don't even know how crazy you are.  you want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
you're gonna offer to set him up?
you been okay?
okay, i'm on channel two.
what?
there's no blood.  where's the fuckin' blood?
i'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  you have not for- gotten madame's new year's party.
...he's a good man...
i'm mad at you.
there are things i have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. but they can wait. the only important thing now is that i love you and i'm going to keep you safe.
you mean you're not coming back to work here?
it's not unthinkable.
hardly. you have six bedrooms
yes?
what is this?
happy birthday.
eating?
like...?
that's not much time. i'll just slow you down. i have to sleep. i'm very tired. and i have to wash and eat. you don't...
what kind of words?
don't get near 'em.  the plants! they're alive.  those things can imitate anything...
back when i was your age i always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. i think you're gonna need one tonight.
it can't be.  it's impossible.
i know alexander.  his imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at friedland.
you moved any slower, you'd grow roots...we've got a schedule...shake it, man....
you've never seen "the odd couple?"  this is sick.  "the honeymooners?!"
the only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. when they start raving on and on...
what's that?
why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. i'm running out of lies, trevor.
what is it?
nurses.
yes, i thought so.
it's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  dr. marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...ms.nevins...
i understand.  pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
oh, come on, amado--
beaumont worked for you.
why ain't his pick swinging?
what's all this for?
heard of harry lime?
we waited for you... hours, jim. you could have telephoned, for god's sake.  it's easter!  you promised, jim.
the previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
merde... wait here. when i return you tell me about last night, huh?
san francisco's a long way from here.
long live the fighters!
up and down, up and down!
so you weren't interested in music at all?
you're not helping.
vomit?
sfpd?  castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
i don't know what you're talking about, man.  even if i did, i'm not so crazy i'm gonna cross zimmermann.
die, dickweeds!
okay. see you later.
aft thrusters -
oh! italian, right?
...they sound what?
hello wade.
leo strauss...  i've got to go to boston. i came to say goodbye.
you've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
did i what?
all right, how's the new partner?
just to walk with you.  i want to be your dad again.
this is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but i'm not going to. i'm too mad-
today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
not unless you call me rick.
i didn't curse. i said 'frickin' head'.
why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
to your family.
something maybe big.
but it's...
a bird of prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
you mean you had a bad dream.
how well my comfort is revived by this.
that's entrapment.
what do you see here?
we could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
yes. yes, someone's got to feed them.
have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
what do you mean?
i won't leave you like this.
seems like it's going well.
well, i certainly... i think that's very- yeah, yeah...  yeah. do you love me?
you've been so quiet lately, petra, i thought you no longer cared.
so, you just got out?
i thank you.
i have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
i know where it's going to be.
diego delgado, please?
have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, miss cartwright?
yeah.
can i just ask you one other thing?
you got no idee.  people there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. nothing the same.  in my countlee i bling good luck.  makee lain and thunder.
you'll probably have them the rest of your life.
cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
we're makin' moves on each other.
sounds like you, hicks.
well...
-- like she's gonna kill me.
any school you want.
goodbye, dr. lecktor. you can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
alderman swayzak.
but you can't...
very pretty. very pretty, indeed, miss mitchell. but would you mind telling me who goes on christmas eve?
so let me get this right. you were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the titanic?  that's great!
why not?
you gotta stop calling los angeles .. you're dragging l.a. around with you like an addiction.  look at the shit you're putting yourself through? for what? for <u>nothing</u>, i know it, i been there. remember me? up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  if there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. let somebody else worry about it. you gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
yeah, true.  but what does your father exactly do for living?
doc!!!  so listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
all they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
it's nothing. a stupid party. not really a night club, it's, uh...
this way.
he's stubborn as a stone.
how's it working, scotty?
yes, general kutusov, i daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  napoleon would simply spend the winter in moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  another lesser possibility might be to march on st. petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
no.
who else phoned?
you mean like in the steam room?
no - the ukulele.  and i sing.
yeah?  well, in that case, have a drink.
is she?
you don't need to lose any weight. you're kidding, right? you look great. very fit.
well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why i thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, louis?
is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
jump, timmy!  it's too late!
... orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  you see it over the rocks there?  sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... are you listening to me, alex?
don't shit a shitter.  our building. what did you call it?  his 'tomb'?  we had an agreement.  you were supposed to sit on it.  not sell it --
congratulations.
i won't tell mom if you don't.
i do.  it's little shit like that sends people to jail! we have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
i'm afraid you have no alternative. in such, a case the planet earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
she's one of the sick people?
oh, la.
we're recruiting.
yes. what do they... stand for?
yes.
aren't you getting a little old for this?  you flunked out of law school.
what am i going to say to bruce? what'll i tell him?
we want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
yeah.
just one daughter.
so the shit you gotta go through? to get from here to there?  brother said it was worth it.  worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
you sure?  you look pretty shaky...
why not?
that food has spoiled.  that is why it was not shipped to the army.
okay.. .we're done, man....
mornin', ladies.
read you're a man of some knowledge.
we're screwed.
what did you put on it?
that fucking larry.  i almost believed him.
terry left his passport in curacao. we could hide him...
it is your corrupt we claim.
so, you see how silly that rumor is?
yeah - josephine.
keymaster?
they won't do anything to junior, darling.  anonymous letter writers -   i've got guards in front of the house, and i'm going to arrange -
humor me.  eat it anyway.
he left!  i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
marvin says that rex's will is four years old. he never redrafted it.
i can't, it's yours.
mm hmm.
save that for the tribune.
but you’ll never get away with it.
they're keeping an eye on me.
what? no! do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
hell.  this is just like fucking star wars, man!
what's your names?
well, that was money well spent.
genius!  --  lex.
we're going to aunt cecile's, honey. we're going to watch fireworks from there.  let's go.  chop chop.
yeah. i'm gonna get my... i'm gonna get my camera.
for what?
so what's your story, nick?
getting late.  we better get back.
gloria -- may i call you gloria?
you paid for my flowers?  they're beautiful.  max, you gonna introduce us?
danny... what's the matter, hon?
i object to the form of that question.  note that.
30   continued:
no, he would've loved it!  bela's returned from the grave -- like dracula.  cue vampira!
all right. put it in the room where we were.
round about, yeah.
everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
thank you, ma'am...
you don't want to know.
nothing! that's absurd. i heard you laughing and talking, she was asking questions.
just a few tokens of my affection. i'll be back soon, don't worry.
a thousand things.
about him?
sure have.
and you said there'd be some of me left.  nobody's going to know me in this getup.
you parked right behind him.  the one i noticed earlier.  i didn't say anything, i thought he'd leave. just take a look.
you think i stink, don't you? you think i stink for what i told you?
that is a trifle strong.
what's up?
it must be one of these...
shit! you just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. i knew this was a scam. i shouldn'ta come.
why'd you come here, brian?
says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
pat's an architect, too.
miami?
this is a great song.
i... i... think i'm... shot.
well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but i'm sure it's over by now. he should be checking in any moment --
if you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, i'd probably be pissed.  boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
can't think. he's dead. in ireland. he was a soldier. went there like a fool.
however they are, that's the deal. a buck a throw.  five thousand dollars.  split it half and half.
look, it's a fairly straightforward question. you're either divorced or you're not.
let her go.
goodbye.
well, uh, there's this benefit for rwanda we're gonna do. and, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where i get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
hmm!
i don't know why you boys are so good to me.
good. more coffee?  robert, i hope you don't mind my asking, but i feel like i should.
... i asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  if you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
we must go to the diplomat.
jesse, is that your hand?
say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
that sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, i guess it's okay.
i saw them kill him!
i'm not even wearing any drawers. forget about a belt.
i don't follow music much. i'd like to though.  honest.
in that case, there's someone here i'd like to introduce to you. over there.
you sure? maybe next week we could...
i've seen him.
morgue...?
do you?
i said you can be too crude sometimes? i don't think i care for it.
i'm sam helburn. sam.
sally, for christ's sake.
anything.
well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  no question about that.
his nervous breakdown followed hobbs. could he kill again if he had to save his life? or would he hesitate?
no gentleman would do that.
i'm sure they are. but what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
peter peel was a first class agent. a senior operative. 'x' department special operations. he was engaged in top secret research. top priority.  government approved.
it fizzled, baby. that's the way it goes. but we had our times, didn't we? it wasn't all bad.
where you going?
can't i touch it a little, rose -- not a lot, just a little?
if you're going to have a barney i'll hold your coats.
... in the garden?
can we eat him, uncle birdie?
okay.  is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  some memory or...
oh god, it's that bloody yank!
you should be.
and thus unable to declare her love
get what?
so, not married.  well, good for you.  you play the field, like me. a girl in every port, huh?
i'm sure you're very proud of max.
crash override. what was it. "mess with the best, die like the rest?"
you have proven that already, comrade skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
which is guy-speak for...
are you sure?
listen, i'm crazy about the guy -- he's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry parrish communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
why the hell not?
what the hell's going on here?
i think that we should stop going out on dates.
are you clean?
oh, god
tell your friend i'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. we'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  and make sure i can get to that window this time.
i would have figured you an r.n. by now, or, maybe med school.
now wait a minute. aren't you being a little unreasonable?
doctor, this is da mayor talkin'.
thank god this is america.
no. i got it in prison. i went in for three years. when i came out she was married to my best friend. happy?
pity.
that slut!
what time's diner tonight?
how much time?
exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... that's what the public expect from a carl denham picture! lead us into the mountains, sir!
well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
did you masturbate?
leave? the honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
think zimmermann's watching?
how long has my father been like this?
he got my gun!  motherfucker was filming the whole time!
put the key in and turn it.  the right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die, she's the only one.
whenever he played radio city, who do you think was right there in the front row?
veronica. what are you doing tonight?
with what?
i hope you like large weddings.
i see. then what brought you up here?
i sense the fumes of opium in all this. perhaps miss scott picked up the habit in shanghai.
i command you.
jim?
i'm not saying nothing to you.
i can still taste you.
virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
nice tie, lt. anus, sir.
listen, keep away from me, hear? you come near me again, i snatch you bald-headed!
never been better. peter spent the night. i must really love him. he's still alive.
are you crazy?
well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  i said oswald must've flipped.  just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
we were planning to be married right after christmas.
good luck, sir.
such a beautiful view.
you disapprove of me when i'm like this, don't you?
yeah, for some reason, i'm sure...
the tower, yes -- flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
dr. monnitoff?
do you want a drink?
andre zhdanov?  how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov?
edie.
i guess it's a combination you don't often see. apparent attraction..
what's the matter?
yeah. this is an island, you know? takes too long to get into the city. we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
what exactly did they say?
i want you to take me to another motel.
the omega 13... why does that sound so familiar?...
bodhi, yeah.  i'm on him all day, right.  he goes here, he goes there, he goes to tower records and buys come cds, he has lunch at patrick's road house...  ... he goes into the assured trust savings and loan.
what's with the plastic picnic ware? why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
john.  my name is john.
hello, junior. what are you? some kind of half-assed astronaut?  jesus christ, when i was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. what d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
what else is there?
just like i always promised.  now you're among the immortals.  you're movie stars.
hello?
but here's the funniest part of it all. i was the fella up there doing the marrying. you know, the justice of the peace or something . . .
er... well... we... we... would be terribly grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
what?
i work in the da's office. you go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
you asleep?
gee, i haven't done this in years.
is that the only reason you came back?
yeah.  retirement?  paid sick leave?
what you look at, indy?
will it work?
he agreed that he was.
no.  i was alone.  my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
of all the times! of all the times! two months to the end of his term-- and foley has to go and die on us--
must be thousands of them. what are they doing?
sure.  in between all the other things i have to do.
look, young man, the issue is simple. if you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
i thought we were goin' to a movie.
we don't have any proof of that.
to the fleet.
i'm engaged.
yes.  it's regrettable
how're you holding up?
when?
oh, he ain't nobody.
uncle, how are you feeling?
maybe i'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, sefelt.
where is that sun?! it has gone behind the hill.  it is dark and cold. it has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the european masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  and le subtil is the son of his tribe. there have been many clouds and many mountains. but now he has come to lead his nation.
forgive you? i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
what's the hurry?
look at foley! can you believe it!
it's mine to give. i didn't steal it.
- even though leonard's always asking you to go out with him and i - just -
well, what about books?  you like hemingway?  you gotta love hemingway.
it was blown up with the plane.
but that wasn't me.    i didn't mean to do that.
they caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. they found the bird. his head crushed in. when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  they think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
so much has happened lately -- has it changed your life style much?
just a minute--your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
and how's cecilia? she's a great girl.
quite a night, inspector.  ricky tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  you finally got your revenge - at the expense of a u.s. government investigation.
what were _you_ looking for?
i wanna go...just let me go...
otis payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
nothing.
business hours are over, sir. this is the switch...
it's safe, come on.
edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. you're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
mike's gotta go.  nice to meet you.
did you like my friend frankie?
we're not going to get a ride tonight.
just get on with it, alex.
c'mon, man. the water's fine. nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. this place is closed up. electricity's off.
my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
yeah, right.
"soon". or at least sooner than never.
is this anthony?...yeah, well, i just have one question for you, anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
tomorrow i go with vince.
what's that look like to you, rico ?
yes, it is.
eh... yes.
what could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
erica.
well, you've got it. and there's no losing it. and there's no one to blame. so why quit?
but i'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. he knew all the fuckin' angles. he brought over the whole 'femme fatale' show from paris. but he forgot how lazy them european dancin' broads can get. i mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
you shoot like a girl.
cal...
no response.  i'm not reading any starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
this is sourpuss. er, excuse me. er, mr. smithers, mr. doe.
his "veracity" was good enough for the state of mississippi.
what...?  0h, yes.
all right. truth. i believe that one. why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
well, since i'm not only your father, i'm also your friend; i had to get you two presents.
you're insane.
how come you have to tell them that?
what happened?
we're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. ed, i have some news for you. we're picking up ed tv for another month!
really!
oh, i realized right away. he's really a very nice fellow, hildy -- i found that out.
impossible? why?
i can take care of myself.  you know that.
easy, easy, easy, shhh!
don't shoot yourself.
happy? why shouldn't i be happy? i'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  here you are, king. let's drink.  let's drink to us .  we finally made it, didn't we?
yes you did. last night. to your friend crabtree. "is he any good?" he said. and you said: "not yet he isn't." i heard you myself.
i'd seen him in a coffin so many times, i expected him to jump out...
hmph!  they sure didn't give andy much to do.
okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. maybe i can use him to help with --
who are they?
you were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. i want to use a bomb.
yeah, you know it? you know billingsley's?
were you pleased with his work?
there are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long i've worked for the mob. the <u>mob</u>, bobby!
oh.  oh yes.
yeah.
i thought it would make more sense. i'm getting the pieces, but when i put it together it feels like... like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
you must shut down the engines.
i know, son.  but you'll like it where we're going.  i'm getting a good job.  it's a pretty part of the country.
and i couldn't follow her.  god knows i tried.  one doesn't often get a second chance. i want to stop being haunted. you're my second chances, judy.
hey you!!
we should stick together out there.
a girl of spirit.
open your eyes, mr. lounds.
from my perspective, what's been going on and what i've been doing is ridiculous. it's half-measures.
oh. you have to tell me that.
j, what's going on out there?  get the rifle out, charles. we're being fucked.
what are you worried about?  this job is going to last a long time.
no.
yeah? that's good. sorry is good. you know i finished that model.
how?
under a cloud without cause, i take it.
i wanted to let his family know....
interesting.  mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
next thing i know i'm on rikers island. ever been there?  suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. they tell me if i'll come to vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. well, i'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam couldn't be any worse.
melanie...
i don't know.
you see a ricky slade?
used?
report.
jesus, mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
i hope you understand.
wow. anyway, i think it's amazing you're getting it published. really. i know how hard it is. just to write it even.
oh, i'm already swooning.
well, what do you think?
batman.  the thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
we've got a lot of work to do.
before you are.
hey andy, good show.
dead?
"what do we tell him about the guns and money?"
toby tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and i'm gonna have his love child.
and this makes you "sad"?
i didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  i wasn't bad. i thought i was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
i've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. we should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
it's more or less how it sounds. sometimes it's not pretty to watch. some horses fight it real hard. your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. so if you don't want to watch, i'll call you when it's done.
you'll get awful mad, john. i done a sin!
and you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
what's mine is mine.
what's going on here?
i have to tell you.  it's strange.
this is just the first shot. maestro. sooner or later she's gonna use the word. and all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the jews.
well, i've been trusting you all this time, haven't i? we agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
we'd gone to 'code blue,' we were administering electro...
that's right.
i'd rather be with him than without him. i don't want to be found dead in l.a.
i don't remember in detail, there were so many.
just call me spidey.
they may have attacked only as a warning to us, captain. to keep away.
a cheap hotel.
oh, god!  do you hear a buzzing?  is there a buzzing?
very nice. unless it caved in, too.
oh.
i should go get some of her things.
look, you're only sort of insane, really. people like you can lead semi-normal lives. you could get a job...
i don't know. stanzi? stanzi!
the letter i sent.
you know how to write one of these?
this is not going well.
occupied france?
actually, it's mary brooks now.
oh.  you must have been, uh, very unhappy.
what was my mission?  to help my country?  but how could i do that? i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
now tell me, why would i want to do that?
yes. he said... "do not try to make them understand you."
and they tell me i'm paranoid.
and?
that's not funny.
what do you want? it - it's pitch- black out here. it's tin foil.
no.
this one.
it's the other way around. the society sent me through med school.
you don't remember me.
here's your carrots. you're in such a hurry. you can't wait.
good.  'cause i'm enjoying myself.
what the hell did this?
i am?
have a good sleep.
sir. it's quite clear that...
oh, yes, sir. very much. and i want to thank you --
you set?  sarge nods.
the club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  i want to try someplace different.
excelsior? why in god's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus, new jersey.  a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  i don't know where you come from, ms. grey, but where i come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  you do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  but what you presume to tell this committee -
quod nomen mihi est?
we'll be half-way down the road with the money.
what for?
hey, you can't...
hey! we're gettin' married--!
could we go somewhere?
oh.  well.  we don't really get along. paul and i.
hello, colonel! want a lift?
...you're ed crane?
this is healing?
great! go back to your files. bye.
baby-sitting.  rookie cop.
how far away is she?
but i insist.
wait.  you're not wearing that ironically?  this is really you?
that would knock my father out.
don't ever do that to me again.
i wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, jean-luc picard. in my experience, it's unusual for...
you don't have to talk about it.
he don't believe in it.
and the wine - excellent.
no, he <u>works</u> too much.  he's chained to his desk. too much detail. now, if you could take over some of his work--
ya back is got.
how do you do, mrs. mulwray?
where are you,...al?
i mean let's face it, mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- i'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
shoulda learned with web. made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. got web killed. now jim.
...i'm rachel abundas. everyone calls me birdy.
lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
i'm not a thief.
he said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  her name's anna. but she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
you wouldn't like it.  i've been there.
she just died, your mother just died?
fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck frank sinatra, too.
is it safe for them here?
what can you say?
unnt-meah!
it's a movado.
neil... neil cole.
say, 'nigger, fuck me hard!'
what's on your mind?
doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in california like we think?
i'm looking for them.
flies the plane....
i think it would be better for me to go alone.  i'm sure sim is looking for you.  just sit tight.  i'll bring you back a pizza.
make a list.
every successor will owe his loyalty to us. together we take out maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
catch it later, pham.  gotta get over to nestor's.
ok, whatever you think... i'm lost.
spare met jack. i'm into legit investments from here on in.
you're right. i know.
pictures?
in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch. does that sound alright, mr. creasy?
big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  all old files are sent up to the castle.  do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
no what?
i'm dyin'. i'm dyin'!
you could start over again with cash like that.
so he says, 'so i get it, so you think i'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
that ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
but what is this?
no.
you...
well, try, huh.
who came in after you?
yeah?
sure. it complies with all standard construction codes.
let's get ahold a' her quick.
you don't know?  she left thirty minutes ago.
no really, if god takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
you're doing fine, ich.  now drop it, okay?
and a social life.
... back up those stairs - damn... that man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
time is running out, dana.  soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and vigo's.  well, mainly vigo's.  but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
the new antiquities exhibit.  the second sun of the sudan.
he doesn't like to say much does he?
you always go with andy.
and don't limit poetry to the word. poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  it can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  by all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, i don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
wait!  professor...?
i just wanted to share an apartment. what was so complicated about that?
well, there's fishing and boating. there's concerts on the mainland and... but i feel silly telling you. this is really your home. you probably know better than i what there is to do.
what's that mean?
this is damned peculiar.  yellow alert.
he wants to marry me, doesn't he?
see you tomorrow, miss boatwright.
i'm not scared.
with who?
stifler!!
i'm forty-three years old. i don't want to wait. i know you well enough to know that i really love you very much.  and i can't think of anybody better to be with. and i don't feel like waiting anymore.
god protect me.
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
livid is good.  so what is it, maggie? you here on business?  i saw your lamps. they're terrific.
you... you're a beast!
of course, i've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
for that matter, you were wrong about me, too. what you said about those who take and those who get took? well, mr. sheldrake wasn't using me -- i was using him. see?  last month i was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now i'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
i don't know.
they give you copies to burn.
fine.  i was making time with your girl.  now i'm all scared, and i'll never make that mistake again.  now go away.
how do you feel, agent
--it's less than four feet, just--
gone with daniel webster -- to marshfield, son.... you told mary to go--
what?
you...you dirty bird. she can't be dead. misery chastain cannot be dead! how could you?
you don't know that.  it could be a trick.
i'll say. you killed his goddam girlfriend instead. now they're onto neski. they're at the brecker hotel even as we speak.
sail?
well, you have to expect some static. computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
certainly the most beautiful crook i've ever seen.
elliot.
is it you?  if i said moose… i look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
not unusual.
and this is stacy.
go, join them.
man, telly, your little brother is getting big.
blasphemy.
why, malcolm?
i'm afraid so. if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans... earth will remain in the second dark age... an easy target when the borg arrive in the 24th century.
listen to me son. you got to swear. swear means promise. first swear you'll take care of little pearl. guard her with your life, boy. then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. not even your mom.
i'm serious.  that's why i switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
okay.
nah, don't say anything. i'm alright.
thanks for backing me up here, uncle claude.
feelin' good's good enough.
you get ketchup?
with who?
they went after castro.  in some crazy way it got turned on kennedy.  i don't think the "p" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  it's got him shitting peach pits.
you'd better get a new alarm clock. the chief has been hollering for you.
i think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
don't touch those triggers! please. i think i've already proven that a live wayne gayle is much more better that a dead...way-- gayle. i was your passport out of jail, not duncan homolka. but me! i'll be your passport outta---
hey!
say hello to thorn.
great ass.
jack, you're wrong.
have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
you must have been concerned.
you mean they weren't up here?
that's cute.  you're funny.
you lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
what kids?...
can't be worse than any of these other fools.
maybe i'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. in south africa the numbers were small...
you taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
dorsia, yes?
i'm feeling fine this morning.
rehab. outpatient. i have to go once a week. it's kind of like aa.
i didn't give you away the first time.
where?
yes, sir.
i know.
chuck.
it's the same choice you made.
course it's a good idea.
no, what did you say on the machine?
mr. wayne ... a reminder:  tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious mr. shreck.  may we rsvp in the resoundingly negative?
any attacks of pain since?
tuesday.
what?
i always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
did i frighten you?
hmmm, you just putter. do you have to have a putter to putter?
vulcan?
i tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself first president's opposition.  du royaum uni.
take him off the air.
sorry -
what you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
fine.
hey, i showed 'em to you!
winter.  two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  which would suit me fine.
can i have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
...where is my pill?
it's not even noon --
yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
enterprise. we are the reman warbird scimitar.
then you're out and you get nothing.
the best.
no, we're not knocking boots.  i got this internship while i still was at nyu, dela was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
thanks for all you've done for me.
do you want athos arrested, your majesty?
this isn't a joke. what are we going to do!
but they know.
no. for a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
hello, peter.
i set those blocks together, patched the muscles. i put the nerves where they should be -- i did it and i did it right -- and she won't walk --
straight.
he doesn't miss a trick, does he?
who we are. don't you think they're going to be pissed?
how did you feel when i told you johnny boz had died -- that day at the beach.
no sir. i'm a veteran.
this is my favourite place in the city.
so does the history of the world for the past twenty years. i don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly i had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and i...
then god does not exist...
this whole week has gone sour. it isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  i want to go home.
george, are we gonna do this or not?
curt cobain.
what are you smiling about?  they'll be back.
and but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
which one?
otherwise you may have to what?
well i have news for you mom. it is good enough...i'm good enough and i won't leave here until i hear you tell me...
perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
yeah, you know something? i never even took a lesson, either.
uh, mr. gekko, we took a little loss today. we got stopped out on tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
i see.  how much?
none of your damn business.
let's get straight who we've talking about.  are you the man i'm interested in?
i'm starting to sense that now.
you never took a fucking vacation in your life, harry. what's going on?
just trying to have fun. that fucking prison is really starting to get to me. c'mon, seeger. gimme a push.  fuck you guys! i'll do it myself!
next time you're like watching mtv, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  i mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
be careful.
why are you always talking about we? there is no we. there is a me, there is a you. but there is no we between us.
hi, i'm honey.
maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
she's dead.
still think cuba isn't important?
really--
well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
no.
answer the man.
y'betcha, iris. we still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
and we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
one kilometer
okay.
oh no, mr. merrick. i just work there.
maybe.  or maybe i shouldn't do this interview today.
maybe i'm only one.
jesus.  he must've siphoned it from the cars.
i'm a witch. a white witch. why don't we move on?
you going to warn him?
sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but i promised the guy i'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
well...i guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  that reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  finch comes to me and says, "jessica, i need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  so i told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and i'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  so he did, and i did.
so?
don't know where she got "marie," but "samuels" figures. her boy friend's name is sam.  was she in disguise? or do you want to check the picture again?
oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, pony, the rockstar. i understand. so you, do you, want us to, leave?
it's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and i know them.  nothing alive looks like that!
vada, we're trying to work here.
ready?
i'm real sorry, laura.
aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  he knew he was holdin' ya back.
first we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or i get on top of you...
cannon or gatling?
he thinks you want him to look at evidence.
safe?
--hours before--
you're looking at him.
sam ... you haven't had dessert.
i don't love you any more.
except this time, the mission is a man.
what the hell's a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banister's?
name's norm. i live up in pompano with my folks.
captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
why?
uh, sue...?  i <u>can't</u>.
jacob, what can i do?
and what is that worth, the promise of a woman? you're very funny, highness.
don't go on like this. now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
did chloe crack?
...i'll give you a ring from venice.
i didn't know that.
a delivery device for nicotine. put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
look, you cocksucker...
...what can i say after i say that i'm sorry?  i zipped when i should've zagged, i opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
hi, ben. what are you doing with yourself these days?
see, you didn't believe me!.. now i suppose you don't think i have the courage!
up.
you take her.
well we'd sure like to help you.
why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
aaaaaaaaaaaa --
hi.
you are one scary son-of-a-gun.
admiral dougherty will not be joining us for diner. deploy the collector.  do you have a problem with those orders?
that's what it looks like, doesn't it? but that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
navigational deflectors inoperative...!  directional control also inoperative, captain...!
is he hit pretty bad?
keep warm now.
it's okay.
spit it out.
what.
so am i.
dude!
not at all, hank ... not at all. glad to help you.
what are you looking at?
i just plain don't trust him anymore.
very big beads.
can i try?
how can you say that you 'admire' them?
what if you can't find him? what if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
yes.
see the favorite? tail up. washy. he doesn't want to run today. cross him off... now the six looks good. on his toes. coat shiny. this trainer/jockey combo does well. we can't leave him out.  what do you think?
price!!
how does the family survive?
he ditched you.  you should've married me, you know.
oh yes.  why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
hey.
are you through praying?
you are not looking at your- self. you are looking at me.
walk over to the window ...
"american president"
--and your teacher said, "you're too late, truman.  there's nothing left to explore."
what the hell is that?
i don't feel too good.  i think i'm still drunk from last night.
yes.
you jivin' me?
and this -- is the master bedroom.
and blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  bit egotistical, isn't it?
i don't understand it. you can do so much good for people. as bruce wayne.
riddick. <u>riddick</u>.
joe -
but we are quite certain, comrade, that this man gardiner is a leading member of an american elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
i've been hoping to run into you.
i know, by computers.
thanks.
fine.
this is a brutal layoff...and all because they couldn't program wednesdays.
are you alright?
see you, duff.
does he still love you?
what's that?
promise me... you won't ever tell domino.
he was all right.
we looked all over for you. what are you doing back here?
had to take him to the hospital. kid had dr. zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
she's tired.
why, pray tell?
miss hayworth?
coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
i know i did. but i don't.
i want you to hear me out.
there was nothing to it.  it was my pleasure.
...in.
how ya doin' dad?
ever watched a man die?  if you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. and if you're very quick, you can catch it.
why not?
had to.  i also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with marsh.  there's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting miss lawson.
i promise.
well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. long-term parking charges by the day.
tricky little devils, aren't they? how's the degree doing?
i thought you got through that pretty well.
we just got a gold record.
i know, but this... i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex.
the graf spee...
your life?
what are you talking--
i spoke to her, and everything is all right.
you know, that night, i ... it just all came up.
no shit?
the truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
why?
of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. you know what i think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because i spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
you know, i've been traveling and i'm very tired. maybe some other time.
do you have a baby?
i'm a man without fear, wyatt.  i literally don't care if i live or die.  but even i can't fight human instinct.  somebody suddenly starts shooting at me, i duck. but you... what on earth were you thinking about?
alright. she's staying with some friends of her parents. the o'sheas. she caught the train twenty minutes ago into grand central.
where you headed?
you can do it from up here, captain.
i'm not going back to new york city.  i'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  what about you?
who am i to threaten? i'm a dying man.
dr. arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
ya see what i'm sayin'?  ha!
i promise.  dead poets honor.  come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, i swear i'll bow out.
roger, arctic warrior. i say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea. over.
really?
michael?
don't worry about me.  i can get jobs --
my... name is...
i don't want to place you in any position --
you don't understand.  about seven years ago we found the body of a guy named vasilnic in jersey.  a week later in the parking lot of madison square garden we found iman fasil. three days after that luman castageer was found in an alley.  the fourth body we've never been able to identify.  all four men died from decapitation.  nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
102  continued:
we still talking?  look, i'm sorry about the other day --
the cook again?
that!?!
i don't understand.  aren't you frightened?
i was in the brig.  they gave me a deal.  i blew up this colonel's golf cart with an m-19.  he wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  seemed like a good idea at the time.
all right –– all right.
yeah, man.
you do?
a little?
you're supposed to make time. when was the last time you told her you love her?  when was the last time you two had sex?
huey, you're losing me. what are you talking about?
oh, come on, tell us.
...shit!!  we'd found him. we waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
can i come out?  no.
have you seen it?
we already have. your father is the man who's disappeared.
my mind was not playing tricks. he was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
are you married?
how do you get this thing down?
pretty country.
mr. hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
hey, what kind of talk is that?
what's with her costume?
i wish we were investigating attila the hun.
don't be nervous.
you think i'm the white angel?
ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
dieter!
never!
what if his accomplices have made copies?
oh jesus. i'm going home.
this is bad.
turn on the flashlight.
have you ever heard of dick stensland?
okay. 
epps...
let's see how long we can stay under.
can i have milk too?
that's right, fella, no hearst paper will run an rko ad until you agree that citizen kane will never see the light of day.
he works on the movie.
i'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  let's talk about tomorrow. wanna do something?
what is it?
i read for that part.  did pretty good too.
i'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
he'll be weightless.
no i'm not okay! i don't know what the hell i'm doing!
you want to go ballistic?
you think?
it's on.
but... momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... be eye to eye on this... you don't even got to say you're sorry... just say how you knew...
i have something to tell you guys.  not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now i'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
what was that?
ooomph?
well, i thought i'd check if all of you were still here.  i'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
have you listened to his morning show, "wake up with ballplayer"?
darling, can't you see i'm relaxing in here!
but not his body.
aye, but don't rush. none of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
an ice sculpture. it's venus - the goddess of love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
no you won't.
maybe myself.
thank you very much indeed.
whose death?
but my parasite is consuming all the new memories. eating my lines.
so. what's that thing?
that's why michael and i were the wrong fit.  right from the start.
damn, ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
he's gone, hasn't he?
it's definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
this is bueno.  they had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
she's a tough lady....
how would you classify it?
i am the great and powerful oz...
beverly, are you alright?
also -- there was nothing in your report about <u>why</u> you're here.
i did, sir.
and, sometimes you control it...
let's not over do it...
i got a question, college boy.  what the hell am i supposed to do with these!?  i ask for disaster, pathos, what do i get?  salvador dali!  when i want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, i'll ask for--
wait -- hilary clinton.
i'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
i guess.  you're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
i like jazz ...
they knew of you.  now they know you.
hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
you're kidding.
i'm not.
my subscription lapsed three years ago...
i've changed the front page a little, mr. bernstein.  that's not enough - there's something i've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  i've got to make the "new york enquirer" as important to new york as the gas in that light.
why did you kill him?
... the coast guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
lemme ask you a question.  ever fuck a mutant?
rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and i've already touched your titty...
will somebody find out what's going on?!
ken.
yeah, how did you know?
we still have to go in there sometime.
are you suggesting a duke's son is an animal?
i am not!
jack.
what are you doing?
well, stop it. you know what i want to hear.
juliet!
it's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
i will, frank, i will. something came up, okay?
... you will join us for dinner, won't you, mr. gardiner?
huh?
she's very tired, poor creature. you know me: i'm a real pig. it's not so easy cleaning up after me.
he's trying to form words.
tell me. what do you want?
well there. you don't need me half as much as you think you do. you already know what must not happen.
how long?
i just heard you.
i didn't want you to be upset. i shouldn't have lied. stacy, there's nothing between me and rachel banks.
no.  the money, please.
what the hell is plan-r?
i know. she bought him a ticket for lathrop wells and put him on the bus. he didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
no.  i don't.  but i always said to myself, when i die, i want to die laughing.
alfredo died. do you remember him?
we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. we were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. and i got out and i just started walking.
i've been to information adjustments. they sent me here. they told me you had a form i had to fill in.
not a lot.  i saw inside of the science center.  what exactly happened?
what the hell are you doing here?
yes, you do. now concentrate.
uhhh... i have no idea what you just said.
first tell me this similarity is not incredible.
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government.
a little modesty would suit you better.
i've got numbers to back me up. over the course of one year more americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of world war ii.
fifty million!  are we talkin' united states dollars?
larry!
and what happens when you can't?
all hands. battle stations!
i'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
oh no. no visa.
but that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
absolutely.
i have to go back . . .to the fortress . . .
i'm thinking.
so you want me to take her out?  is that an order from the president?
no, z.  the squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  you're a good ant, z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  i don't wanna see anything happen to you.  so quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
don't drag my ass into this --
thanks...for all your help.
lips still for sale?
ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
the ones who could disburse the money.
yes, i do, it's very good.
so what can i get you?
how do i look?
that's what life is, doctor. full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
let her go. she didn't kill anybody.
...that's an old one.
i think i've seen this nut somewhere.  haven't i?
i... i do not know.  i no longer know what i think or what i feel.
christ, what...
--and he says chapin hired segretti--
this is my stop.
the--head?
doctor, it may sound odd, but i believe i've profited from my stay here. it's just what i've needed, to get away like this. but i'm recuperated now. i've had lots of time to think and i've made a few decisions about my life. i'm ready to get on with it.
i'll be back in a couple of hours. and be careful with her, will you?
you know what gets me about that cadillac?
valerie doran? two floors up, one window over.
friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
don't stop...  do no stop.
how can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
i'm sorry.
i don't want you within two hundred feet.  park down by the lifeguard station.  nobody gets out.
sorry about that harry, first time i've brought a friend up there. you okay?
edmunds, get in here.  i need you for this.
... is accusing me of rape.  jimmy told me.  apparently i'm the last to know...
hello?
oh sure.  i know what people think. it's like, oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- i also play football, by the way -- but that's like...not <u>all</u> that i am.
i drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
...and, and, and did she...?  and she did the seven shows...
it worked, didn't it?
what's a sign for that?
five years ... i still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, matty would still be alive.
we know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. we'll pray to find you some honest work.
i'm telling you it's a forgery. the paint's still wet for god's sake.
what's it to you?  i declare it.  here i am, back in the states for less than a month --
beautiful.
bud--why did you do this?
if they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. first hint of that, they'll be on to the dss, 'this cunt's no trying' and your giro is fucking finished, right?
but where did they get those people?
this is farewell.
...at her request.  she was a very religious woman.
thank you.
the hell you're not.
she's an awfully good reporter--i can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
saving people is not our job.  it's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
i'm all right.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
make a choice, bruce.  her or me.
don't you like her?
i was hopin' you'd be there.  maroon's called here about four times.  he says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  he says he can help you.
and how do we release the power?
in what way?
the adm. let's go.
come on holly!
what are you thinking of, bella? can i eat dry?
never mind that. if you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
looks bad? i'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
private kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
wrap it around that rock twice.
no, not exactly a man of the people.  "also known as vigo the cruel, vigo the torturer, vigo the despised, and vigo the unholy."
what a touching story.
sit down? what are . . .
i'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
no, it's like a safety. we are going to have to access the manual controls.
when i went to england i was amazed at what went on, the waste - i'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - india could live for a hundred years on what i saw thrown away.
you're kidding. you wrote a song? is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
yeah, i've had it forever.  i used to have this thing with marking the words that i looked up.
november.  '71.
i think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  a little scared... and a lot curious.  maybe more than you want to admit.  but doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  think of it as broadening your horizons.
deputy art lewis, jerome county sheriff's department.
what's in big sur?
well, obviously, we got to go back.
is this a lover?
so you're from around here?
we came back to the house!
i am not comfortable with this.   i'm not a good liar.
these supplies...?
bear, you're not really gonna –-
motherfucking soundman! i couldn't hear myself sing!
it means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand.
aphrodite baggot who does it behind the dog and trumpet?
we've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
he's got a gift for fiction.
yes.  thank you.  but i think we both know there's more to it than that.  do you believe in fate, neo?
flame-units only.  i want rifles slung.
guess what?  we show, and n.s.a. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the canadian border.  there are no nuclear devices in albania.  z'at put us in something of a pickle?  albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in the albanian hinterland.  the f.b.i. and the border patrol, and the r.c.m.p. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque canadian border.  the albanian government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  there is no war.
i expected nothing else.
who is this?
algeria.
why thank you.
i'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
no, just a friend of mine. i don't think he likes jell—o.
go around him.
...that's awful.  i hope you killed, that asshole?
they're stragglin'.
no, no, of course not. it's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. so when there was no word from him...
where's your program? won't it miss you?
melissa!
will this light do? don't artists need good light?
i figured i could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
i'm a-tryin', ma. honest i am.
we'd better get back now.
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
make them go faster, mr.... ?
why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
but recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. what keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
nothing for me.  i understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
quite a spell, i reckon.
that boat is my livelihood!
ok. but do me one last favor, will you. can you give me two hours? that's all i ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. i suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
your father??
do i know you?
and these archies should be over here with the richie rich's.
i'll have somebody's ass for this. i'll have your ass, soldier. i'm not gonna stand here and...
so why didn't you kill me then?
down western avenue. we were going sixty-five miles an hour. you know what i mean?
macbeth.
mother! you called me by name!
would i mind? do i have a choice?
a lot of what happened is jagged. pieces missing. i can't really remember. i just get flashes. usually in my dreams. i'd kind of gotten used to them. at least accepted them....
cool.  i could actually use a couple of allen wrenches.  what do you need?
of course. why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  you just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. it's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. you make them work for you.
hold it.  whoa... what's your name, son?
you got some nerve.
times being what they were, i accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  and in that balloon, my dear dorothy, you and i will return to the land of e pluribus unum!
yeah, but, when i was walking, i realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. he's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? he's not free. he's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
thirty-two minutes left...  but chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
the captain...
national television?
i know who y6u are.  you're dorothy boyd.  you're in... wait... you're in accounts.  you have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of albert einstein morphed onto shaquille 0 neal's body.
don't listen to him, little sister. when you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
am i right?
i'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? like a soldier.  like a samurai.
oh.
another dozen out back.
you'll be sucked down too!
you must not look to me for help. your brother is no longer my problem. he is now your problem, conway.
here. what do i do next?
can i borrow a piece of --
come again... ?
well, what's the difference? i just need it.
that's okay.  just an ex-girlfriend. and know i remember why.
he broke because of me. i saw it. he lost all will to fight.
really?
who else can give me information about you?
at least you're honest for once. so now you want to be my friend? well, let me tell you something, claude-my- shit-don't-stink-banks. you got a lot to learn about friendship.
you have a strong unfufilled desire.
that, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
is he like that in real life?  so gorgeous?
where's ma?
i'll tell you another thing.  we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution, now we lead with television commercials. we're the best, it's as simple as that.  even the americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  we've got the lot.  nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  that food you're eating.
mr helpmann was very close to your poor father. he was very close to me. still is. he'll take you under his wing at information retrieval. you'll like it when you get there.
well, look. how's this? you go on down to the clinic and tell that nice dr. st. luc...  ...you tell him that nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. tell him to come when you're sure nick'll be home. and don't tell nick anything. let the two of them fight it out.
rufus, play it back...
i... i never lied!
i never let one go by me when i could catch her.
sir?
david reynolds, i'm the manager here. sit down, john.
eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
i don't mean to alarm you, but i'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
add it to the list.
baby, please don't... i love you.
peace, everybody--paul, penelope.
good job, not pretty, but good.
two hundred.
it's going to be all right, jake. it's going to be all right. don't be afraid. i've got you now.
your hole is healed, then?
then we must call the police.
birdy--
things are probably going to end badly for you, jake.
what if he's busy tonight?
i have to get you home by one.
you played bouncy-bouncy with sheila, so i'm gonna play blue-face with you. 
christ, what channel are we on?...
she's always spying on me. she creeps into the room. she lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
hey!!
what do you want?
"what we want is in that room."
that big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
you did this for me?
you want to make a wager on this?
finish him, finish him. your way.
you gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
detroit.  snoopy miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
what, i couldn't hear you?
his funeral - imagine it! the cathedral, all vienna sitting there. his coffin, mozart's little coffin in the middle. and suddenly in that silence, music. a divine music bursts out over them all, a great mass of death: requiem mass for wolfgang mozart, composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri. what sublimity! what depth! what passion in the music! salieri has been touched by god at last. and god, forced to listen. powerless - powerless to stop it. i at the end, for once, laughing at him. do you understand? do you?
that's right. that's what i said. you have a good memory. then what?
that is the general idea, yes...
no.  i could have, though.
what if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  i mean, they could be in rio de janeiro.
i go to the blue'n gold barber shop in westwood. the guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
when it's a threat, you'll know it.
last time i saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
snoopy.  glenn michaels.
that's connie rivers with her. they're married now.  she's due about three-four months.
no joke.  serious.
asshole that does not count as a kill.
he's falling for her. look at him.
i can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  and that's the catch. she doesn't want a boyfriend.
how'd you get here so fast?
it's in michigan. honestly, what do i have in common with those people? or with anyone?
not going to open?
bluff. you've waited too long.
follow that boat!
yeah. i heard you and ratan just came from mexico. and that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
who?
scotty, how long is this bay?
listen to yourself.   why would i do anything like what you're describing?
i don't have any money, solomon. if you fire me --
sure dear, yes.
that was incredible. you're brilliant!
okay.  and is there a place nearby i could go to vomit?
you don't say.
<i>where</i> in fiji?  what island?
better re-load it.
come early. the view is so romantic from my balcony.
<u>how</u>...?
get out of here.
do you think lorna hates her? i don't think she hates her. i mean she may resent her a little...
major dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
you want to go home?
second floor girls' john! two minutes! he'll never look there!
and then what... he touched you?  did you maybe flirt a little...
yeah.
that crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
late renaissance, i think.  caravaggio or brunelleschi.
oh, those are only local. wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
cheer up. now you can give some other guy a shot. make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
you ok?
you're not pregnant, are you?
gallon or two?
shut up!
to yourself, that's where.
i have recorded the transmission.
that's the way to train 'em. looks like mrs. pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
johnny, i have something to tell you.
nothing. i just watch till something strikes me. do anything you think of -- try different thing. until i say, "hold that pose." then just try and comfortably hold it.
i'm sorry, but it's important.  clay shaw is important.  i'm sorry.
i don't know. i don't remember doing it.
yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- i'm sorry, jabez.
and i die naked?!  ugh! this is complete bullshit. who wrote this piece of crap?
he's what?
are you in trouble over this, mr. crawford? can senator martin do something to you?
ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
hi.
excuse me i have to make a call...
look -- i'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- i'll give you twenty -- for god's sake, will you let me use that phone?
taylor, i'd rather you -
ever go to church?
this is just a test case, o'neil. but if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the navy's official policy on women in combat.  or, actually, its official non-policy.  now who's your immediate superior there?
what kind of a question is that?
hey, great they're back.
what do i think?  i think it's a lovely idea....
government.
martha louise livingston.
pardon, good mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
shhh. i need to concentrate on the blockbuster if i'm gonna destroy it.
a hot story, huh?
fazeli...i don't know no buzz fazeli.
i just have to get something. i'll be right back.
ok. that's wrong.
why would anyone do this?
you're a fuckin' star! and you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
that's funny because, you know, i just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. he called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
one seventy-nine.
nervous?
hi.  my name is violet.  we sort of met in the elevator --
don't know. i'd have to see on what you base your claim. i presume you feel you're justified in—
watch it.
can i?
uh... is this the right bus?
who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
i bet you're a damn good poker player.
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. i guess i'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
shall i alert dr. mccoy?
what?
i don't know. two or three. it was pretty late.
yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck i am.
come on, annie. bob and i have been planning on it all week.
to be honest, i don't go to the pictures much, mr. lipnik –
what?
i'm just thinking out loud here, but... two million in a briefcase?
i can't....
i'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
yes, sir. the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
oh, thank g-d!  i'm not just super fat!
serves me right for asking a direct question. the subject is closed.
yes... no, it is not unreasonable. although i--
i dunno.  where's erica mother?
don't remind me.
i didn't. he was cruel enough to let me live.  even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
so be it, to the death.
not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
i just don't want to fight with you.
chauncey!
yes, you shouted the words "captain god" at me for no reason...
number three.
why is everything...like this?
that depends.
what i mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. we're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
you don't seem bothered.
pull up!  we did it!  holy shit, we did it!  pull up!
he's betrayed the class.
what -- what are you doing?
wallowing quite literally in blood.
what are you trying to say? just because i dress well and like to dance --
nothing up there... the grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
i never should have listened to you.
...aconite get it dat cheap.
this is captain pavel chekov speaking. you are in violation of neutral zone treaty. i advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
don't worry, honey
yeah, but i feel like crap. and if you feel like crap, it’s way better to look hot while you’re doing it.
you must be related to the lavals of marseilles.
you live here.
mr. president, just what do you think you're doing?
then why are you smiling like that?
you win.
respect, i always dished ya respect.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry mike & ike's?
we know.
so you see, this post is very important to me right now.
charlie. how are you.
don't you like him?
christ, ken, you know it's not that easy.
what was that?
to see if he can get away with it.
get up, willa.
somebody's coming!
she's gonna be out there, man. right there. right there waiting.
plumb busted out. looks like the hard road finally got to mister lucas war hero.
so tell me ... am i still an angel?
pacqualinincheewa root.
so... you brought dino in, and he brought machine.  and, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  and she never walked out.
you were there to help dr. marx deliver her baby. were you not?
like a stroke?
i don't remember.
well, how do i look?
a means to an end, is that it?
i don't ever see any of you precops down here, i'm not in trouble am i?
your eyes...
you've said that enough!...maybe lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if i hear it from you again, i'll fight ya, mr. edwards!
hello?
why?
you, uh... i'm sorry, sir, but -
hear what?
jonas?
yeah?
hold it down, nick!
but i'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, i mean  oh, shoot! no, saturday night i'm gonna-  gonna sing. yeah.
how?
been thinking?
hello, reggie -- i am waiting for jean-louis.
the team is in mourning, darling.
jake.  i thought you would be at work, dear.
do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
that's crazy!  why would i draw attention to myself like that?
you?
i think thomas pynchon's a genius.
you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- gabriela is relevant.  when i spoke to you before i didn't know she'd been seeing eduard.
so what do you think?
that's what i'm talkin' 'bout. that's what i'm talkin' 'bout.
yes, sir.
it's beautiful.
sure.
you got your own nightclub?
it wasn't much of a letter...
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
recover any bodies?
what's wrong?
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and i have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  but <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
dickie greenleaf?
you work in the insurance department?
she's not tied up!
whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. and i presume you can't get in.
i would have said it was impossible, but i believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
hey? . you like to walk.
frogs?
i don't know his name ...  i saw the whole story.  a wounded bird was on his roof.  i could hear its cries from here. he went straight to it.  i couldn't've. i'd be frozen between pity and fear. but he wasn't.  its pain spoke directly to him.  he picked it up.  nursed it. fed it.  and it got better.  everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  everyday the pigeon would watch him. i saw him learn. learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. and one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  didn't look back.  but he heard the sound of its wings.
john, where's your folks?
you're a lying bastard!
he went to the men's room.
like you said jack, i'm just a new york lawyer now.
so?
he doesn't scare me. i'll kick his ass in.
did you say <u>dmitri?</u> how do you know about my case?  i don't understand...
jesus holly, we got enough time.
no offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
now we've got a straight shot, due north, to ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, st. mere, then bernay.  we'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside, i'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
sir te, can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter?
leon - meet us at 63rd and madison. hair salon.  ludwig's.
so what are you saying?  that the world of the supernatural is your special province?
cleo, i've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
don't push it, larry.
two.
well then i guess we should just give up.
they owe us, man.  that's the least they can do.
repartee, dick -- very good.  hey, i feel ten years younger!  it makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! how's the lawyer life?
well, i hope you'll stay with us.
ok toots, i will.
i thought you'd be happy.
you walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
we need to talk to you about the alien.
what did you tell him about the baby?
what is going to happen?
how come you get all the good stories, lois?
where's all your things, jeffrey?
diem?  trujillo?  lumumba?  guatemala? cuba? ... it's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, dick.
a what?
but i gave her my word. besides, she's still your legal guardian. my hands are tied.
my friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
no, we're stealing.
i thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
you have to go. you always did such, uh, you know, great work. i still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
how much money's in that casino? day-to-day.
no, i want to see the dessert cart.
--there's that word again.  i have a feeling this man doesn't play the odds, detective.  not exactly a slave to probability.  is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
wait. don't.
mama...
you all right?
what do you get out of it?
mare island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  how are we going to get me in there?
and that, my lord, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.
...and here is the key to the mini- bar. room and tax has been picked up by cardiff giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
thank you for this honor, my dear.
hicks, don't let him leave.
get off my property!
i like it.
what did you do?
i've missed you, man ...
what with?
what are his symptoms?
doesn't that scare you?
good day.
is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? i must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
we've been through this.
distracting enough for you?
eight to five little boy blue is plastered.
every single one of those pictures is somebody italian.
yeah.
kids? what about them?
don't know, joe.
but brother bembry says i'm tall enough for a tall man.
oh, jesus! did you see what god just did to us?
the door was open.
i don't know.
what a great kite.
because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    ah.  and here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
his own doctor?
so what're we looking for?
radar!
stop treating this like i'm going away with a man. he's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. i hate this, mom -- i hate this. he's a freak show -- the worst person i ever met.
constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
yeah, well, you fixed that.  what the hell happened, anyway?
i'm afraid you have to eat something.
shit. you better tell me something.
excuse me. i was just going up to my room.
you're right. i'm cracking up. ignore me.
what's she doing?
where do i find you?
you mean now or before?
you thinking what i'm thinking?
yes.
yeah. is that you, jeff?
...now, i know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
once a week?
it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon. i was going to clerk for the supreme court.
sorry.  i mistook me for somebody else.
he's got something to tell you, auggie.
you let me make a fool of myself! you lied to me! i don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. it’s your job. it’s who you are. how would you even know if something were real?
except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  don't forget how far we are from the colonies, martin.
yeah i know.  patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  he doesn't want any attention.
i think we better go home.
we are better here.
how about it?
very official.  259-7881, if i recall.
he found you, didn't he?
mind if i smoke a jay?
i'll pay for you.  even though you owe me money.  we have to do something with the money i earn.  i need to. i deserve it.  you can just think of it as winning the lottery.
no. we're going to lock this up and --
i remember you now.  shit.
stop.  we still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
i had the four o'clock shift. you weren't there. you had us worried. is everything okay?
just one?
yes.
do you see the maintenance panel?
i mean...
i could always get us a bottle.
just get him to stop.
what a day i've had!
you've seen my files, right?  seen the things i've done?
the drawing shows a priest named sankara who lived centuries ago.
randy stetz is in jail.
i mean, you know, at least i admit that i don't know. i know that things are fucked up beyond belief and i know that i have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? i don't have an answer. i don't have a fucking message.
law enforcement?
are these all of her previsions?
so beautiful, irena. so beautiful.
yeah.
i'll see you around.
what makes you ask?
i know -- i know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- i know he is ill.
"neat"! there's that- what are you- twelve years old? that's one o' your chippewa falls expressions! "he thinks i'm neat."
yes, thank you.
cigarette?
it was softer'n i thought, that was my main impression. you know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
mallory, what did you think of mickey's plan? did you think it would work?
it's what?
not on duty, sorry.
biederman! where's biederman!
you don't know many of citizen barras' friends, do you?
we’re almost done here...
hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the judge...
we get to the bridge, we're all right!
not bad. you?
stop being so fucking melodramatic! if it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
we'll pray anyway.
he's gonna kill her no matter what. if i take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
why?  i don't know.
you're so beautiful.
still working on it.
evening gown?
chef.
no, i didn't.
get in line, bro.
but what can we do? she don't know who's visiting her...
why didn't you tell me? you said you hadn't seen him for a month.
you'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  switch to another station, huh? you're driving me crazy with that.
and?
can you fly?
i think you're lying.  that's what kind of problem.
very little.
hi, is this your first time calling?
huh?
and what would i find out that i haven't known for years.  what makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. you had to make a record ... for the whole world.
not everyone can have x-ray vision, you know.
when you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? who did you call?
he does, does he?
don't even.  you're not going to show me that tired map.
what makes you so sure it was me? she coulda had lotsa bowlers! theo rushes buzz and grabs his arm. the two men struggle for the pin.
well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  when he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
you told me what?
yeah.
assistant insructor... you must be some kind of a hot stick. should i call you "sir" ?
i agree.  we play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
it was... something meeting you.
i lost my head. i'm... sorry. i don't know what happened.
who's this 'bruce'? are you trying to make me jealous?
they never got that big.
my daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  put her on your squad and i'll give you the guns.
you want to canvass?
how?
call me!
ah, there's the rub...
cledus.
you sure your friend got the right place?
exactly, which means i can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
shit!
we don't know what we're into!
ten to one, o'connell, your odds are no-so-good.
jerry! blackie! queenie! let's have it quiet, fellows!
look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? maybe we can change our location.
yeah, four years ago.  they had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  i'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  then the whack club i'm on loses three games in a row and i get blamed.  so they fire me.
who are they?
let's make a deal.  <u>other</u> than my blood, what can i off--
stantz?  you okay in there?
mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. i can't make him out.
hello bill.
when do we go?
i thought it was an obscene phone call.
what the hell would you call this?
adult education is such junk! the professors are so phony. how can you do it?
you don't have to lie... you could exaggerate.
need some help?
corporal, the roughnecks are moving out for planet p immediately. get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics.
oh, for chrissakes. it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
i didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why i didn't say anything....
reverend edwards.
gail. i hope this won't embarrass you in any way. i think underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
tell me, mrs. kramer, are you employed at the present time?
how did you know that?
no hemoglobin left. their metabolisms are too fast.  they burn out.  that's why they're having to feed so often.  their systems are self destructing.
the precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
it is a class d-12 bird of prey. they were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
what's that for?
are you saying she was-
i've tried to warn you. scientists are always pawns of the military --
dee.  god damn it.  i told you to go home.
dr. green...
scully?
you know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
why? you're not a real man?
i'm thirty.
yes.
and cut that out right now.
ass like your, i can see why he's worried you'll punk.
i got to talk to my ado...
y-yes, jim.
claire...hey...
she has the face of an angel. what a pity you can't see her.
in the car.
stop.  you experimented in college. i don't want to hear about that.
get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
what is it?
go for the eyes. like in episode 22 with-
adamant?
and you chased one?
but you have had mistresses while you were away.
why don't you ask your chief detective?
congratulations, ensign mayo, sir!
that's true. uncle pooch wasn't really an uncle. he was a business partner of my daddy's? and my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. his real name was somethin' kind of european, like pucinski. but everyone just called him pooch. he came around the house sometimes when daddy was away. i always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, i was surprised more'n a little.
there's no one in my motherfuckin closet and stay out of my bedroom, stay out of my god damn bedroom.
we must blow the first note... he note that will take us to asgaard...
no options.
and why.  is that?
would somebody wake me in five minutes?
don't, no, please.  will you-- no, don't...
i'm the one who understands you. now, can we be allies?
listen:  top dollar.  he "owns the street here."  he will "erase my ass."
we'll get them, sir... these things take time.
ben?
this is a declaration of insurrection!  who wrote this!?
how much more do we have to take from him?
tell the baby about me.
catch your breath.
no.  who's art mooney?
now the second image.  watch the water.  the wind's changed.  the ripples are going the other way.
i tell you it doesn't exist!
fortunately such news comes very slowly where i live.
how may i help you?
i asked you what you think of rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
a little place with cabins. the something-motor inn. i haven't checked in yet.
good.
i'll come to you tonight.
why don't you guys buy your own?
always?
mitchell's out of his mind now. martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
marry who?
it doesn't matter, i didn't tell h...
especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
yes, that sudden.  if it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  it's all your fault.
you just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  he made a big settlement on you.
tim, what are you talking about?
you're a grown man.  i'm not responsible for you.
it doesn't matter who they are.
i like mary. i like when she comes to visit. i just don't think she likes me.
why, i was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
i just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
school.
hi.
while i am in france fighting to expand your future kingdom i learn that stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! and you have done nothing?!
don't say anything about anything.
the great morpheus.  we meet at last.
no, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
he turned out all right.
now that's the kind of motorcycle i want to see you on.
awaiting my orders.
disney! how inter...
try a year and a half. he bands her an old snapshot. pilar looks at it--
he will fight you forever. but what does he fight for? freedom first, and peace. so grant them.
whoa, this kicks ass! huh huh huh.
she wasn't happy.  i was someone to talk to.
they call it a new look at an old favourite i copied it from the 'window on the world' show.  the far east meets the mid-west!
indeed we were.
i don't want to stay here.
don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play!  plato never got a book advance...
i'm so sorry.
i thought he was dead.
come and get him.
who's --
thanks, man. you need anything, you call.
girls can't be cowboys.
i wouldn't do that.  the doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
i told you it would happen. it's bound to happen when a man works alone!
thank you. it is a pleasure to have you here, major.
right.  what about sweating lecktor?
we're all manipulated. from the moment we're born. the event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before i was even born.
those are pretty hostile words.
yes.
say, isn't that dr. barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
we'll have to leave that up to the c.i.d. boys, won't we, major?
norman johnson.
everybody that i care about dies.
you're making fun of my family. you know there's nothing to steal from my mom and craig. you know exactly what you're saying.
what do you want?
she's dead.
i'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
wow, dream big!
i-i-i-i c-c-c-came over s-s-s sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and i s-s-said, i said, 'c-c-c-celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
mr. kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. i have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  i am a fan.
are you sure about that?
how can you call it a good thing? a graveyard for pets killed in the road! built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
hi.  up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  we're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
boy, i bet you'd go to a hanging.
..."how now, cried arthur. 'then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'that is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
that you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
hear what?
and then sam, you and i clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
then what is he...?
who else is interested in me?
that's funny--so was i.  guess the ocean makes one sentimental
you think that's all we busted -- you should see...
every other sunday.  i'm heavyweight champion of the west virginia.
you did it.
but if i am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and i know i won't live to see you another time.  my life is in danger here. do i sound screwy?
really?
mayo, are those your friends?
those are mine!
i couldn't mail it; i didn't know your address. but i had a landmark. i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you.
mmmmmmmmmm! mmmmmmmmmmmm!
are you getting mom something for her birthday?
are you going out somewhere?
revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? i bought into it ten years ago. it was my first real estate deal. i sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. it was better than sex. at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world...  now, it's a day's pay ... i had a mole in wildman's employ. gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
...yeah...
i'm melanie.
it don't bother me none.
very strange.
answer the question.
yes, with all due respect, i do citizen barras.
i'm somewhat less so. we seem to have a bit of a problem...
you told him i was throwing a deuce, right?
what is this?
i love you.
she your only sibling?
i had doubts too.  i always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. but something happened ...
i...
they could've been brothers. it's why the eyewitnesses picked shu.
yeah. i'm not saying you should get a tattoo. but you should make yourself happy.
i guess. his parents are. he doesn't care about that.
wait a minute.  this is the woman i love.  what's going on? who was loaded?
she's in the other room.  i just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. but it's time for her to die now.
get to sleep indy -- i stay up and keep eye on things...
who are you? -- an embezzler most likely.
elena!...but when...
tell <u>me</u> everything.
hey! just remember i made you.
sorry.
oh?  anyplace else?
lisa, simmer down -- will you?
i want you to come to my house. then we'll talk.
no, mom. you know i wouldn't break my promise.
this ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  the implications go way beyond.
now you're making sense.
you told me what you could. i guess i'm through with your part of it.
do you love him, loretta?
well how do we look?
oh, i don't know.  my unemployment checks are running out.  um, i was thinking of taking some courses at columbia with the last of my savings.
are you okay?
that's good, but heather would never use the word "myriad."
--and i guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... i suppose the most important thing, really. i don't know. anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. it's my shrink, really.
i'm sorry.  about before.
yes. not my department ... i'm only records. it seems that mr buttle was overcharged by information retrieval. i don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... i suppose we're all human.
not really to live, just to play.
listen. submit. you hear me?  you're strong. you stay alive. i will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
i'll wish you a happy birthday now and i'll see you soon. all right, darling?
what the  --  !
oh, bullshit, mary. it's because rhodes is a prick.
uh-huh.
don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
i killed him.  when i was 15.  he was my first.  nah, wishful thinking.  liver cancer.
<u>who</u> are these guys...?
we'll be praying for you.

not unless you hear my confession.
what's the matter?  where's your husband, young lady—
i consider it less my failure than his.
of course i like girls.
no.  we are insane.  who else but crazy men would film their murders?  so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. but what good is money there?  because once in hospital i say i not crazy. just pretended to be acquitted.  we see psychiatrists.  they must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  oh - i got it.  because of your double jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  we come out free, rich and famous!
cassie, thank christ!  we're under attack.

how long were you having sex with him?
you think he still loves her?
my home number's on the back...
oh.  do you think i have a potential as a writer?
why would they want to find out? we're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. why would they want to lock us out?  and besides, they'll never find out. all you gotta do is keep changing your job title. like, uh, from casino executive to food and beverage chairman. and what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. i know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
is this a test, sir?
mr. follett.
and you can't count horst buckholtz anyway.

i just wanted to know where mom was?
just what i said. don't look so scared.
the chinese have a proverb: "that which appears too good to be true, usually is." there's gotta be a catch.
see, that's what i'm saying. it has the logic of a dream.
what are you drunk?
not really.  it's pretty boring.
five's not so many. there were families with seven kids. a grandmother. a dimwit uncle.
no, you don't understand. she's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
so what brings you here?
costliest!
i don't want to go back.
of siegfried...
you said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? this doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
what people?
figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  how you gonna get a boat?
i don't know. 'cause you're cute.
what's going on?

but i didn't mean to do it!
you okay?
did they argue the day before he died?
no. but you can buy a drink for my friend, taro.
no.
just after leland street.
i knew you'd come. and i knew i'd have to come up here and talk to you. i couldn't let you go back without any word. i came to tell you again -- jessica cannot be cured.
he was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  on his rounds.  and... and...
and you're from the future too?
we'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
as soon as you want.
that's close enough, major.
no.
remember i told you my father was a policeman?  ricky tan was his partner for ten years.
that's their position?  you've certainly got them surrounded.  i suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
do you know what this is? it's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
well, all the same, i'm going to advise starfleet and get instructions.
what was it like?
can you prove any of this?
it's my condition. i never know if i've already eaten, so i always just eat small amounts.
i can take care of myself.
pardon me. senator paine decided this *with* you?
photographer?
what? are you kidding me? who sent you here?
what... is... happening... ?
sure.
we've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
plan b is your dad.
rick! rick, help me!
i have waited for you, my son, for a long time. i have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. i have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that i might find you . my friend, it is not an arduous task that i bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. to be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
i'll be ready.
john, we - - what i'm just saying....
you got me, peanut.
was there anything in those offices that didn't go to d.c.?

please... i wasn't there... ask pimm.
oh my god...!
he's performing at some place outside of richmond, virginia.
please, ilsa, don't be hasty.
two o'clock.
actually, some of the richest people i know have the worst manners.  of course, mr. harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  all right now, pay attention please.  salad fork.
don't bother.
but andy also took orders. and when he was told to give a pension fund loan to philip green...
i can't see. what are they doing, what's happening?
that old standing offer from diz moore--poet of washington correspondents.
yeah, but i want carmen.
excuse me.
boyfriend?
do you ever get an erection for a woman?
ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
they asked who would be best suited for this and you--
put your arms around me.
are you talking to me!
i know how you feel -- i been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. you know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
come right in - i'll get you a drink.
what's wrong?
you're staying home.  you're not going out.
what are you doing?
what the hell's goin' on?
don't underestimate me.  i've got original ideas of my own.  warhol got famous doing a soup can.  what would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
we don't even like them,  i've often thought of giving it away, but oliver wouldn't stand for it.  it was his first wife's favorite picture.  she was an artist.
sure, dave, what's up?
well , who's in command here?
i don’t know what your problem is, but...
they're probably guilty about what they did to me.

if we find ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned b.a.r. back to the beach for me.
you want to join the harold ryan fan club?  wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
if this is a joke, it's not funny.
he left us!  he left us!
we're on our way.  alan-one gave me the coding we need to go up against master
that happens.
it's also our only way out of here! it holds three people.  and there's only three of us left now.

couldn't help but overhearing.  two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  i wish you the very best.
"fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  they'd been together ten years.
okay.
that's what i came to see you about.
no!  don't kill him!  pendergast, you were right.  it's john!
not us, i hope.
you know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.

i will never get tired of hurting you, eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
why?
oh. but haven't we met before?
i am happy to hear you say this, chairman mao. i have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished inherited tax, and forgiven all money owed the government by people who are unable to pay.
is it over?
there's this thing out there.  this paternity suit.
uh-huh?
you're a good man... she was right to have chosen you...
i know it's not the greatest.  it's commercial.
you usually eat alone?
that's all you got from him? that bastard helped take your life away from you.
well, it was just an idea -- i hate to see a ticket go to waste --
no, but he's going to be by tomorrow. he's aging.  'bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  in that time he'll be an old man.  could be a year, an hour, or all at once. called npa syndrome.  natural pro- gression of aging.  it affects each individual differently.  i'm sure it's painful.

it's about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo. at the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. he opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. everything she knew or ever became was because of him. and she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
that's your story!
...i need to make a phone call.
yeah, and i know ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... i wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
i guess i'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
come on rachel.
have you identified it?
i owe you, since i goofed up this one.
if the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  old, too old. fat, too fat.
actually, you're a different breed. this creature will never evolve.
give you three minutes.
oh. i'm very sorry. well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
macey, i know you're tired, but can you drop me at the retinal fetish? it's on your way.
she's the one to blame. not me.
grateful?
i think i remember.
i'm sorry.
no, see, i don't need a finder's fee, i need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. i need the principal.
talk to him about it.  he'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
screw regulations!  four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
you heard right.
it smells damp.
would you like to come along?
better let the doc take a look at you, after dinner.
agent mulder --
and this is the return you make for his kindness!  didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of jamesville yonder?
why should it?
i didn't say a word.
i don't know. something.
shut up, tod!  be serious!
not that i know.
you think i should go to the party, mr. marliston?
nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  i hope she comes.
well, i went down to atlantic city -
there's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
that's like... those people stitching nikes in panama saying they're in the nba.
where do you think you're going?
resent it all you want, henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. cambodia, ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  the president wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to harvard yard.  it's your ass too, henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. what was that?
lieutenant... is there... a russian attack?
got me out of trouble.
leave me alone!
excuse me?
what?
i think so too.
is it night or day, erik?
i'm fine. i have to get going to my friends' house.  was it --
oh, jean's okay. but there's three people up in brainerd who aren't so okay, i'll tell ya that.
i haven't been able to get you off my mind.
even the bedchamber passages!  let none remain!
i talked to johnnie white at the bar association.  the broad used to work for one of concannon's partners in new york awhile ago.  she wanted to move to boston.  how badly did she hurt us, joe?
thank you, fidel castro.
i need to ask you a question.  what made you get in touch with joanne braslow?
hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. i was panicking for a moment, but i've got my senses back now. the situation is, i'm shot in the belly. and without medical attention, i'm gonna die.
i'm sorry i messed up. you've been very kind to me ...  but all good things have to come to an end, right?
max.
let's not get into this again. i know him.  if you said something, he'd take it out on me.
write down drexl's address.
yes, i'm glad you're clean but i've been calling and calling.
i'm sure of it. just as i'm sure there's a wish for shangri-la in everyone's heart. i have never seen the outside world. but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. oh, i just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
and you came up with that?
rooney's protecting someone.  who is she protecting?
what's that noise?
draggin' the name of the lord through the evil mud of his soul!
if we find sid, lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
what show ?
you--don't know it, do you?
gee -- i don't know... the space man, i guess.
you better not sing that song.
mom, you hitched all the way to berkeley once, remember?
hello! hello! --
you're sure of that.
david, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying i faked the figures. you're not going soft on me, are you?
i detest serpents.
cool off, we're seniors.
these are wonderful.
there's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. it happened like this before, in 1916, when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach, in long island.
really?
yes, where?
you looking for me?
-- it's because of the sex, isn't it? you don't like the sex in it.
and neither do you. it's up to rennie to decide what she wants to do.
you come home with me.
i get final approval. it's in my contract.
do not let the waters touch you.
i am. i am, sir.
i feel fine.
i'm going to say i'm 104% sure.
i dunno... okay, i guess...  i fucked that guy josh finally...
"a.d."
oh, no, really - i'll be all right.
yeah?
i can believe that.
marion. it's a book.
who?
don't!
come on.
are you dictating my position to me? we're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
we're just not a very musical nation...
i had everybody working.  even our old babysitter.
he bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
'stanwyk's parents, marvin and velma stanwyk, also of provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
it's here!!!
and let my policy expire?  sorry.
yes, mary patrick?
what?
no.
wish i knew you better.
i appreciate your dilemma, memphis. but how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
you gotta admit, they do love him.
well, hi!
what do you mean?
...what's the big deal? everyone steals from everyone.
karen.
i don't know. ruth kept her cool, but i could tell she was surprised.
this is ridiculous!
good luck, jukka.  do a good show.
"can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
let's all talk about mary.
the nightmare juice! it's gone! somebody switched it for a beaker of grape kool-aid!!
have you called betty?  maybe you should.
fifteen. you don't know him. he was very kind and strong.
how long's he staying for?
you're kidding, right?
i'm not ulo and i won't slow down. but you will listen to me!
oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
leon! what in heaven's name...!
...the thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing dickie home. naturally, i hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
i think you're wrong, david.  she looks as fine as she's ever looked. worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
so how do you get from the bronx to the south china sea?
i explained this.  i can't.  that's not the way it happens.
so... smell... is... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  and a memory can trigger a smell.
hello, sweetheart.
yes sir.
you've got a beautiful walk, bob.
what are you doing.
you've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- now, who can i insult?...  who do we owe money to?...  ambassador trentino!  how about him?
poison emergency.
we're working as hard as we can --
a fucking wheelchair?
uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
it's a refund ... i'm afraid there was a mistake.
the people. when they pay him homage, he adores them. but when they have the ... audacity to question him. to doubt him. to embarrass him. then he despises them.
i can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. and there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  but there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  we just have to mobilize it.
you think that's funny
guys, i don't mean to be rude, but i only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
how do you know i made it up?
son?
is there only one charles lampert?
gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
okay, i'll do a damned lot count!
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
a little incestuous, but at least it's original. who's the guy in the halloween costume?
...personally i think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...naturally, i intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure i'm aware of the risks--why else do you think i would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
turn on your right side.  how about the other "right?"  i don't understand you philosphers. you've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
none of that's true?
news travels fast on broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
what about him?
there's a part of you i really like, but i can't do this anymore.  i just can't.  this is killing me...
paracelsus?
can i have your name again?
you get wise to <u>yourself</u>! if you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. everybody's entitled to one mistake--well--you're mine. when the going got too rough, i pulled up stakes and quit. we stay quit!--get that!--and what're you going to do about it?
good evening ... can we pass?
you would still have planted information that clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  very neat.  good morning, mrs. west.
for being a friend when i needed one. i hope our paths cross again.
chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. and i got way too many of them...
tyrone, what if i said i didn't want meatball today?
no, she just left. i'm surprised you didn't run into her. she went over to mr. norton's house.
oh god. we. liz. we. we. killed a woman. we...
okay, okay, fran. i deserve that. but just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, fran -- i've stopped running.
faisil.  you're new on harry's team, aren't you?
the young man, mr. davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
marty. what's for breakfast?
yo, paulie.
rats...
freeze!
what kind of person is that?
uh, yes... sure, david.
i was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
possibly.
the case..with the stones... where is it?
uhhhh...
practice ran late. i'm on my way.
i won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  never again...never....
where are all the mediums?

good thing one of us was prepared.
what about your agent? hear anything yet?
give me that!
okay. so what? stop worrying. i've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades? and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
ooh, now, see, if i'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, i'da done this different.  let's start over.  my name's george.  what's yours?
remember, pay attention to how she talks about foley, her tone.  do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell burdon.  tell her you think he's a nice guy.  no, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  if she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  i bet nothing.  so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  you think that's possible?  what kind of guy is he?
maybe you'll understand this, because you know john, but he confuses me sometimes.
if there ever was a devil in this county, ike, you is it!
isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
"march 7th - glen asked me to sleep with him again.  i can't yet - i like him, i want to make him happy but i'm not sure that i love him. i can't sleep with someone i don't love."
mommy's sick, guys.

stop --
roger, enough with the fucking donuts! what did i tell you. stop bothering mickey, and get behind your nagra.
where we going?
up an' at 'em, taber.
a little gut check time fellas. a time for some serious self-exploration. how do i function? for real? no more bullshit. can i keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? when they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. do you get me? do you get me?
it's my wife.
worse than cairo?							*
dammit, radar, wait till i call you! tell major burns...
well, you know what they say, "smile and the world smiles with you."  heh, heh.  the man should be in a straight jacket.  feeling better?
if i gave you any thought, i probably would.
i don't like this, this...
you will die! it will be awful!
the duke is to be addresses as... -- kynes comes forward and adjusts the duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
my girl back home. we're supposed to get married after i get my wings. she was tommy's girl. they were engaged to be married before he died.  i should've told you about her. i don't know why i didn't, except i didn't want you to think i was a shit for making it with lynette.
not that tie with that coat.
join up with you! i watched you, roy, i've been watching you, wondering if i should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
so the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, i'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, i just don't see the point.
where's everybody else?
aha! -- the baron. what do you want here?
i want to work this.

... i was dreaming ...
father.  you sure she's the supreme being?
you want somethin'?
okay... twenty dollars... when can you...
aye, sir; thrusters...
what the hell is this marvosa!!
i reckon not.
two guys?
even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
killing her won't solve anything.
you see, it is completely out of the question.
not necessarily.
teddy? would you please please please take me to the prom?
it would matter to us.
......delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her third vision hasn't happened. niwetükame, the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. tension. cowgirl tension! what a drag.
i can take care of the paperwork.
i say we off-load some of that gold now.
a thousand dollars ... and it's on all night?
the way this has gone till now, i wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.

you media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
right on the button.
they don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
as do i.
reluctant to speak, eh, chauncey? well, i can understand that. when a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. just give it some thought, work with the idea, i'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.

come on, julie. don't screw up. you have some real talent.
and when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
the connection is, it did a head number on him. he's petrified of cars. won't drive. i've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. he rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. the man that shot leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
how long do we have to watch him?
this is wrong in so many ways.
is this some kind of mugging? because...
it had this red spot on its back.
if i tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
even my own wife, chief,  who's wondering where i am?

aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  so...

uhura, hailing frequencies. right standard rudder, bring us alongside...

pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
i love you.

i got your bail continued.
i don't want to see them, kathryn.
thank you.  it's in remission now, thank the lord, but you never know.  and then while that's going on, i end up having to have a hysterectomy.  plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  all benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.

of course.  he's a "de-gene-erate".  he works at gattaca.  why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
i understand why you did that.
to my stomach.
what does that mean?

so, do we go on?
come on, what were you going to say?
how many men does cornwallis have under his command?
i know.
how was school today?
so that means it's alright for you to act like that?
all i know is, ever since "glen or glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
the village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost sankara stones...
they look like plain old rocks.
having two pints in the rock.
so you're a writer?
this little brother was terribly sweet. when he died, my mother was so sad. a lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. he will come back to you, you will see. so, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.

it's e-vit-able.
ooooooh.  hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. i've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. yes. that's the smartest thing you ever did, westley, not to contest that annulment. that's satisfactory, isn't it? yeah. well, it ought to be. oh i'm not complaining. it was dirt cheap.  don't fall out of any windows.
mmm, i could tell.
so he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
i guess what i'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan?
funny...
i'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
i hear you've got marjorie hargrove working for you now.
good.  now there is a window.  open it.
that's an extremely negative response.
avalanche season is coming.
dr. lizardo's a raving lunatic, perfect tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
i will close.
and i'm perk. short for percy, i'm afraid.
madame's doctor.  she has moments of melancholy.  there have been some suicide attempts.

okey-dokey, go ahead.
hello?
that shelter was in this bill.
...sorry...
you could have told me any time you were jacqueline's husband.
we had the greatest afternoon of my life until adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
...huh?
she didn't know what she was doing. you're too sensitive.
so what'll you do if i feel nervous? you'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
lots of places.  the tours, the clubs, the silicone shows, private parties.
you pull up -- collect your first installment.  then you let the daughter go.  when she reaches me, i'll dump out another third.  same action.  i back up again -- you pull forward.  satisfy yourself it's there.  then we do it one last time.  the final exchange. and we go our separate ways.
uh-huh.
yes.  i shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  i will blanket the city in endless winter. first gotham and then the world.
mike's our attorney general down here.  i was just explaining to jeff, they got a kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
on his day off. get the exact address.
in simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
take 'em.
he -- loves you.
we'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
we know that.
you know i can't.
and thanks for the cloak invisible!
thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that i really think i could have been something ... special.
i could have been better!
don't be an asshole. somebody has to stay with the store.
i give you my soul...
never a pair. i have never had a pair.
it's okay...it's okay baby. cry for mama. cry for mama.
some people are going out of here. what if i told you where and when?
face it. with some guys you have to make the first move. a lot of guys are just... wussies.
you've had a lot of bad luck these days. and yet -- it's all so unnecessary. when i think of your opportunities --
this business is over.
comment va-t-elle?
no one knows?
how much?
here comes daddy.
i'm going... i am... i'm going to be sick.

c'mon...
it's my graduation gift from daddy. it cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
thanks be to god.
hey jeff.
that's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
this is where we're going?
then that settles it, doesn't it?
hey, bubber, c'mere!  i gotta talk to you, buddy.
no more, lenny.
hi. mister kent.  guess who mom's having dinner with tonight? superman!
kevin, i'm telling you... it was like nothing i've...

you ever been in love?
calm down, my lord, i beg you!

back to san francisco.
yeah.  sociopaths.  they're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
i wish we did. you married?
he thinks he looks young.
no.  i'd seen him in there a few times before.  he was just a punk.  i'd never like danced with him or anything. anyway, he was a thief.  he must've taken it from the statue.
maybe it's legit.
you're sure going to be poison to that junior leaguer[4] from now on!
well.  that was brilliant.
slip out your m-16.
you knew her?
we're not doing it! i'm not even sure it's christian.
damnit...
long ago...

minimal damage to the scimitar.
no thanks. you go on.
we need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  hi.
hmm. how about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
okay.  then we go this way.
i'll talk to you later.
it was just a year, give or take a few days.  i mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  we had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  that spark, you know what i mean?  you gotta have that.
do any other daikinis ever come by here?
you don't have to get uppity with me, bill. i remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. and what was that other thing you tried? a dairy queen? went busted too.
i've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
i'm afraid she's going to walk.
i can't move my arm.
blow the goddamn hatch!
i lost it all.
this is day care.  it’s where babies go when their parents are at work.
none, it's mine - you said it earlier, i'm nuts.
what?
yeah? what about laura --
i'm sure you'd be great in henry james. but, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
walter, you fuck!
so. is it different to how you imagined it?
what do you want for dinner?
she would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
you moved like they moved.  i've never seen anyone move that fast.
no!  i got to find him.
the hell i can't!  we get in there and we can stop him.

i'll think you'll find our mr. bayliss is not keen on seafood. i've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
it is ibrim, i, i am a sorter.
good shooting, rafe!
who is it?
whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  the gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
did you have my home phone number?
yes.
what a nasty thing to say.
does he stay with you here?
and on halloween we could have a haunted house.  but a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  you know, more like the radio station ones.  this one would be really scary.  and for homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
hello austin. hello vanessa. this is basil exposition, from british intelligence.  there's a company in las vegas called virtucon that we think may be linked to dr. evil. many of the virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. that's the first place you should look.  well, i'm off to the chat rooms.
what?!
boy, are you gonna get it.
then make your choice.
how do you like flying?
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
nathanael, i'm sending you to virginia to head the southern army, to harass cornwallis.  marquis, you must go with him.
wait till you see her, auggie.
leave the zone? what would i do on earth?
y'think?
bravo!
what about you, doyle?  who's the best fighter you ever seen?
what was that?
i don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. next time, we'll design a bigger one.
well, i'm not entitled to a million dollars.  i... i... didn't expect... i didn't expect...
he didn't say nothin'. just drive.
[what is his name?]
i've been crazy about you for years. i've seen every picture you've ever made six times. i'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
nothing.
if we get with a counselor. at the church, maybe they's...
harold?
yeah, i'm over here with him.
this is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  now i won't have to come looking for you.
right, i'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
why don't we talk inside?
whatever you say...sis.
it's not just art, it's history. something you americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
i've had worse.
i know top dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
this is your last chance.
oliver's pet,  i'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
no.
i mean if he had the guts to knock mom cold once i bet she'd be happy and i bet she'd stop picking.  they make mush out of him.  just mush. one thing i know is i never want to be like him.
uh, er... i...
who's frieda?
see you in the fleet, sir!
with a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
i quit the movie.
bret... what the fuck...?
how the hell did you do that?
sounds like heavy artillery...
if you trusted me, you'd know.
because i was civil, now you're complaining.
don't you know the sort of thing that information retrieval does?
ah, what was that again, i still can't hear you?
what was?
easy, easy,  easy, scotty. easy. you're back with us.
he's queer too.  metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  on screen and off.  i'm getting him to fuck the d.a. for a hundred bucks.  that's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
will you do me one favor?
[the number you use at the bank machine.]
i never thought this would happen.  no premonitions, nothing.
what do you mean, next?
does this thing have guns, john parker?
this is no game.
what do you want, paula? what do you really want?
aw, hey...
then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
sickness comes to us all, mister dillon.
yeah, roz.
i hate to ask about a window.
tommy. he. doesn't mean anything. forget about it.
don't call him a dipshit.
you want a number for a psychiatrist, i can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
now since we've had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate, i wondered if you would be so kind.
you know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. you should have a record made of it.
we're all tired...
ok.
we got to go back.  we got to go back for wes.
we don't serve formula. snookums.
but you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
i, umm, came to see you.
something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to el paso, rudy?
hey, boss.  wondered where you'd gotten to.
commander?... where are you... going?
what i wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
so you're gonna leave it on. every night.  for a week.
how?  how were we the same people?
well i brought something, i wanted to show you.
how's my credit in this joint anyway?
you think i'm shitting you...
see you later, day-day.  come by after work, i got the john blaze shit for you.
then even if lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the fortress to rise near us.
didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
come on, relax...
do you have a girlfriend?
you kidding? i've been in and out of prison my entire life. mostly in. i'm hard-core.
who's he?
damn it!  chloramphenicol?
maybe mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  you know the old man doesn't want that.
why, what'd you hear?
mary had been there, one night, and had left.
finally, i get a waiter who doesn't know "macbeth".
i thought you were out of cigarettes.
that's pretty freudian, joe.
he's harmless.  back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley. i think he did too much lds.
i found something in my sleep. the friar who married them will take up their destinies.
of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
the fuck was that?
no, jane.
no, that's ignorant. they just don't know any better.
this.  above all.
well, honey, i sure hope it comes your way then.
aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
happy birthday.
heard grandpa santos and grandmama talkin'.
where did he go? he hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
so how are you doing, dad?
you sure you didn't see one of these?
woody, what are you doing under the bed?
touchy.
"surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
it's all right.
before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
i don't drive cross country.
i don't need the money.
yes.
hi.
oh hell.
god, that's fine.
good morning, mr. parrish.
certainly, if you insist. you must have quite a find there.
ah -- no.  it's fine.
daddy!
i want you to help me, fredo.
what the hell for?
anything the matter?
but otherwise it's swell.
so tell me about the times article.
come on sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  this is not a personal thing, this is business.
what did you do to your hair?
well, why not? the captain on a ship can. it doesn't seem fair that... hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
thank you for thinking of me.  anything else i can get while i'm in town? any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? would you like a tiny tape recorder? or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
what are you doing in here?
oh. i almost forgot. there is one last thing: before q retired, he asked that i give you one other protective device.
i can't enjoy anything unless i... unless everybody is. i-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, i-i... it puts a crimp in my evening.  so wanna get married or what?
you deaf or what?
i'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
you comin' in to hold my hand?
i cannot offer you the land, only my love...
elmer's glue?
did you notice -- no cane?
you never have any faith in my plans.  you always undercut my enthusiasm.
want to get a drink?
dear god.  where are we, lieutenant?
you're welcome to my little nest, joseph -- is it not? that's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
hey there.
nunez was chasing dunbar.
sweet jack.  i'm so sorry you found me asleep.  don't know what came over me.
the old man's screwy!
morning, sheriff.
no!
you'll see her die, that's all. they're mortal, despite what she told you.  she will die.  then what will you do?
but i told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. so don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
where's ebby?
mr.  flavors -- may i have a moment of your time?
and another thing.  stop with this spaceman thing.  it's getting on my nerves.
yeah, hello. how are you?
recognizable!  in that?
what's he like?
that for us?
i may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! mister o'connell but i'm proud of what i am.
mom!
they arrived.
just like that?  these people ruined your life, bro.
yeah. but not any more.
it isn't brains. it's how you use them.
would you care for some water, conner?
you told him i was here and he wanted to know if i was beating you up.
boats.  all anyone talks about is the wind.  is it up, is it down.  i can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
the girl was off today.  hey, i didn't expect you to sit up front.  so, your lady live out here?
iggy pop is not dead. he toured last year. tommy went to see him.
yeah, i'm a nurse's aide at mercy.
what?
that girl looks just like my old girlfriend gina.
what are you so scared of?
no, you don't understand -- i don't want to get out!  i want to get in?
-- no -- marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
zach, my boy ! how is tonights adventure going ?
you personally?
there were rats, dad.
don't worry.  i'll bring him in unharmed.
if i asked you to, would you? not on tape, i mean?
and did you?
the real story is that my mother was a hippie. and a stripper. she was insanely inappropriate with me. she used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. while i was still in the bath.
did you go home and get it?
and like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
this is so typical. i can't believe you. i've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? are you out of your mind?
carl somethin'?
you got yourself a computer, alma.
thanks  oh, did you send that telegram to jim mason?
wyatt, i... i ain't got the words.
that's cute, kathryn.  real cute.
have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
gonna need it. that boy is dangerous. fletch?
you’d better get going. my parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
what on earth?
it can.  i know the way.
no, i asked you to give me a refreshing drink. i wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
oh yes.
you're thinking with your gun, seamus, and not your head...
well, just, you know, have 'em call me. y-you know where to find me, right?
okay.
i dunno.
i'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. it's funny, but somehow, i feel like....like i know you.
sure did.
goddamn it, alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! how much longer before he's slappin' you around? punchin' you in the stomach? how the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
they've been on to you all along. knew you had a big job going.
brian. what's wrong?
you should try xanax. i mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. like insurance.
oh no... no you don't.
there's sometimes a buggy. how many drivers does a buggy have?
tell me about doctor paley?
neil, it's no use.  you saw how he is.
he goes to my father's church. he could've died --
his only copy.  i mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? and so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
what?
surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
who are you?
mookie!  how is anybody gonna call in?
this is certainly... ah...
what's wrong with you?
great to get away, take it easy. next week, i'll get back to work.
i haven't yet.  i don't have much of a case.
darling.
you're going after her in that? you're crazy...it'll take all day in that bathtub....
why would i be pissed?
we're on.
what's wrong?
no music.
please -- oh, no -- please!
alright, now tell me. what is it?
why didn't you finish this game?
no i didn't know you had one.
what's that you say?
well, you know where the lavatory is.  you pay for that pee stick when you're done! don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
what do i do?
who are you, anyway?  i don't even know you.
the license!  you get it?!
why?
money?  well, i'm glad to hear somebody admit it. do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
why her?
we got what we wanted.  that's <u>enough</u>.
how was the game, honey?
it wasn't a lie.
how old are you?
how are you feeling, norman?
tell me again.
parker barnes, i'd like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane.
i loved you ellen - why did you do this?
do i hear a motion seconded?
the camerawork's nice.
jesus christ.
take me away from here?
you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
tell mrs. mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. then if i don't show, take her down to the boat.
yesterday.
watch out!!
no, thanks.  i'll just look around.
tell us about him.
i ain't sure.
two brothers, prospectors, lived here. up until a few years back.
what'd you put him in there for?
buffy, what are you doing here?
madame bougival; mademoiselle clairwil -- and of course -- the marquis' wife --
they keep him confined? that's bullshit!
we'll go in through that large breach.
do i drive? uh, no, i gotta-i gotta problem with driving.
yeah, i swiped it from ms. rancick.
dan'l webster?
i know, i ...
strip reality! how do you play that?
he must've beaten us all here!
prison was horrible but it was his home.  he's been torn from it by strangers.  he's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
hey! we decide something, that's it! we're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. we've got to think --
...will there be somethin' else?
*screw* you--jesus! take it to a lawyer! no, i insist! this is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! i must say, i've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and i've never--
well that's what hospice will take care of for you.  they will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
hey!
you tricked me, damn you!
i'm going to the show.
will you accompany me to the bridge?
three hours.
hey, wait a minute!  that's all our food supplies in there!  we can't pump poison gas all over them!
uh-huh. so what are you doing here?
if i can help you ...
now you're talkin'. gee whiz, i could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. how much does this cost?
i don't know.
she's not gonna die.
i feel great i got no sleep but i feel like orlando furioso!
éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  we have to clear out.  railroad station? ticket office, please.
so you're on your way to tir asleen, huh?  i hate to tell you this, willow, but tir asleen dosn't exist.
god, that smoke's poisonous!
who's the new side of beef in tran's posse?
yes, sir.
you know what i've been doing since i got home? been working on a poem.  it's about you.  sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so i write 'em.
oh, it's okay, then.  'cause you're just taking out the garbage...
don't.
don't make no difference no more.
it's a very good year.
yes, sir.  won't find a better cqc on the market.
...uh-huh.
he vowed that if the assembly votes a single shilling to lee, he'll dissolve the body.
he says wednesday at three o'clock at the beverly wilshire. he wants everybody there.  he'll talk to you. if after talkin' to you he's convinced you're ok, he'll do business. if not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. he also wants a sample bag.
because i'm in love with you.
you're not telling me something.
triplets.
he'll come down. leave him alone.
shit.
of course.
holy fucking shit!
i said let's go.
we're going to be right over here.
we could co-write a paper.
do you remember this?
no question, no, you're right. we gotta do what's good for us now.
don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
there's more...
so why the long face?
could you stop, please.  you're giving me a headache.
frida. i was looking for you. you changing jobs?
just look at this tie. you could fry an egg off that orange, yow. have you ever considered the jerry garcia line of ties ?
i'm sorry but there's no record of a jacob singer in our files.
are you serious?
crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
he'll, what else can i do with it all?
if i told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much i can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
"it is my home."
and he is living proof.
'preciate it. claude.
can i go?
oh, how inappropriate is that!
it's a sign --
because i am holding all the western territories hostage, mr. west!  a town a day will disappear!  willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  next, i level all of albuquerque!  yes, that's right.  only yesterday i learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own president will be there.  what an added bonus! the gods are shining on me!  after tomorrow every american citizen will rise up and demand i be given back my humble little empire!
no...i was hoping to get a kiss.
should i just ask your girlfriend?  maybe i should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
or a cover up!  jesus, bill, don't you have enough proof of the fbi's complicity now?
so to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
this is lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. we were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? we're gonna go and eat, let's go.
there's so much i want to tell you. i'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. it's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. it's opening me to a death.
my god.
the country boy's about due.
bring me something simple. i never think about food.
yeah... mmmm, that sounds good... uhu...
nilsen?
what?!
oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
rizzo, pull away!
alpine grove still exists. i looked it up on the net. we should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
what?
me?
what happens if you lose?
that's got nothing to do with it!
yeah.
that's one idea.
i mean, screw them, you know?  i'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
then what is it?
give us your money, kid.
what's your problem with crippled dick?
divorced.
his secretary just confirmed.
barbie from hell...
no, alex. it's, it's --
harry, i heard collins has you in some kind of special class.
and so do i!
my name is carpenter and i'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
what do other guys do?
no children?
where is the key?
what's that mean?!
mitch ryder and the detroit wheels?
so what's in there -- ?
good... it looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so i think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
a donny chiba triple feature. "the streetfighter", "return of the streetfighter", and "sister streetfighter".
i'm up against a deadline.
well, that's not gonna happen.
he says their medicine is that much more advanced.  he was very nice about it. but he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
captain, i hope i don't have to remind you --
i can't remember offhand, lieutenant.  maybe i was over at charlie's shooting pool. maybe i was here.  she'd remember.
she's just a kid. there's time for more babies later. after she grows up.
that silberman just crack me up.  he had this guy in here last week who set his afghan on fire. screwed it first, then set it on--
there wasn't a fire.  there'll be nothing for you to do.
send him in.
he wets the bed?
i think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  let me know what you find out.
no.
oh dear, i feel like doing a bit of work.
where is she?
well, i'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. you make me sick. you're a hypocrite and i don't associate with hypocrites.
you're picking up my lingo, hon.
that isn't magic.
on the count of three!  one ... two ...
i am.  with you.
nice to meet you, wally.
i thought that's what you said. you're from cleveland. and you were with the thirty-sixth bomb group?
i'll relay it. you sure you don't wanna go home?
what's this? what's this? god damn bullshit. bullshit. don't put those --
what?
y'mean frame him?
that will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
iím sorry...
all very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in new york for jacqueline's voice?
it was bad.
i don't know.  when i was in college, i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
what is it?
it does, doesn't it?
up here on the fifteenth floor?
you're not gibarian...
i never thought i'd ask this of anyone, andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
...i guess i'm sprouting off again. but i am certain of this, garland: i'm capable of more good work. maybe better work than i did in choirs. it just doesn't seem to me that los angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
you made a mistake.
you mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
yes.
everything?
i'm getting used to it. where are we?
i can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation i'm in, i don't -- avi: you know what?  being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? now solomon, let me just ask you once: please. please. don't do this.
you should... mind it.
hello mr. kastle.  junior, long time. i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
might be a good time to try using it again.
ichabod...
bathroom?
you crave what i might show you.  what you can learn.  what i can give you.  so much more than michael can.
yeah.
yeah, but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
n-no, sir?
a. slushee. don't tell me.  abraham slushee. third president of the united states.
in maine?
what're you saying?  that we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
exactly 15.5 seconds.
i love you very much, my dear.
what are you going to do?
sure.
i make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  the guy is the stripe combo, i know him too.
let me give you some useful information, son. there's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. however you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
no...
jesus.  what, i live in a palace, right?  i have guests here.
you okay?
i know that, dad, but --
lois, i've got to hand it to you. you're amazing. who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the caribbean?
it's 1945. it's a different world now.
bullshit.  fifteen years, frank. no one paid us off.
a few years ago, the army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. he even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming basic cadets across the country.
i'm helen tasker.  harry's my husband.  and you are?
i'm a little busy right now --
i'm so sorry, i didn't notice much.
i was just wondering... nick... you're going hunting... if i could use this place to stay, because...
positive.
i noticed.
so do i.  as a matter of fact, i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music.
as in <u>catcher in the rye</u>?
float me a hundred bucks.
i'm so hungry.
stay in the light! everybody! stay in the fucking --
what do you think, eightball?
you are not a loser.
okay... ghandi.
okay.  let me call around.  i'll see what i can do.  don't go anywhere, okay?
well, we didn't get any help on that. a lot of people saw it. nobody's talking.
you really think there's a treasure inside?
you think you could do this like soon? it's almost six thirty.
you bastard --
valet?  you jest of course.  i am a u.s. marshal.
you are a travel agent, aren't you?  "doris"?  your job is to help people travel.
fair enough. no pressure here, barton, because i respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. one, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
no. maybe. i don't know. i don't know what i'm going to do.
i would like to know the contents. every detail is important.
can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
what's the matter, sweet pea. foley finally starting to get to you?
no... a little. there's a lot of debate about it.
i have helm control.
it relaxes me.
she's taking singing lessons.
what'd you say?
do you still have to do homework?
where ya goin?
samhain.
a change of plans?
what do you take me for? it's a navy cross.
you got a place to stay?
well i ain't one of 'em!
shit, nothing but paper panthers.
how many with you?
just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
well, i do, and she's fantastic. she'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  you're going to have a fantastic time.
jack, she's a fucking waitress in buellton. how would that ever work?
honor, i suppose.
why?
all day since you and betty left. brother minister, i have to level with you. they gave me a mission. but i couldn't do it. i love y'all.
does my skin feel soft, anthony?
forget it, ma. i got her figgered out. long as i keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. all i gotta do is keep my nose clean.
what's wrong with this one?
right!
hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  this one is putting out low bits.  the data is in some fucked binary system.  the two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  comprendo?
out!!!!
they didn't get the contracts.
-- or 'you're our kind of people --'
perhaps you are the kwisatz haderach.
that's the same guy who did this painting.
*you* find out, i can't.
happen to know where there's one for sale.
are you still here?
what's that idiot doing next door?  we use your van. it's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. plank is going up first. there is a cage but it is never locked, is it plank?
air lock?
... the old man is getting weaker, chance.
i didn’t know my husband and friedman knew each other. i just...  do you think we spoke about it? i’ve known for five years. he’s known i’ve known for five years... but not once have we spoken about it. there are things one just doesn’t speak about...
how many?
so? the man got silver, china, rugs --
if i tell you, then it's no fun.
it's the bitterest of pills.
i don't think that's how i would describe him.
he may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
no, no. i did.
no, man. i need to use the phone.
so, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
from a chicken, bug-wit.
gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
... what i'm curious about are the wilderness years.  you're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  it must have taken tremendous faith.
there is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
that's what i'd like to know.  she stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
i was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
don't say that.  i had a marriage of convenience with grace, and look where that's lead.  well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
to my own special sissy. cheers! and welcome. so my letter brought ya flying, eh? where were you? salt lake city? la conner? well, i may have a little surprise for you. but first, tell me about yourself. it's been six months, hasn't it? in some circles that's half a year. how are you?
you and i -- a relationship.
i figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
it ain't here.
there's no need for any of this. your condition can be treated. whistler and i were working on a cure when --
okay, in a minute, i'm on with a client.
you go out... with friends?
go to lunch, george.
we shall attack at once.
how'd it go?
miller.  thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  really didn't expect to lose him.
don't be so humble.
that’s right. imagine facing it alone.
what the hell happened?
well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
tell him to put his gun down!
i do not understand.
that's because most of it never happened.
pretty.  she's a blond.
he's going with me. you take crabtree. and his friend. all right?
you're wrong, george.
why?
meet me later.  milkshakes.  cherry pie. banana splits.  and no mom!
what?
frances farmer, contract player, six- month option.
then shoot him already.
that night you wanted to talk about your dad i had a curfew.  what was i supposed to do?
six or eight.  and they go wild?
how long were you hooked?
anything special about the case?
there's got to be a way out of this place.
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? it's not original. it's something i picked up from the chink.
he has a computer?
it's a --
what's going on terrance?
but that's simply not possible. and i don't find this funny anymore.
last night never happened, you hear me? i'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and i are gonna take this to our coffins!
...but damn man... this better go smooth.
it was my fucking television.
you really do have those thoughts, don't you?
you need to believe in something besides yourself.
walter!
they know you are tutsi!
christ!  i didn't say you were out of the game!
oh, he was. he told me a magic spell that would make you come.
go back to sleep, baby.
have you ever heard of someone named lisa sherman?
don't be silly.
i'm a scientist.  i have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if i were you, i'd give it to him.
high line whores.  with plastic surgery to look like movie stars. and who knows what else?  it's run by this guy pierce patchett.  you want to talk to him?
kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
why?
well, it is. it is that, too.
i expect to hear from you soon. if huey newton takes a crap, i want to know how big it was. otherwise i'm gonna come looking for you. and i won't be as "friendly" as today.
will you meet with him?
what's wrong, lou?
ready?  what is it?
did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
thanks, pollux.
hands on the wheel.  ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
thanks....
okay.
i was only checkin' it for you. thought maybe somethin' was bent.
forgive me father.
what now?  where is she?
i am beginning to know mr. nehru.
thanks.  it was my idea.
they checked in.
what?! good lord no, it's just... it's money. we needed backing and... well, we found it.
i have to, tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
... are you waiting for someone? an appointment?
don't you believe it, rose. don't!
there must be a quarter-million out there, edgar.  they've been at it now for a year.  young kids just like tricia.  i don't know.  do you think they have a point, edgar?  maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
he's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
absolutely.
thank-q!
you like patsy cline?  i just love her.  how come, i wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
and, if it's a threat.
jeebs is eager to have me deport him. but would rather kill himself than go downtown. why?
someday she'll thank you.
accident, and yeah, i got to be more careful.
i've seen worse places.
what is it?
get out of the car, spread them. you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! you commie motherfucker. either way you're goin' to the can.
what about the allies? congress? i think we may need to start letting key people know. and they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. we're going to need to get the u.n. staff in and warmed up. jesus... i don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
i don't know.
i'm sorry it is not glenmorangie.
hey, what the hell you doing?
debra, you're fuckin' insane.
that means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
ro - you can't really believe that. nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  i mean --- that's crazy.
you don't have to do this. i can look after myself.
oh!
not before i settle with you, chickenshit!
well, yes.
thank you, kind sir.
yeah, we talked about sex, too. oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
it's not?
no, faith.  they came out of somebody's imagination.
i wonder if that's his doctor.
something's wrong.
i'll tell you who you are.  you're the glue.  you're the thing that holds everybody around you together. you're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  it's a gift.
spunk, come back...
benjamin -- i want you to know i'm available to you. if you won't sleep with me this time --
you make it sound i pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
very impressive resume.  electronic countermeasures, strategic air command ... black belt in karate ... small arms expert ... mr. zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
how... how ya doin', farmer?
i don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. if i can't be safe among my own kind, where can i be? allah will protect me.
what do you want me to do?
i never knew hildy to be so determined before.
sal maguda.
jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining pi.
yeah. it's close by, that's what's creepy. they've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except i don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
there's nothing to be done about it.
who was that?
you aren't taking me for granted, are you?
how is that possible?
are you freaking out?
chi?
what makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, dude.
lucas and his romper room stage.
look at this street.  all card- board, all hollow, all phoney. all done with mirrors.  i like it better than any street in the world.  maybe because i used to play here when i was a kid.
jennifer --
you want me to come with?
luciano is dead?
great, sir. great.
o, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. they pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
hey.  thanks, buddy.
if you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
since when did he drink whisky?
i was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at watergate?
emily!
except for the last part, that one's not bad.
yeah, better run, you bastards!
promise.
just a place, i suppose... who knows?
pleasure to meet you.  i've seen you on television.
so what is it, jack? what brings you up here?
about two years ago.
to celebrate misery's return. i couldn't have done it without you.
i better not come in.
oh. that's, uh, my room. vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
may i ask how much your rooms are?
just keep him quiet.
i thought you'd be off on tour, playing london, paris, new york?
i'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
jack - - please - - wipe that lunatic grin off your face.
all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave. by my hand.
tell me what she looks like.
vinkel...you've got quite a collection of er-collection.
i'm great.  i mean, i know i'm not really great, but i feel just great.  how you like my new suit?
shh. come on, it's gonna be ok.
i shouldn't have let him go.
how's it going chef?
you know more than the doctor? you're not okay, look at you.  come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
sweetheart....
you too.
well, i'm sorry.
you want to come splash around.
i must go.
why?
any court in the land would understand. we'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
he's a good pilot.
yeh, sleepin'.
are you talking to me?
cooch. what's the fort laramie treaty?
gents, we are in the middle of something here.
exclusive? that's great.
life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. you must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. you gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but i -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
my name is gina!
francesca.
that's what everybody says.
pop, there's no way an ivy league team is going all the way.
well, there he sits.  it's not supposed to make sense.
yeah, i guess.
the gentleman who came to the door --
i— i never knew a girl like you, edie. i always knew the kind you just grab 'em and— i never knew a girl like you, edie.
how do you send out an apb on a dead man?
ok, goddamnit!... look... i'll call her. i'll get her off our backs. you're right. she's my problem.
yeah.  i guess so.
you shouldn't tell me that now. after all these years!  i put all your things in here. go in, go in...
er, alive? he couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
you're one tough cookie, trevor gooding. you keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
what can i do for you, mr. kirby?
oh, thank you very much.
hello?
oh, it's you.  it's only peter.
what do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
taking the book along?
when we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  now she's just hostile.
hey, professor tripp.
what is it with crack and transsexuals?
that's the third time he's called today.
everybody's a big shot.  well, leo, are you having a good time?
dimmy, you worry for something?
you're nothing but a... a...
fuck.
<u>my dog</u>.  one i intend to put to sleep.  extrapolate from there.
oh hell yeah. we's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. so don't feel so bad dude.
call me.
the partridge family?
goodbye, charlie.
goodness, no!
welcome?
the question is, who are you? you are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. elijah muhammad can bring you into the light.
let's have a contest. now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. but anyone can join in.
supposing we could get out of this room?  is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
you're cheating on george? jennifer, how could you?
reliant's command...
it would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "newswoman saves suicide?"
. . . er, this john doe idea is yours, huh?
yes.
theo, buzz is dead.
the obliterators!
do you know what he's been saying to her?
now what.  you gonna take your new arsenal, go visit terry valentine, just like that?  boom bam boom.
why don't you get rid of him and get yourself straight dealer?
i am, too.
what is going on...?!
what happened to emma will never go away.  it's part of you now and it always will be.  but you have to learn to live with it...
i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that i can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with caitlin.
jack.
my, oh my, jimmy, how gallant.
the creature?
gatorade.
boys, boys...
but this woman -- and her son --
no.
i think it's time we got some professional help.
and the police did nothing?
yeah.
i know what i'm doing and i know why i'm here!
what did i do?
and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
i'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. i'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. that, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
kiss your ass goodbye, reinhardt.
you're right.  thanks for the drink.
i don't get it.
there are thirty five listed in the reverend wong's roster...
well... you could always dump her, mr. bebe. teach her a lesson. there are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
dick... and my mother! she acts like she's on mars or something --
shit!  forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  you know, at one time i even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  and then i lost that. that fuckin' clay shaw.  i hate the bastard.  all i got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  he tipped the newspapers - i know it.  that's how the agency works.  they use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  now it's my turn.
i understand. i saw the dress. i...i'm sorry.   are you all right?
where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
well who did?
of course!
what is it?
...this way.
right now?
hi.
come on, stand still.
yes.
that one.
malcolm's okay for now.  i gave him a shot of morphine.
i don't know.
we're over our heads. mr. sulu, get us out of here.
thank you.  you still think that he was....
pardon?
gee, i don't know, crabs. i don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
not that far, only halfway.  you sure you know what you're doing?
that is correct.
happened...yes happened right down there.
you want me to go in there?
allah be praised. and what battalions will you call upon?
no, no, i want to. i'll just go into the village.
well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, i just got a letter!
i need the money.
nah.
she's been there since thursday night.
what if it's a valloro 69?  just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
you like my play.
well, i don't have any money . . .
you're joking.
wait, wait. don't hang up.
this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. you gotta ask yourself just one question. are you feelin' lucky?
walter! d-did you see --  -- that?
i'll help you. to begin with, you'd like to know what i'm doing here. whether i was born here.
hey -- what about dorothy?
i mean, do you have something i could show my manager? i mean, do you have a reel?
he's getting married... and we're nuts!
what was that you said about a pet shop?
at christmas. to cortina with freddie miles and --
first time?
arachtoid.
no, no, you did fine.  i'd even say well done.  besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
rob.  top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the '80's and '90's.  subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
what lesson do get outta that story, lula?
then you can learn to act normally. i had to!
this is dangerous shit, dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
that's better. i say, isn't this where you came in? it's impenetrable, by the way ...
you cook very well!
well...i don't know.
i'm the sufi.
butch called.
i haven't got that much in cash.
morning, boys.  ready for a walking tour?
why not?
see you tomorrow —-
negroes would be in an uproar.
the man in the garden.  he was full of courage.
i'm trying to help you.
i'm not a scholar, dottore.  but it seemed as if they, as if they...
you see, rose? now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
what?
no.
i've had this feeling -- ever since i've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that i have to be rude all the time. do you know what i mean?
well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
this is natural.
i want to know you.
he's just playing, q...
good.  perfect.  i'll be in new york with walter, i can squeeze it in.
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so i knew i'd be on time.
you're serious?  you'd help me...
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, john!
i'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and i'm gonna find out what for. there's a real story, smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did i tell ya?!
sure.
then who operated the store?
this is my home.
what do you mean -- not normal?
you just feel sorry for me.
i'd have liked to have said goodbye.
we just missed the turnoff to the party.
i called your agent.  i called the screen writers guild.  finally your old apartment gave me some crestview number.  there was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  you were not there.  you were not to be spoken to.  they never heard of you.
we blacked our hands and faces.  at midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  the name of the village was mhravitch. remember that name!
like what?
neil, how are you gonna do this?
i know a little. i studied it in my youth.
i could have ended it tonight, but i didn't.
phone number.
hm?
who can i say is calling?
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what i knew and what i did with regard to the watergate break-in and cover-up were just as i have described them to you from the very beginning ...
when did you get out of jail?
no.
if you don't mind, mam, i'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
elena, it's not what you think. it's not a big plot. honestly. honestly. i don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. i don't feel good about it. i know i've done what i didn't want to do. i don't know --
you can do that?
i'm just tryin' to figure it out.
"cotton".
it's the same thing!
we gotta be inconspicuous.  do you know what that means?
but this is...
as long as it's on their terms. if your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
man, somebody really hung one on you!  i've heard some good ones for you guys... humphrey bogart, harley davidson.  i guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. you weren't at the back of the line, were you, george?
ah... he certainly has something, sir.
and?
i.r.a. device. deadliest class of tickers in existence. computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. first showed up in a series of i.r.a. bombings in london couple years ago. one of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. the girl, is she irish?
uh, oh. now it's time.
we're having a party for you, boy. cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. junior cringes away from the light.
somebody get her a mike? can we manage that?  and a spotlight.  what's your name?
that would have been quite a coincidence.
what?
do i have to raise me voice?
what's the matter?  upset that i rubbed off on her?
i can't.  the voice man is coming to get me.
is that the entire message?
let it go, claude.
and i thought it was something serious! how could you frighten me so?
do we just leave him there?
i wish there were something more i could do to help you.
i say we go over there and kick their asses.  i can take the little one.
i'm telling you he's dirt. he's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  honest to god, i don't know if i have the energy.  you know, i've been sick. me and peter both have.
this, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
how did it go?
i can't close 'em.
why don't you come down and get them so i can wring your pretty little neck?
as a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, i'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  twenty five percent.
a little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
your lambs are still for now, clarice, but not forever... you'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
all right people. new plan. not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
your daughter's life was just threatened!
al?
michael johnson.
you come up with a better plan, let me know.
aaaaaaah...my god...my god...i am heartily sorry...for having offended thee....offended thee...
well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people i would have to say it's a box.
do you remember the night i fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
hey, you guys, what's going on?
we're talking.
i got delayed. i --
got your light?
... okay, then, i have a confession to make.  i'm the batman.
be here. in case.
feel anything?
hi, it's me.  just who you wanted to talk to, right?
i thought of that, with the filters from the clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. after that, we'd better be on our way home.
you afraid of violence?
get out of the way.
but the place burned to the ground.
no, sir ...
oh no!
"her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
i'm fine.  really.  leia ... when i was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
do you like talk like that?
this car will take me to las vegas. i cannot go back.
uh-huh. you could’ve waited for me inside.
did he say anything about me - tell me?
it's ok --
but sir, what can i say to her? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
but what was a hair dresser from malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
i got time, bert.
do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
being with stephanie has opened my eyes. she's not uptight or controlling. she's just cool. things are so easy with her. smells different. tastes different. fucks different. fucks like an animal. i'm telling you, i went deep last night, miles. deep.
so don't show a picture.
i don't know what you're talking about.  what's happened?
turkish gecko, i believe.  a lizard.
i'm quite serious. look at all the charity and clinic work we do. up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
if i were you, sefton, i'd eat that egg some place else. like for instance under the barrack.
well i don't know -
hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
tina, what do you want me to do?
you're just saying that.
you're lying!
hey terry, what is that?  did peggy make it up?  i've never seen that on bandstand.
my father didn't want it incinerated.
a deer?
now he's here. he went in mr. grant.
do you have ulcers?
so he was indicted?
-- so when are you going to egypt?
lookit kip. all grown up...
i mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. i didn't mean to --
tough shit, bro. this ain't miami. you want something, talk to me.
what are you doing in new york...?
i'm sorry.
he wouldn't do that.
as i have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. you see, father --
i didn't ask him.  all i know is that i haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
excuse me sir. are you a guest of the club?
yeah.
we'll walk.  and if we have to, we'll starve.
we try something out. there's someone i'm in business with named ruiz. i want you to accompany him on a drop.  just as scenery. ruiz has his boys. i just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. as a deterrent.
--jeeeeeeesus--
he was a corrupt cop, verbal.
we could skip the gavotte.
i know you do, tom.  then i can count on you to help me do the things i have to do.  if not, call houstan, and become a vice-president. take your family and your mistress and move them to las vegas.
hello, again.
don't worry, james, i'll figure something out.
so...what was i...oh, yeah. do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable? that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
no.
to recover the mind set.
well, i-i-i didn't know what to say. first i said no, but then, he pressed it.  he said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
i don't know where you were, penis envy.
yeah, well, me too.
then just help me find a girlfriend! that's all i ask. i'll give you every single card i've got left!
i haven't seen you around here.
you down with the boost?
how could you be a part of this?
that information is classified. you're there to gather information on their operations, period.
i don't want anything to happen to you.  i care about you.
how will you fight apollo creed?
shut the fuck up, donny!  v.i. lenin! vladimir ilyich ulyanov!
of course i can.
c'mon, guys!  every christmas and birthday we go through this.
as for the author... shoot him.
it's a tachyon chamber.  it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  there are other worlds, daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
ed tom, i'll be polite.
now what?
but we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  are they a peace-loving country, major.
does this assignment interest you?
did you hear that click?
hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. don't cross words with me.
i don't see why not.
i've been disavowed.  they think i killed jim and everyone else.  somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  kittridge assumes i'm a mole they've been tracing and i've been in the employ of an arms dealer, max, for the last two years, to get him our noc list.
you've got something to show me.
put down lex luthor !
what i love.
our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
i know em, i don't know what order they come in...
...that’s our war room. we did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
all right then, if i have to go to school then i'd better go.
what?
what?
i kissed those girls.
you have to put things in perspective.
hi - carl denham. i'm a big admirer of your work, sir. i've loved all your discoveries. i really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. it'll be good for you and good for me.
murderers like you?
and it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
why?
er, very nice harry. what's it for?
i doubt that. i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
see, no one's here. maybe you want to go to the basement?
listen. i feel pretty strange here. because mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
it is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in new york, hollywood and london are no different from the good people of des moines, chillicothe and liverpool. by and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
you took him to the funeral, i hear.
what's the meaning of this?
you sure you outta be playin, around with that?
...no, i've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  maybe it's a personal pain. at any rate, i don't believe good work is possible without it.
children, i want you to be very good and very quiet while i see mrs. wheeler a moment. she's going to take over this class for a while.
i'm sorry.  it's just that i get so nervous before i travel.
i know this.
your door was unlocked.
yeah.  i'm probably ruining them.
ben -- i just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
they'll hang him all the same.
is your husband with you?
i know her uncle. friends of the family.
what do you say to that?
we definitely want it to have junk.
you bet you are.
dad, are we hit?!
and now you're throwing everything away? you're gonna be a nobody! nobody! you know what that's like?!
he's going to have you the rest of his life, hildy. can't you give me another hour?
i mean the other one!
you're tired of me. i can tell.
no. you can't. look, i know you don't know me from adam, but you've got to trust me.
we're from scientific american.  we read about your discovery.  we'd like to take a look.
that's a lie. my family was here.
you manifested that, beth.
<u>also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>uhr</u>.
i told you i can't, not yet.
guess what"s under these coconuts.
that farmer in gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and i'm beginning to see why.
angelo, pay attention.  there's gonna be a test afterward.  lab is showing traces of toxins.  pcbs. heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
it looks a bit fishy to me.
you're so proud.  you're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "look, dad, i got an f!"
lovely. how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali? zipping through my inheritance per usual?
the kid, yeah...
you know what it's like. it's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
it's places like this that make me certain there's a god.
you know - the old shell game.
that's right...
he was expecting you?
daddy?
sure wish i had longer to get used to the idea.  you think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
well... i mean like lula bein' in a family way.
boys like him have -- expectations.
do it, quickly.  please.  aim for the eye.
yes, he was.
all right.  since you put it that way.
i get why you're angry. it's no snap to explain why i was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
sorry, sorry, sorry. i know, i'm late, i'm a swine.
where are you going?
it's really a wretched morning... wretched. i can't get myself right. i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle. my face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can i dim myself down, leon? suggest something. i am so bored with this face. i wish i had someone else's face. whose face would you have if you had your choice? oh, well, i guess one gets the face one deserves.
he's a great doctor -- a great man --
what?
mr. duke? hello, mr. duke, i'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... i thought i should call again, because i was wondering...
i want to see lecktor now.
what are you doing?
i'm sorry, i think i'm checked in here, but i've misplaced my key.
i don't know, i think he's funny.
did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
what?
maybe we should call the coast guard.
hard to say.
peter, okay?
copy out from here...
do you see a man?
uh, uh.
can we buy the marshal some dinner?
you probably know the type. you find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. they always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. they dress and enamel themselves with great care. they worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. and they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like larry mitchell.  tell me about yourself, miss mayfield.
i'll stay. why don't you go home with josephine and i'll stay tonight.
there are important papers from --
and there's the sphinx.
a legendary monster called mbwun.
well... i can't think of anything.
your wheel, dude!  i'm rolling out!
john!
listen, patrizia... the marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... i don't know which... he wants to send one of his men over to have a look... one never knows... do you mind if i ask raimondo to go with him?
it'll be out later this year.
sounds smashing.  i'm in.  muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  now be serious.  you couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
i'll be a few minutes.  wait here --
now i pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. you got that?
good.  with any luck we'll run into each other.
yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
uh unh.  no way!  they'd crucify me.
two years.  george, i can't wait that long.
the thing is, sir, i've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of dr bean here - and we feel the time's come for whistler's mum to have her first face-lift.
i'm right here.  i'm fine.  what's the dog's name?
your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance saturday, she's available.
love to, sir, but no can do.  no spare room.  period.
look. that telegram was all scrambled. it was actually from thompson, not to him. western union must have gotten the names reversed. i have to get going. i have to get out to the track.
do you know leon’s parents names?
of course not.
maybe i won't have to. a bribe has worked before. in the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
it hasn't been easy, has it?
determine extent of damage, immediately.
and that makes you look like a squid?
i've been seeing johannsen in chemistry.
hell they don't. i met my first wife that way.
need a ride?
m-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... you can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big n.o.
it's not my father's money, it's the foundation's.  why did he think you had it?  and who does?
jack, are you really dead?
listen, angie, i wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. i introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. now, why did you do that?
well... it's possible they think my name's bobby.
but i can't leave with you.  i won't make it.
then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
christ!
you got money in this tub?
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
yeah, yeah.
this must be it.
if you're asking me if i'm passionate about what i do, the answer is yes. without passion, nothing moves us. what's your passion?
dude finlay?
what're you doin', baby?
how long before this car's hot?
what?!
i'm feelin' dis'!
very well put.
watch the show, sid. his basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
yeah, you know holden caulfield in the catcher in the rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
i'm scared i'm slipping back.
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  all the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
he stole my wheel!
did you hit him?
let me tell you something cooper! i never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
what the hell was that, another statement?
but, in particular?
i had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. then a drifter named deacon frost came calling one evening --
i've had enough family for one month, frank.
no.
yeah. i'm registered for this class.
what else is there for me? 
but maranzano's got the men and the brains.
no, bud, no... not you.
anytime.
they're all asking how you're doing. are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
i was just looking in an old annual and...
you're not thinking of telling her, are you?
then teach me how.
i'm baron von gaigern.
what is it, mary?
you--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
where you going?
shit!
they're bypassing engineering...
get that fucking thing away from me!
i'm not stepping anywhere --
so you got cozy with she who stings?
where'd the road go?
liza?
makes you gag.
who is to say our morals are better than hers?  but maybe you're right. she could... influence dolly...
but why?  it's <u>your</u> lunch. there isn't much there in the first place.
it's just a name.
he lives on 76th?
i want to tell eve.
so no funny stuff.  okay?
i can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, i think about back home, back home at malibu. i used to surf a lot, talby. i used to be a great surfer.
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
i understand.
hey, where's finch?
oh... i guess i'll die now.
show me.
didn't you recognize him, dopey. that's old man doyle.
quit screwing around, this is important.
maybe because you're shot in the leg.
are you nuts?  they'll fry us for sure.  there's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  no way.
bastards! come back here and face me!
he's a riot.
i don't care <u>what</u> you say! in constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
oh, uh... they were a present from dana.
no, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
bye.
tell him, harold.
...so maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in brainerd.
totally. i'm fine. you want a beer, man -- ?
go ahead and laugh, you know what i mean. what a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. they got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
i'm walter peck.  i represent the environmental protection agency, third district.
well, i go to a psychic and she's always telling me i'm psychic. she should know. do you believe in that stuff?
let's get outta here.
he is!
manray!
to protect. to serve you. chairman mao wants you to feel that china belongs to you now.
was it a sudden quarrel?  had there been any trouble between you before?
what have you done?  you've gotten the old man fired!
alive or dead?
i was an fo for the 25th.
ya know harry, i think this whole experience has soured me on women.
family?
huh?
don, i was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
but, after all, you have yours.
it's not fair to you.  this whole --
let's just go, marsha.
no.
first off... corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
let's go.
you disappoint me, emma.  can't you guess?  for you. it was all for you ...
in the garage.
you're rich. what do you have to worry about?
yeah. i mean a little, you know.
but i also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
thank you. thank you so much.
are you saying she liked it?
soon as i'm back, i'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
we need you for security purposes, mr. grant.
will it melt in there?
having considered my position here at court, i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign.
<u>i'm</u> interested in the picture business.  my associates and i wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the apostles. but unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
bye, troy!
you do recognize it then?
i was told that your mother died. that your mother died when you were young --
oskar, please -
no. really, i'm... i don't feel well. i've got terrible pms.
...i'm a priest! i'm here to serve life, all you want to do is destroy it.
i am father vogler. i am a chaplain here. i thought you might like to talk to someone.
of course not.
where's the cabin?
the envelope contains ten thousand dollars. the subject will be delivering the currency in a...
talk to him.  tell him how you feel.
thank you, sir.  if they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
-- he went inside! --
a million flat.
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet t-shirt with no bra...
hid by day--fought by night.  at sunset one day, your father and i, peering through field glasses, saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn.  it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the beast of yugoslavia.
how'd you know?
after a while that hurts... doesn't it?
what's chromium?
anymore ideas...?
oh, hey, patrick.
i'll get my camera.
we'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. au revoir, madame.
i thought you were gonna throw these?
yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
we won, austin.
because... it's better for me that way. ok?
the one who got caught in the bathroom.  george michael.
see you made it.
andy?... what? what is it?  andy... are you okay?
yes. i just got busy.
i've been very lazy for a long, long time.
doesn't your foot hurt?
yes, the roving nurse...
i hear you're helpin' verona.
i'm in kinship. listen, sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
yeah. he went to harward.
you asked my name once; it's madeleine.
they've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
...yah, okay, i think i'll drive down there, then.
not with an officer, no, sir. the m.i. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
kid--kid--
what are they for?
freddy newendyke.
mr. hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  you have my sincere word...
why can't i go out to your folks' house? give me one good reason.
this monster escaped from cryo- prison this morning.
and if you think you can fuck me, don't. cause i'm fucking insulated fisher. protected. backed up on floppy. do you get me? i want my fucking money!
i know it has been terrible.  but it wasn't your fault. and now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. you understand?
hello, jean luc.
miguel, the trouble's come to us. if we're not ready...
boy, that's fucking genius.  you're a fucking genius.  then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. man, no way i coulda done that!
sure it does.
that's it.  my client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
what are we waiting for?
hi.
you might have mentioned you had that.
i love you, old man.
how's he doing?
oh - i've found plums.  we have plums in the orchard.  we have an orchard! she has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
no -- not as a rule.
time will tell.
good evening, sir. i was just making some--  governor hopper!
nothing, ray.  that larry, he's a pisser.  you did the casitas youth camp with him, didn't you?
manny...
all right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of cn-20 down there. nerve gas the whole nest?
i said all that?
but i wasn't.
it's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
balefire on you, selena!
good god, boy! yell!
it is.
your use of language has altered since our arrival. it is currently laced with -- shall i say -- more colorful metaphors: "double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
he looks dead.
no? you said i'm bringin' heat on you?! i gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! you're ordering me out?! you better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
you want me to keep that under the table for you?
so he's doing okay?
i'm sorry. please don't be mad at me for this.
mom?
and that's where you met jenny.
i'm sorry... i'm sorry...
i'm not here.
well, i don't know if that's ethical. you see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
he's a very sweet man.
if you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
ah!  oh....
'cause she will tell you.
decency?  hey listen, pal ...
oh... wandering about.
that was fun.  what now?
do you think the film could have cost that much?
well...
wanders out. honora turns to pauline and juliet.
sorry, love.
just get out of your vehicle...
what makes you think i play?
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
i wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
sure it is. and your hair is still chestnut brown.
are you getting this on tape?
i’ve got kids, i’m going home...
i don't know what his game is. he dismissed every one of ruth's proposals. and sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
so?
my god.
it's for last week's game.
what's wrong?
which nostril am i breathing through?
i love you.
we been through that.
our baby's going to nationals! lincoln, alabama -- look out!
i don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. i know people... i'm so tired i can hardly see out of my eyes. no sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. but it's too bad about the baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
why did you continue to see him?
i hope you have patience with me.  i do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, i will learn.
you're right, a kid is dead, but mook, this isn't the time.
there's a call for you --
your father asked you a question.
single malt?
yes... i hear you.  i just had to try.
you love sharks?
every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  odorless. undetectable by dogs.  undetectable by anyone.
mr. scott, get the transporter working. if we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  which way to the turbo shaft?
you got about six more big states to go before we find out.
that little shit!
i am very sorry, sir, i have not seen act two.
what do we do? we change the scam?
go to bed. you've got to be at work in the morning. there's nothing more we can do tonight.
you brought the money?
you sure got a way with women, bro.  what happened up there?
it's nothing. i burnt myself.
to be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
maybe... there's one thing you have to remember... you don't create the situations. you can only try to save people from them.
ahh, it's too late, anyway. it's too late.  listen, i could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... if you'd gimme my gun back.
that's me. i've been ionized, but i'm okay. i'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
give him an extra dollar.
i've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
sir -- we charged!..gentlemen -- and i hope you will quote me -- i cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp...
jesus, you alright?
did i say that?. i didn't mean it. or did i?  sometimes i think it would be fun.  go ahead, you better leave now. i can't open myself to you now. i'll tell you a little secret.  i want to die.
i checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
go easy.
i'm not an intellectual.... i mean, i read, but... fund-raising isn't what i...
back where?
what happened?!
what happened? who're you?
i'm in the movie business.
they're all nudes, if i'm not mistaken.
the game's over.  you lost.
what, are you a klansman or something?
at what?
have you got a better idea?
tell that to bobby ... and his wife and kid.
why are we stopping?
young man -- you got me there.
your hunting it, ain't ya? yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  an' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. so some on.
just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
daniel.  listen --
not guilty, your honor...
you'd be surprised.
does she know about saturday?
what do you think would be in order?
our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, mantan.  thanks for coming in.
cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
tomorrow?
dragline, lemme look at the picture.
the hell you call me?
did you hear that?
where's erica? you seen her?
are things gonna be okay with you and mom? is there anything i can --
ah. neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... i always admired that.
no. too... upright. might've been a person.
what the - ? how did you - ?
where we goin'?
tom isn't going to sit in with us, johnny.  he only handles specific areas of the family business.  tom?
it was an unusual experience.
she's right. they'll string her up.
it must be the most marvelous supper. we may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
a tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... there's another in residence at lindfarne now.
now i must hear this song.  an authentic pirate song.  have at it.
you want her sheets?
let's just walk, okay?
but it didn't stop. i know it didn't stop. granny told me it didn't.
you said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. but you did. beautifully. i heard you.
what's peggy sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
i... i don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
basically you'd have to re-write the victim's dna, alter it so that the dna will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
i'm not a kid.
willam!
it's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
but programmable. and expendable.
wait just a second.  you don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
certified ladies' man, huh?
but you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  isn't that against the rules?
and an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
naw, son, i didn't kill nobody.
yes...
that's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  greet the dawn with the breath of fire!  of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. i'm well into autumn. i'll have to be giving it all up after saturday. sweeten the tea with honey, harold. it's delicious.
what about a summary then.
this is big, you know.  very big! let's go out later, drink some firewater.  with the boys.  fred can call millie and -
they're dead in the water that morning. four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. and that evening they issue a general sos.
what bullshit? hey, i'm your brother. you wanna believe me -- you trust me?
she has a real spirit.
she dumped me.
listen, rog. i knew hobbes was funny, you know? i told you that. but i didn't really know just how funny he was. see... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. i'm hobbes's partner, right?  anyway, i've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. we never really knew what it was we were working on. hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
i -- i can't.
must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
it's just a joke.  a stupid joke.
then you'd be out of a job.
well... uh... i... i ain't got no, uh, firearms.
i was thinking about becoming a cop myself. do you take a test or something or just sign up?
mia...?
hello, there. what can i get you?
no.
so what do you think we're gonna talk about?
i'd prefer not to be the president to push the button if i can avoid it.
now listen, we've got a tip that the schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
who the hell are you?
how can i look at you and say this?
i didn't want to find out i wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
where you going?
victor. this has got to stop.  nobody's seen you in months. you haven't attended a single class.
so they're airing this tonight?
yo ho ho!
i'd come to the realization that everything i'd based my life on was false. and that my life had no meaning.
um... eve?
he must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
we had to work. my family was poor.
hi, mom.
it's not what you think.  okay, maybe it is....
what for?
you keep running that mouth i'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
fuck you.  you get the fuck out of here.
well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
rizzo pull the fucking lever!
then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
what you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
i want the money.
laz, i know about that girl.  good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  oh, laz. she's had a mess of crabs and them std's. what'chu thinking?
are you outta ya goddamn mind?
guenevere...
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
i don't think i can wait until tomorrow. this needs clearing up.
seven terraces of purgation.
i didn't really think anything of it. no -- i did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
what's wrong?
i respect life, don't you see? for each and every human life i have respect.
hey, buzz!!  you're flying!!
of course! the power converter! it works! of course, it works...  what chemicals do we use?
follow me.
man, she's losing it...
t'aggia parla. [italian-american slang for 'i've got to talk to you'] nicky... see that guy? 
dead.
so, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  that what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  that if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
i will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
you know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
there he is!
six years. shit. time flies, don't it? six years ago we were fartin' through armani and pissin' cristal. now look at us ...
what are you giving me with the flying fish? i know why you want to stick around - you're after sugar.
you keep it nice.  can i ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
sheriff, i can't afford not to fish toni...
alright i give in. but let's not end up in jail. okay?
sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. i'm just doin' my job here.
how can i tell you what i don't know!
why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
well i guess the question is this: do you remember miss simms?
i see my date is here.  and i think mr. bond is ready to leave.
yes.
who is this...?
did you ahh, love him?
easy money!
halloween. 1938..."war of the worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live martians were landing in grover's mill, new jersey!  but then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
yeah, sure.
well, don't worry about your fiancee.  we'll watch over her.
help you?
how much air-time have i got?
mom, i mean dad...
yeah.
sorry.
here.  go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
but it seems to be enough to condemn him.
sure you don't want to come with me?
we got a call from berkeley p.d. there was a killing.  a professor. icepick.  in his bed.  multiple stab wounds.  1977.
bob, can't you get them to wait for us? they're leaving us farther behind every day.
the comedian.  he's dead.  murdered.  that's all i know.
what would happen if i threw him into the core?
you know what i'd do, if i were you--before the card game i'd go to the purser's office.
you know, general, there is a gate of janus in rome which is only closed in time of peace.  sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
i have to tell mr greenleaf. i have to tell mr greenleaf. i have to tell mr greenleaf.
holy shit.
sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact i gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, i ain't got it. i chased enough girls in my life. i went to enough dances. i got hurt enough. i don't wanna get hurt no more. i just called a girl just now, and i got a real brush-off, boy. i figured i was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. some stupid woman who i didn't even wanna call up. she gave me the brush. i don't wanna go to the stardust ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like i was a bug. i got feelings, you know. i had enough pain. no, thank you.
not while i'm in training.
all kinds of things. making plans.
she'll have to learn.
yes. yours got the larger nielson share.
well, what is this?
that would scare her to death. she's terrified of hospitals. to her, a hospital is where you go to die.
cost you a thousand for the bond.
please excuse this interruption.
you and kay were like sisters?
sorry for what?
hugo.
what do you-?
why?
go to millie's hair salon in spitalfields. take her to the metro for a margarita. don't have to tell her who you are. just tell her jody was thinking --
tuesdays and thursdays.  but after play practice, i'm yours.
what do you mean?!
so all that bullshit about god and faith.
it's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. where are they?
what do you think i'm doing?  i'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
you have something, dr. weir?
... and karen.
shoes, if you want to know the truth. shoes are my thing.
i'd quit the army for you, if it came to that.
yeah. it's wedged in between wyoming and nevada. i'm sure you've seen pictures.
then let's do it.
yeah, all in crates.
yeah, right. the inspiration. it's a true story anyway, so i don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
what about juno?
gracious... no.
don't sweat it, man. i needed a kick in the ass. we're better friends for it.
what color is it?
hell of a defense mechanism.  you don't dare kill it.
mr. president?
nix.
i know what junk is.
oh, no.
how's it sound?
why did you betray me?  paris was ours for the taking!  all i needed was another few hundred men... why did you take back the army you gave me?
you speak.
no, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? you guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. you are into yourselves, as the saying goes. spend some time trying to be parents. take him to the mountains, fishing. you ought to let him get to know nature.
you... you found that at leon’s?
i wanted to kill him.
not bad for eleven dollars a day.
i don't want to start no fight with you, buddy. why do you say i'm full of shit?
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
"the female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." see i knew you never loved mark.
how did you meet him?
he's been cooked-off
and what has that to do with it?
what's that supposed to mean?
thanks, charlie.
come on walter, it's just--it's smokey.  so his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
you don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
hey, you! watch out there -- you're scuffing my brussels carpet -- consarn them.
how early?
don't be a rat, harry.
you don't think i've got it to give?
so i guess a blowjob's out of the question?
rough?
why wouldn't they?  look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
it'll be a while before he's up and running again.
there's always a way.  if people get to the pope or the president, you can get to him.
are there any special instructions?
i know where he is.
this the guy?
you're very macabre.
lots of people...
let's go...i think i stumbled onto somethin'...
...i don't think i know that hospital.
but...why?
do you still think the joker cares about money??
tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  jerry alongside. the quarterback sucks, man.  he's gonna get me killed.
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
i graduated from college. did great, summa cum laude and all. and i'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "exposed!"  an homage to miss julie conroy of xenia, ohio.
you're scared.
if you shut up i'll tell you.  the urgent message is...drop everything!  craig is in trouble.  come quick, don't call.
as if your mind's not all there.
oh, the usual reasons. a world full of people struggling for existence.
no, i mean you can do it from the cockpit.
no ... thanks though... i'll take a cigarette if you have one.
it will be good for both of us. i've got it all arranged.
where were you tonight?
hell, i've seen a lot worse reviews. i've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  like, that last "francis the mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  but it was a huge hit.
no. i have spoken to the queen.  her majesty's consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
where?
you have to add some twists and stuff. maybe they run out of gas.
preach... get it at johnny's.  you got a bet.
you sure?
what the heck are those for?
i never played for winos.
i like mookie a lot.
if you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
ever wondered why jenny greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
thank you.
what?
why would my father send this to me?
he's kind of a miracle.
what happened to your mother?  is she still alive?
alpha.  got it.  what the hell is attack plan alpha?
what does it say?
maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
sal, i don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
yes, i gathered as much.
what?
and...spencer wants to meet you for a drink at fluties pier 17.
wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me michael meyers is my uncle?
let's do it.
darn it!
his image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
he gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
well, mr. saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
first squad up, on line.  hicks, get yours in a cordon.  watch the rear.
he's going to be our lawyer in vegas.  nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  no reflection on tom; that's the way i want it.  besides, if i ever need any advice, who's a better consigliere than my father.
did you actually give williams that gun?
it wasn't my fault. i was just part of a team. i was doing my job...
aren't you a little early?
fine...
so why do you think i should work for the national security agency?
how's everything?
i'll make it part of the class. we'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
have you evacuated anyone?
are you sleeping?
if you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what i'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
what do you want to do?
i know. it's not like it makes all your problems go away.
oh! i'm sorry! i'm sorry! what have you got for me? is it finished?
three full bottles. but almost time to refill.
any trouble?
yes.
tell me, damn you!
that was nice.
the district attorney gives his men advice like that?
right!
there's hope and promise in it, jabez -- planting and promise of good harvest to come.
stoned?
ricky, i'm going to miss you. apparently you're the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i.
sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
i don't know.  he was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
we did it! we did it, my boy! we're going to see tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! rich!
you've heard of the national security agency?
are you sure, dear?
i thought you hated torah.
she gonna be long?
um, yeah sure, i guess.
any place.
you don't want to say hi to your father?
do whatever you want with it.  i don't care.  all i want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
i can't see!  i can't see!  daddy!
i don't have a pre-nup
tommy.  come on. relax.
his name's jones. 'invisible' jones.
i can't... they don't operate that way...
motorcycle.
where are you going?
but how? where do you place paul that night?
i just can't believe it. any of it!  look at this room!.. they designed it based on the tuaran pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  computer?
kent!
that's what i'm here for.
very good. now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
yeah. what are you doing now?
i'm sorry that i frightened you like that.  but i was so touched by your concern.  i've been lonely here.  perhaps we could be friends.
yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
excuse... excuse me, when do i go on?
if everything hadn't happened the way it has, then i wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
are you afraid?
so then she just stops calling.
hot goddamn day!
i don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
uh-huh.
i'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--what did you say?
is your stateroom alright?
great!
the obvious.  but we are both not interested in that right now.
what?
not for me. miniature golf's for pansies.
it's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
figure it out.  you got plenty of time.
mother... it's not what you think!
you just came down here for the weather, right, mr. nixon?
has he?
let me see your cash book, will you?
kenilworth...?
i can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
...need those cells from the crash ship. shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
we were worried to death.  it's awfully kind of you.
don't you want answers?
hell, i've had days i would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
... how did you get into marine salvage?
on monitor three.  was a glimpse of something.
say goodnight to sam for me.
i lost my key.
i never had it.
...hello?
would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
i have to talk seriously with you...
i'm sorry, but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland. you know how she loves to ski.
why?
where?
it's right there on your golf bag.
my sister megan, she's a big fat cow. was then, even more so now. i'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
then give me a minute...
he's going to be the pastor?
i don't know what you're talking about -- get fucked --
it could be fun.
is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
that's all there is.
eve! my understudy...
what do you charge for company, vivian?
not one bit.
i'm afraid i'll faint.
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud."
michelle cannot possibly accept!
look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  see if your father fits the profile.
i was going to do that for you.
a snake!
i know where we could get the money. a lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
and besides, sam wainwright's away in new york, and you're here in bedford falls.
this.  no point to it.
up.  we're moving out.
that's right.
let's just say that i'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
but - what can we accomplish?
erik. you don't understand.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
there's still a big spot on the floor.
no, because it's the egyptian goddess bast.
we taking bets?  what if you're wrong?
not for me ..
calloway, can't you do something about anna?
who's going to do it?
i didn't think you'd come today.
increases?
you're too modest, nixon.  you're as evil as i am.  we're both from poor families.  but others pay to feed the hunger in us.  in my case, millions of reactionaries.  in your case, millions of vietnamese.
do you even have a girlfriend, jesse?
you ok?
we're going to die.
what i say is, no. we don't do partners.
i said i don't intend to fire her. i just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
you used to love life. you don't exude this any more.
i want to make a good film.
have you always had it?
now that's bullshit, lee. every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. i'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. this is "doctor zhivago". this'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. two years! that's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
who? who knew just where to hit us? and <u>why</u>?
i am an experiment? i am freako?
okay ...
no.
what, then?
the thing!  he was lying there in the street, moaning.  but he pointed at it ... 22
i carried the king's child!  the queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
jake!
how'd you know?
i know exactly what you mean.
well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  they're from different cultures and different races.  that ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
what're you talking about?
i know. i just got it.  it was very funny.
less than a mile.  forty-one wagons, a company of redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
huh?
what if your life depended on it?
hey!!!
why not?
adrian.
take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
flynn... you can't... i
you what?
ellen, move aside...
keep the change.
yeah. i don't ever know what to say.
no... you don't think...?
this is zero.
yes, mr. hillyer, i am.
no.  no thank you.  i have work.
that's not it.  that's not the list.
finished.
sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. you can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
he's a white male... serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. and he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. not an apartment.
he was creepy.
gosh--that'll be something! you know what i better do in the morning?
have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
that must have cost you a fortune in stamps, ringo.
what for?
she's flying starships !
where did you get the gun?
now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
you can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
what makes you so sure?
no. he had more important work.
they've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
we'd gone to 'code blue,' we were administering electro...
that would take weeks.
that's right. alan comes by every three weeks or so.
a week's a long time, friend. anything can happen.  all of it bad.
i'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
never been here before?
put it in the middle of the room!
dad?  about last night?
shook me up.  i mean that you knew her and everything --
well, terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience.
hang on, sir... nine point seven... point eight... breakaway threshold...
yes.
then the informant is real.
rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
sir, it only costs a nickel.
yes, i will.
these are private -- these are for us.
it was fun, anyhow.
you never told me why you got kicked out of...
c'mon, larry. be good for you.
they barely talk anymore.
hold it! hold it in!
talley?
at first, i thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
perfect fit.
for a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
mmm-more like -- i have a little trouble. trusting people.
flozen foleva not good.
buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if i kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should i put this? they'd be officially discouraged.
i want my money.
i wish you'd stop being playful.
no.
these rings represent the commitment fisher and liz make to each other on the day. fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
it's my daughter, man.  i know i never told you about her, but god, i love that girl.  she calls herself zuzu petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is l.a. a fucking groupie partying with the pros.  you have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
okay, thanks.
so the chest is still out there somewhere.
there's something i've been meaning to tell you, heather.
how about some steak sauce?
not yet.
no -- something real.  something no one else knows.
every day.
steady it out!
i'll go in that fuckin' house right now! i'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> fbi, you cocksuckingmotherfucker!!  and i've got <u>smith</u>!  <u>i've got smith</u>!!
i ought to be after twenty years.
i wrote something special for you. i got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so i wrote you a new final speech.
i don't really like guns.  you shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
no. women're always followin' me 'round.
legend says he told sankara to go forth and combat evil. to do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
...this must be boring you.
and then i lost him.  in the fog.
okay, sometimes i'm a nineteen.
he works at a bank.
back in '37, you heard benny goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  you wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. you tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that benny goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  so you gave the clarinet to spencer.
hong kong, mr. bond!
australia.
i'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
all of it?
not really, no.  something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  when did it crash?
because i didn't have it. ray, i swear, melanie came in and grabbed it.  and someone killed her for it.
a million deaths are not enough for yueh...
a mortician.  he seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
i can't kill, grace. i can't kill anybody.
but she ran away.
it comforts you, doesn't it?
the wedding cake check?
all right.
oh, that's such a delightful age.
what, "is"?
aw--
it's twelve-thirty!
i have a plane to catch... going to washington.  an interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... i know what you're going through with ferrie, lou.  we'll talk tomorrow.
alright.  the truth is... i thought we had something here.
well it's big. and it's blue ...  ... it's really really blue.
well, what do you have for me today?
why did you unleash the pipe, i don't know?
hi, roper.
so what are you thinking for college?
you are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  he is a lucky man.
-- it's your ifb, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
that depends on you. one woman only used three minutes. another filled up three two hour tapes.
quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
on account of mitch?
i'll meet you down there.
yeah?
now this is war.
you get to come alive again in the country!
no.  did he really?
part of it has to do with a murder.  i've been working with ed exley on it.
the killer called her.
you're a really good kisser.
is the hatchet buried between the english and my french father?
thank you.
i'm willing to tell you my name.
when you eat him, may i have some?
i don't want to talk about it.  if you really want to know. i lost it. and i'm not sorry i did. that eye was cursed, auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
no.  she told me "right now."
mmm ... what are you doing?
are they hitting you up for donations? asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
can i be of service, miss price?
it was almost worth the trip--to find out that jesus christ in heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  i like his sense of humor, though--you know? he's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  you know what it says on the back? "pontius pilate athletic club." most people don't get it.  most people think there really is a pontius pilate athletic club.
what sort of problems are you planning exactly?
hello.  heard about that graduation present.  really quite a car. look, i know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  i'll tell you a couple of things about myself, i'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now i'm back.  i'm an athlete, so i rarely drink.  kickboxing.  you heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  don 'the dragon' wilson, lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  i can see by your face, no.  my point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
drive a man to drink.  took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
get in bed. y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? you're turning into a yuppie frankenstein, you love money so much.
lemme see it!
leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
but...  how long has this been happening?
frederick's done this whole new series that i'm sure you would really love.
oh, adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. one who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from pasadena. nothing against valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from pasadena, i don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
mm.
i buy that.
no, no, you're right. i don't want to kill anybody. all i want to do is be let alone.
did you tell walter?
i want them thrown in jail.
w...what?
a kiss for each page.
'course i do, they're my brothers.
we're not leaving you here, sir !
done.
i want you to listen to me. my father is a very dangerous man. you don't know how dangerous. you don't know how crazy.
someone's gonna see us.
oh.  where is this place?
no my brother, you have to go buy your own.
this in ridiculous.  i'm a pro.
i don't know. i didn't talk with them. the plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. i was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in america. that i was leaving on a plane this morning up to ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in america my best day.
...ray?
i must wend my way down river on the lord's work.
elaine, not yet. i promise you i really can change.
105-353.
how's he doing?
why do you ask?
oh, you! i'm not talking about her hands. they're difficult to ignore, i confess, but i'm speaking of her whole being. her whole being is extraordinary. the way she talks, for example. she's so articulate.
nguyen.  he twelve now.  not see him for eight years.
i mean i've got a job for you.
i'm sorry, mr. baxter.
hold it -- italy just finished. they're recognizing great britain.
you were following him night and day. you saw who killed him. you even took pictures of it. it was evelyn mulwray. she's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
beer, please.
why... should you care?
well i might go to dartmouth.
can i use the car tonight?
and that's a bad thing?
b.f.d. what do you plan to do? fly to kansas and woo little dorothy.
what are you talking about?
i ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... remember like i say, i found you in the road...
yeah walter, what's your point?
you don't listen very good.  this break in -- i can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  or i could see it gets forgotten.
it's not about him seeing you in it. it's how you feel. you'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. it's an inner thing.
we're all set,  sir.
what do i need a thief for? i've got the mask.
what were you saying, governor? sorry.
this.  right now.
you were right about the telephones. there are no lines, there's some problem.
she's nobody you should be concerned with.
out on my back when i was a small boy.
john millaney.
i don't think we should get into that.
i got you.
we have this political thing tonight. could you comb me out at the house?
that is sid!
mothballs, sir.
what do we do with the humvee?
look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as june 93 ...
aardvark, noun. an earth pig; an ant- eating african mammal. man, that sounds like the dozens.
yeah, your little cootchie knew.
--teddy kennedy?
two weeks and three days.
no.
how do you know?
harry, if i gave you leo's money you'd have ray bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
i just wanted to know if you were all right... the coast guard let me use their radio. is chief brody there?
sound.  like sonar, or radar. they home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
and then mallory stops mickey and says, 'hey, these are the brothers hun.'
now you're saying eduard was lured there?
did you talk to him?
you all wait here.  i'm going inside, take a look.
with pleasure.

that's it, it's go time.
me?  how would i know?  the only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
i know you haven't. look, just go meet him as a favor to me. i talked to this guy. hope i pronounced his name right. he sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are. he agreed to see you this saturday. he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. his words.
happy birthday, bill.
it was the feds. a truck load of guns gets snagged, customs comes down on n.y.p.d. for some answers - they come up with us. they're grabbing at straws. it's politics - nothing you can do.
you shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. this is family business and we have to pull together.
hey!  she wasted my dog!
did you get a hold of that horse guy?
what the heck were you thinkin'? heck, if i'm only gettin' bank interest, i'd look for complete security. heck, fdic. i don't see nothin' like that here.
ml?
sure. we'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. i already told your mother. i hope you don't mind.
that was fun. i don't think california is bad at all. it's a drag coming home.
no.
why fucking not!  i deserve it.
i don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
yes, i would!
take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
if i go across to santa rosa i'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
and spock with it. they are joined together.
they blamed my family for everything. they always said mr. langston saved anthony's life.
that they'll start touching us inside our heads.
you gotta be fucking crazy!  you got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
bad enough.
they know each other! khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies!
hildy!
i want ice!  who's got some--  oh, there it is.
some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
what you did changed my life.
yeah...yale thing.
here's the deal: you meet me tonight across from the garden. 33rd & 8th. at the beginning of the ninth inning. we'll listen to the end of the game together. you bring your cash, i'll bring mine.
spoken like a true believer.
agreed.
it's not over, brynner.
...janitor's job.
well?
if they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  how do i look?
i'm not jacking with armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
fine. the first thing to do is-- present mr. smith to the press--in the *right* way. hurry him along, bill.
ummm!! they smell delicious.
under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! that's ridiculous. you go home as usual--five o'clock every day. now i'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--i insist. it'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
the dante hicks dinner and a movie date. i think i've been on that one before.
honey, some of this is... farfetched. you take after me. people skills and common sense. good dependable qualities.
geronimo.  when you're really in love, you'll jump.  off the top of the empire state.  screaming 'geronimo' the whole way down.
no shit...  we killed a guy for baby laxative.
i want you to take this... to remember by.
no.  follow him.
ten points for our fearless leader ... sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the bill bixby trifecta -- ?
come on.
can you tell me anything?  do you have any ideas?
who's that?
i was told that there were certain things that only ratan could provide.
but i want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  my daughter.
well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
oh, that's all taken care of.  i'm giving them shore leave.  we'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and i checked with the coast guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her i got a new batch of rudy vallee records -
please, susan!  i need help! something is wrong with me!
what was her name?
i happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, charles.  could i not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
how much?  how much do i owe you?
say it.
what?
she's a he. his name is swifty.
you're a... you're sick.
well, martin, i only wear them in washington -- that's the trouble. but if you ever come down there, i'll show them to you.
i have an idea working in my head... 
i'm not afraid of you.  you couldn't kill me...he's in there and i want him back.  i'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
how old are you?
who told you that?
nothing is what i said! go on, kill me.  kill me.  i'm not afraid of you anymore. i don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. you're a sick animal.
he's a con man--crooked as a tree--and i was part of the racket--helped him!  now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--i'll excuse you!
you little pissant--
i know lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." we can't take the chance of tipping castor off.
laz, i said let...!
what's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
you call that john travolta/denny terio shit dancing? i wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
yes?  my <u>promotion</u>...?
what do you know of my pain?
come on, ray, time to go!
the empress death mask.
i mean, for good, jeffrey.
there were at least three, maybe four. but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. there's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
...diebold?
did you set me up?  did you set me up just to see me fail?
sorry, preysing. 
he's so ugly. guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
well, it's a living. but i'm excited about this.
my teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. so that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
no.
looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
i'm interested in long-term expectations.
don't be angry with me, daryl.
you think he really believed it?
the beginning?
jennifer.
so why did you marry him?
what?
let's just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  of course, i might have brought gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
where's the john?  let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
i told you less paper, less trouble.
if you graduate.
can you fly that thing.
it's her choice --  she's human --
what are you doing, ted?
out there.

kathy, please.  you're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
you're a l-lawyer?  i... i haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. i...
really? i poop too much.
i can't just hack my way inside.  there's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  i'd have to be physically at the terminal.
naw... i gotta...
you remember mr. longdale, don't you?
just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
hey, there you are.
yeah, can you say plagiarism?

christ, it's ho-jon!
romeo is…italian. always in and out of love.
let's move it we got company!
jeff, stay there.
yeah. all set. tomorrow morning. ten o'clock. room 211. barclay hotel on river street. oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, i'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
casey! casey!
which color was that?
uh, we can stop somewhere if you and adele haven't had time for breakfast, early.
i had to leave this place. i got depressed, seeing all the crap. and the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? they've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, i can't believe it.
okay, so do you see a door marked "core unit?" should be down at the far end to your left.
was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
ain't that something?!  that's just fine, baby.
yeah.
...we get our hands on him?
i was hilarious once, wasn't i?
i am so sorry!  forgive me, i --
yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  right?!  well you figured wrong, dork!
with everything that was going on in my life, i just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- i needed time.  viktor bought me that time.  i owe him so much.
kansas, i want you to meet someone special.
i don't see how... when i'm finished i return it right away.
we were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess. i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
but, i don't understand.
mostly.  armored cars can be hijacked.  trains can be derailed.  but nobody can get to us in flight.
they're not happy, sir.
how'd you know it was me?
so?
you finish the reading for e-con?
i hear him.  he rides to the hollow and back.
why don't we save it for later? it's almost time for letterman.
we saw the terrance and phillip movie!
you were just having a fight about me. wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
go inside at once.
why would anyone want this shitty job?
they weren't going to show it to me?!  the arrogance!  it's my <u>life</u>!
nothing, really. my guy is just doing it to stay alive.
oh, san diego? i've thought about moving to san diego.  it's hard to make a living in this town. these short hops.  can't make a dime on 'em. to lax, pasadena, then i can make a buck. these little hops cost me money.
what?
your dad's really gonna build his house?
with that ten thousand dollars i could build a tabernacle that'd make the wheeling island tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
yes, but...
what the hell...
-- why?
oh hell, forget it.
yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
maura.
what you been doing?
it's ok.
you on your way home?
look, i don't want your money!
uh, george...
he's better.  thank you for asking.  how's your friend?
polaris, where are you?  maybe i'm too far south.
i'm sorry. i don't know what else to say except i'm sorry.
thank you very much.
jesus, ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  you know that.  there's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
i won't be here next week.  the tumor's inoperable.  i'll be dead.
right now?
that was our idea when we first came. all we thought we would get out of this trip was a turkish bath, but... we learned better.
<u>you're surprised</u>!... but i guess i just never met the right guy.  whatta gonna do?
you fool, what have you done?
no. let's forget everything!  i've had it with you and your goddamn lies.

which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in london, grasping her oscar, and to be found filming most days on hampstead heath.
we are here on official business.
don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually one guy and--
he's a murderer. the law says he's gotta do his bid.
i don't really feel like talking about it. the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
buddy, i don't know if that's such a good idea.
people home.
he's got one!
about an hour ago.
hah!  stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  found 'em.
i didn't want to hurt you... all i wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  i swear i didn't want to hurt you.
what about it?
you'll have to forgive tiny, he can't hear so much.
i'm serious, honey. don't get out of my sight, all right? i want you to stay right by me. will you do that for me?

i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
you don't have two million.  three million - -
yes.
so was he scared?
kane.  do you have mr. john michael kane?
you have two murders to investigate. this man's head was beaten in. and there's nothing in his pockets.
i would like to explain something of my mission here.
go to the symphony --
do you have any idea where you're going?
why don 't the zulus attack?
you make me sick, you fuck. once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
i won't be needing these anymore.
are you talking about me?
why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
why?
that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them.
yes. i do.
well, they wouldn't own it, i'd own it. i'd pay them back in product.  they can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
look -- i'll be in there later today. i'll come by and tell you all about it.
uh... attention, attention! we're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
if you have to ask, you don't know.
nothing's broke.  keep sewing.  and quit pacing, you big ox.  you're making me skittish.
why?
you're from la, right?
...here!
uh..he might of.

don't do it!
what makes you so sure?
oh--saunders--
yep.  and guess who they hired to seal up the place?
oh dear god. its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
i expected more from you.
thank you.
o god. did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood? o serpent heart hid with a flowering face. was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? o, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
thanks.
you call this... glory...?  all this... this blood... this smell of...
god, i have no idea.  she's worked here for fifteen years and i have no idea.  i'll call her.
i can live with those reflections.
'it got us in hot water...we should have been there for carla....'
there's somethin' wrong about it, mother.
what else?
uh, huh.
would you sing for me?
[i need a driver to drive samuel, the father.]
there's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
this is very interesting. we are born knowing our history. we have other books. but not a book like this.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
or shitty!!  otis!!
i'll do it.  just let me find my portable phone.
enough!
got him!
if you believe it, darling, then i believe. being young can be just as confusing as being old. the things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
i was trying to be smooth.  but at twelve-fifteen i was gonna come over there and talk to you.
actually, i was a wonderful father.
what?
...yeah, it's a tough break.
i'm going to marry the woman i love.
hey creek, you ever see anything like that before?
now, wait a minute -- i wrote you.
you're not the one trying to get all this shit. you think they've just got a crooks r us on every corner?

let's go, vaughan.  frank, we'll be back in a little while. i'll bring you back somethin'. you're food's in the oven warmin' over.
you have faith, professor barnhardt
every day.  she makes the bed.
then i'd say we should put jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. we'll get extra data this time. video... infrared... the works.
what's your name?
judy, that's stupid.
i gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
but what makes a thought start?
or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
oh, it's a charity dinner. the money goes to a good cause, but i don't have anybody to go with...
i've discovered something interesting, charles.
i will.  see ya!
shoot sailor in the head with a gun... now i'm beginning to get it... you want me to shoot sailor in the head with a gun.
a bunch. must be halfa dozen newmeat.
-- listen, i'm supposed to take jill to el cholo tonight. she's really going to be pissed if i don't.
wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
he ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  he took his time.  the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  the victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  that's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  popped him.
it's a rapid prototyper. i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. it's the future of paleontology.
debbie.
that's in france.
you should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the lord.  we've got some food on the trees, thank the lord again.  and we've got rum, praise the lord.  we can stay alive a month, maybe more.  keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
studied acting, i assume?
but if this trial seems fixed, i fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
father.
just a nickname.
yah, well, they exist all right.
you'll have to pack quickly.
you believe that?
what the hell's going on?
thank god...
i'm checking out anybody who lives like desalvo.  records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  if they've got a german wife.  we can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
jennifer's been with us four years. she was coming on nicely. but just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
no meurice, it's worse than that. something really happened, i think marty's dead--
yeah. only -- only i'm not leaving, walter.
alright, you got it. and i'll be putting an observer in with you.
wait a minute. the fight. where did he get you?
mr helpmann!
you guys having fun?

deb... it's me.  i need you to step out front.
you're holly.
and how many room got tv, dusty?
well, i don't know why it should. there's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  we're hardly unique here, billy.  i mean, i can understand how you feel.
a little out of my element.
take it slowly.
they come when you sleep.
of course --
look, sam, don't take it the wrong way when i tell you we won't be doing this again.
something funny, levi?
i'm not sure, but i can check.  did the events start before or after you discovered this?
marg!
go on. get in your tent. you don't know nothin'.
no, i'm good.
god may have given it, but claude banks spotted it and nurtured it.
another historical inaccuracy.
i can see that, alan.
goodbye, mr. fielding.
what's she doin' here?
what?
well, maybe i'd like to know just once!
somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  and the second greatest predator must take him down.
thank you.
your honor, mr. roston lived with the defendant for many months.  i feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the miss lawson.
you lost your control.
why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
what'd he say?
looking for a bloke named valentine. know him?
you taking dunbar?
where do i put ashore?
captain...

they will have our description before we can get a plane.

be good and be smart, little boy.
yes...?
paul's only twelve years old.
i don't know, doesn't make any sense.  i almost can't look at you.  like it hurts.
i demand to know what is going on...
mr. henry never gave you a test, did he?
we're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
what?
keep reading...
we're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. you gotta do this thing and i don't even know if you can.
bud, i hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  darien...lightning has struck! the lightbulb has been invented. edison, da vinci, einstein are watching...
jesus.
i'm not even good for me.

what the hell is botox?

ecentus stultorum magister.
i'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  she's going to east st. louis--to visit an aunt.

i was afraid of that.
go. i command you.
yes?
while you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
...resourceful!
what a good idea.
i guess i'm kind of...
...in the name of the lord jesus christ!!! it is he who commands you! he who flung you from the heights of heaven to the depths of hell!
arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because i don't think there is.
real charmer.
i've been in the same class with stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
it's okay...he doesn't believe me. that's his right. i'm starting to think i'm crazy, too.
what?
where'd he go?  i'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
that's right. he pushed me...in the other world. somebody pushes me, i push back. so i brought him down here ... what's the matter, sark? you look nervous.
can't get a little bit pregnant, bud.
things went badly in palermo?
jesse, you explain to lyla. my girl, you know, from that time...
what's that?
palmer, you and copper tie everyone down.  real tight.
what are you getting at?
what are they doing?
it's really not a bad place.  it just needs a woman's touch.
do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
maybe you're right.  twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
it's cochrane.
floris, get guinness on the phone.
i think it's been a pleasure.
six-toed cats. assyrians. abyssinians. it's the same difference. well don't think this terry malloy is any six-toed cockeyed assyrian. he's a bum. charley and johnny friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
who's your favorite basketball player?
you mean hiding them?
don't be an ass, auggie. he's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?

where do your people come from?  where is your home?
) the track? did you run into lilly?
i know. they're rich drug addicts and celebrities. when i saw james taylor there, and --
come on with that money!
can i offer you something.    a drink? coffee?
anyhow, he's always saying to me, dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
not tonight?... you're not driving up tonight?
you snore.
i'll call him, then call you back...if you want you could stay at my place.
your dad taught you everything.
please!  and what happens after tomorrow?
you want to play "cora." you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it.
this is what you do with your spare time?
tom, you startled me! you're back.
jack, take it easy. she gave blood at school today. maybe she's just a little light—headed.
now take deep breaths, and push.
how can i make myself clear... it is difficult to express but i'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. please, comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... i am in the rhythm of it now... i don't want to go away. i don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. it throws one out of gear.... let me finish my work... i have concentrated everything in it... please... don't make me go.

she bought it.
i need something to keep me awake.
don't you even miss me? didn't i mean anything to you?
so you are dr. kynes, the imperial ecologist?
you know, monsieur mercier, this is all non-sense.
ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
could you give me a ride?
right here.  right here.  <u>inside</u> the magician.  shhhh.
what's it doing on a rifle range?
<b>what if i, don't wanna put out? that's all you ever say relax put out i'm a living creature, i have feelings too, i don't need this abuse from you-</b>
let me remind you who is the new race. and who is the old.  what could be gained by withholding anything from them; by pretending to ignorance? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. to start colonization early.
he was here?
where's the money?
but, senor--
oh, just traveling through, huh?

hi, nikki. mike. i don't think this is working out. i think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. it's not you, really. it's me. it's only been six months...
you're nothing.  do you understand me! you're nobody...
oh, tracy... i have to tell you, i'm not the one to talk to about this.
i don’t know.
that's right!
but you said you have the worst reputation.
i'm glad of it.
there are only ten.
it may not be that simple. this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
that's god's way!
this town ain't big enough for the two of us!
and i keep, you know, it's-
lay down.  stay down, bobby.
you shouldn't smoke so many of those.
do you feel alone right now?

carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  he'll be more useful now.
no fingerprints?
mr. nasty time?
yes.  but
fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
he'll get caught.  if he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
this is california. the richest, most populous state in america. and growing like a sonofagun.
but i'd do it, i'd get that one into him.  so help me god, i would.
which would you rather...?
is there anything you do?
elaine --
come on speak up, gooding, i'm trying to run a business here. i can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
good concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
aye?
wonderful!
it's just money.  you should be glad you're alive.
sir, please lower your voice--
we seem to have a little problem here?
right here.  in the 7th street subway station.
that's a nice piece of heat right there.
i just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  of you both!
is that supposed to be funny?
there's a few things you don't know about women, brother malcolm. they're possessive and vain.
is that what you think--
it's just an undercoat. 
thank you for saying that...
cut away from me?
that lady is back, sir.
what do you mean you made it all up?

you think i should hang around more with the crew?
what?
listen, i'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
i don't like snakes.  i remember the one cleopatra used.  cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  you'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
. . . i look at you, lenny, and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
which way? right or left?
....i'm taking sp5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  i have a hard time concentrating.  please forgive me, i slipped on....
maybe i was there, but i didn't see anythin'. all i know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
i care for her.
any sign of santa?
want anything to drink?
you don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- good morning, miss kubelik -- good night, mr. sheldrake -- i'm still crazy about you, fran.
look at you two. you both disgust me.
yes.
please let me go.
bravo, mozart. most charming. yes, indeed. clever man.
sheriff deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
you've made your point.
come on, let's go, i got to get back.
i was hoping you'd call, babe. look, you got representation?
it's okay with me, hi kevin.
i *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
ed wood!  you came to my party.  i directed "bride of the atom"!
so, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
now stay with me, boys. what did they do to make two such identical wounds? did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? no. two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! that's all she fuckin' wrote!
no!
will you excuse us please?
your brother stumbled upon adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? and traded his silence for a kid and some cash. and adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. he came to extort a second kid’s life. your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. there was no exhibition. just as you suspected. remember, deborah? “leon does his own prints. wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘art’”.  i should have paid more attention to your words. perhaps it’s the way you say them...
where've you been?
most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
that's what counts. if you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. that's why i quit college... plus i'm a lazy bastard.  wait, i know this... a votre sante.
look... search your own records, if you prefer. you can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. if we find buffalo bill through your information, i'll suppress it. nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
you sell anything?
yes.
i mean it's like, you know, i do my art because that's what i am, you know?  i'm an artist.  i'm not like a banker, you know.  like i create.
... i don't send you men, anymore. you don't know what to do with them.
so, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the first lady?
many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but i have to tell you that, being a police officer, i've seen it happen: young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, i'm gettin' a call on the radio, i got a 422 --
to do my work well, i have little time for --
oh look what he did in them.
you -- i don't know.
glad to meet you.
uh-huh.
holy shit. your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
still, please.
everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
i rang.  it seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
...upset and impressionable...  get me the mayor...
according to dr. darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  q.e.d.
herr mozart -
my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. hit was bloody-like around that towel. hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
i took the couch.  i had some work to do.  about last night...
someone better tell mac.
seriously.
you know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, stanley....  i'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if i don't, i come home without the money....
shut up!
royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
you have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
indeed.  after how long?  a few weeks? i have been here thirty years.  and yet, it would seem, i know nothing.
sure. mostly often.
i really don't mean to be discourteous.  but how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in new england?
are you in the middle of something?
behold!
a million dollars is a lot a damn money! and there they are, they got my daughter!
oh my god, i've dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl.
those are canaries, miss.  doesn't this make you feel awful?
maybe we should've tried to hop it.
well, you know, i think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
and a mr. michael lowenstein, i don't know what he does.
yeah, i'm hungry too. i know of a place. let's go eat.
aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
when did you find out?
i don't think so.  what about skydiving? a crank call to billy graham?
later. listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
didn't you have no inkling?
you know what you got here?
he shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
to find the man in black, obviously.
well, i didn't see him anymore, i'll tell you that much.
if he's looking for a flaw in the system --
i thought you guys were busted.
please god. not on us. drop it on mrs. evans. she's a cow.
well, can you give him this for me?
there were two.  not one.  but two.
i don't think i could.
she's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. you just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. my sister loves you, motherfucker, and i ain't gonna have you break her heart.
yes.  that's true.  actually, at this point, i just want a job.  wait. what do you mean... yet?
one night with me!
listen, you don't havta come?
yes it is.
who is this man?
do you pack a gat?[11] a close view of the two shows the smile dying on shapeley's face. he looks up quickly.
c’mon jack...
his name is skipper, dad... steady.
i don't really. but understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when i'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. and i don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
-no cheesy poofs.
yeah.  i'm rooney.
this is evanna, the team pilot.
hello.
did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  it was tax shelters, wasn't it?  swiss debenture-swaps.
schwartz.
this done happen before. it ain't nothin' -- i just have to wait a minute or two.
that little bitch made a fool of us i want her out of the election. getting everybody all riled up like that.  she's finished, you hear me? washed up.
very creative. now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
what are you lookin' at?
it's a disease. it's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
some people can read 'war and peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  y'know.
i got a call from a gentleman who's going to costa rica, or thereabouts. if he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  and very well-funded.
jack and i are united in holy matrimony.
how's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
any luck?
yeah —- sure.
what would you do in my place?
i suppose. but i'll tell you, jake, i'm like a little animal. when i get my teeth into something i never let go. if your daughter's here, i'll track her down.
don't let victor push you into making a mistake --
because i don't know.
no. we won't. i have climbed it a time or two before, and i know all the places to step. just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. if you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
i fucking hate raoul.  shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
oh, that's all right, i've got lots more. want to see the reception?
i wasn't driving. i'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. could it have been deliberate?
i like it. it's... sexy.
well, guess what? i found betty... where she's been, anyway.
physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. how do you explain your behavior?
fuckin a, i think i got two partial prints here!
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
sir, what is it? there's something you're not telling me.
are we havin' fun or what?
why don't you get to the point.
cute cat. what's his name.
all right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
just take my work for it.
the water was dripping, see... i turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then auggie had to go out, and so i left the back room ... and later on ... well, later on ... when auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. his cuban cigars got all messed up ... you know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
bad idea...
i'm just a demon, nicky. i don't got devil blood in me. i'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
sure i do.
ha! did ya see that!  hey, cheswick!
i always, i-i always imagine that i have things.
you've arrived.  you've been recognized.  you're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
mr blattis, of our local news- paper. you sure it's a suicide?
how much?
about six months ago. why?
i've never seen anything like it.
i heard you talking. i could tell where you were in the room.
you shouldn't have to see this.  why don't you get out of here?  go for a walk.
no, not in the shop. but i can order them for you.
i'll send a cop back for you.
you... you selfish, selfish child. at least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
no way. no way.
have they done skin testing for allergies?
oh?
following new course. warp seven.
is that agent desmond's vehicle?
your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  it's not going to hurt forever, paul, i promise you.
there's a lisa shermer living just sixty miles west of here. over the indiana border. i'm going.
kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. now if you'll excuse me, i have some work to do.
i'm curious.  the d-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
don't push me away.
yeah. true. the cops weren't much help either. their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. make sense to you?
you ever wear one of these?
if they get set up in time, which i doubt.  and even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a ford.
oh, hello vanessa. how was the flight?
it's okay. we broke up.
they treating you right over at the bodwins?
but i bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
finch!  get to the bathroom!  now!
no. don't do this.
nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you redhook bastard.
but where are you going?
our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
no, i can't! i can't! you've got to let me rest! you've got to let me rest!
oh yes, she's... wonderful.
did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
and i would like to see a priest.
that night?
no.
i don't know what to do! i don't know what to do! crap. crap...
we have had fun, you and i. fun for a little boy in an old palace.
i don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
i got into a little crap game.
i'm sorry. i can't do it.
right.
do i look all right?
well, john adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
no kidding. when i saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
how do i know if this is love ?
sixty lira?
but you're very private people.  you know, there's a kind of elitism...
why are you doing this?
i told what's his name -- tom -- that i'd meet him.
the mirror is broken.  it was broken when i found it.
it's dark.
i'm scared.
no, she was not as beautiful.
no future-telling, please, i've been terrified enough for one day.
no chance.  not their sector.  they ain't even into things this big. our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  something else.  unit nine found a couple cold ones in hollywood.  one manny turner.  gun runner. sounds like a connection to me.
yeah, well, i'm going to work as a cowboy now... or thinking about it. it's a routine, like anything. what do you think?
"was this in actuality andy kaufman? and if it was andy kaufman, is andy kaufman crazy?"
i don't know.
you seem a little hostile today.
karl? did you put this in regan's bedroom?
i'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
dowd. eddie dowd.
can ya dig it?
how'd ya like hearin' ya name on tv?
i've worked with it.  i've seen cures. it is at least a hope.
we don't need no fences at camp 8, boss.
no doctor!
do you know what happened yesterday, carter?  i was officially nominated for the commissioner's post for the lapd. there was a dinner last night, two hundred lapd officers were there.
detective, does it look like a murder?
it came over from vietnam, you know.
speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? two hours?  that doesn't even make any sense --
i don't know.
doesn't it matter to you?
who are those girls?
you forgot to tell me what a city sealer has to do.
i think i...i'm about to... am i mistaken, or don't i get to... is there some...
i don't mind getting older.  i'm obsolete anyway.  why try to hide it?
not yet.  where's mr. ripley?
please, dad, just do it.
is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
i don't wanna see that.
no.
yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
he likes it.
i'll do it.
and i'm a republican.
is someone else here?
if you please.
jack...don’t even start...
you look just fine...  ... by the way. what's your name?
the suit will stretch. you should try it --
july.
you know each other?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
oh, i love that stuff.
well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
so i'll have to order in?
don't take it personally.
you know, i just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. and i've been doing just fine.
well i'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
eddie valiant... you're under arrest! just kidding...
you're a princess...
i'm leaving it here.  come get it and keep moving.
no shit. you know how he makes his money?
you watch your tongue.
crazy fucker.
everyone i know has met her, viktor.
captain?
mr. scott, how soon can we get underway?
you know, you said something to me when you first met me that i've thought about a great deal.
how would you know? you're looking at my tits.  jesus, carl. your job is to keep us on the road!
i'm not asking you to believe me. you'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. you're all coming with me.
just curious.  that's a nasty cut you've got.
why not? maybe she'll help me. you won't. you'd better stay here.
what's that smell!?
tell me what happened?
follow me then to plainer ground.  god, i love this!
your honor, this is absurd. the woman's obviously in love with him.
i'm tired, too, frank.  if i ain't around no more, it don't mean i don't care fer ye. i care for ye a good deal. i care for you more than anybody they is. we made friends right off the bat.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
i hope i don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! there is something! if i can just -- yes, i'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
john's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
the time wasn't right.
how you doing? we're looking for slim.
mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  i'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
and he was missing an arm.
i don't think it would fit you.
don't you think it's time to go now? running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
come on.  yeah. you know what? you know, i like you, i really mean it. i really do like you.
what do you want?
someone's playing hardball.  it's complicated.  can i ask a favor?
joe, from the day i arrived to the day they fired me, i performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. and if they hadn't fired me, that's what i'd be doing today.

hey, buddy...
right.  hey, shut up. okay, sir.
thank you.
do you really know superman?
throws what? how could he have a time bomb?
would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
an investigation? it was a bus accident.
wait...don't leave me in here...
no.
don't address me.  i didn't make the accusation.
nick, what happened --
well, saavik. i guess this is goodbye.
you're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  i mean, i just wanna know.
a cloud?
i know it's not.
jesus.  it's slower than hell.
you really think so?  did you tell him you were pregnant?
got your badge?
thank you.  they hated me.  i don't hate them.
you're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
we're going to need some time.
i think there's an angle.
i've been putting this together for over a year.  i have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  they won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  just use my checkbook to get them there. i'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  if we hesitate, all will be lost.
okay that hurt.
eduardo.  rama.
it doesn't seem fair. you're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
what?
no.
he told me to play blue-face with buzz. i like games.
here's your fifty.
what's going to happen to jack and me?
can of itself be a problem.
[uncertainly] in that thing...the jacket.
no one will know your name.
this isn't everything. get ready for this... there's a museum of murder and mayhem.
but you knew, that day, that i wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. who was at the top when you got there? elster? with his wife?
jennifer, give mr. black a map of the city.
why you have an attitude for?
oh, well, that's just it. she's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. if i'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
perhaps we ought to celebrate, irene.
i could teach you a thing or two now.
does what?
indeed. just a moment - as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him. a very appropriate person to do so. yes.
okay.
i really think you need to calm down now, okay?
steady, now. we need your help.
uncle, 'tis a shame.
excuse me, colonel. i have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. i think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
thanks a lot, that was the best. you're next.
i am, joe.
well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
luck, jim.  don't forget.
kyle?
you couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
come off--come off right. i'm on my way in. you go free, i'm engaging.
there are cables overhead.  hang on.  it'll clear up.
well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
am i correct in assuming, mr. kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
sorry, sorry. had to renew my papers. italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. have you been waiting long?
oh, you --
that's the ticket, laddie.
just put it in your purse.
jill layton ...  you're a very good little girl. what are you doing here?
norstars.
some fishermen in west virginia found an unidentified girl's body. it's a buffalo bill-type situation. been in the water about a week, and jack needs somebody that can print a floater. think you can handle it?
really?
says me.
okay...same as usual...
ben, i've been crunching the numbers on the machine. i think if we can rework the power settings...
yeah, you know. you know what it felt like.
well, you obviously don't know me.
it's the middle of the night.  they're asleep.  phone didn't wake them.
you've made your point.
you'll be sorry?
you know how your daddy is.
fuck my life.  fuck fight club.  fuck you and fuck marla.  i'm sick of this.  how's that?
mitch, let's turn back.
let's go right now.  let's go to the zoo.
a homosexual encounter.
when you didn't come to the club.
you understand you're on trial for murder?
i thought i told you to get lost.
i'm going to find out.
that's what i tell someone when i'm trying to get them in my bed.
i suppose she is very entertaining... it must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
it's much better than your shoes.
i don't remember... anyway, andy's okay...
that's what i've been tellin' ya. the guy was like a mad dog. so the cops aren't looking for me?
where's your gun, your pistol?
madox knows, i think.  he's tried to warn me.  he keeps talking about anna karenina.  i think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
if a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
you're really terrific, you know what i mean --linnea rolls over and faces him.
it's going to be closer.  you better get going.
they're coming!
hard to believe, isn't it...?
i'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
how much did that frame cost, mr. franknum?
yes.
i know that.
for what? because i'm a dangerous man. because i know too much about the truth.
liz -- can i call you liz? it's a beautiful name --
there's something out there!  let's go get it now!  that's why we came down here, isn't it?
well, then i do apologize... but what i'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
-- you know, i used to be a high fashion model. tried it for six months and almost freaked. makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
hey, i can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
no.
the car.  all you want is the car?
is that all the coke in the place?
josie, you look rufus.
that must be it.
you must be going somewhere.
hello, bernie.
where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
wait.  wait.  we can't play today. i have too many appointments.
what's the status of the decryption effort?
you mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
you can't turn him off.  he's the commissioner.
perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
about doing things. you light candles, say prayers, keep the sabbath, visit the sick....
there's no right or wrong.  but if you don't give me an honest response, i can't help you.  i want to help you.  i want to know all about you.
so?
you've made a wonderful impression. your views are liberal... it is easy to see you have an open mind.
sorry.
you all right back there, mate?
you didn't call the sandwich joint with a urgent message?
okay, now go under go under it ! shoot vader's tie fighter ! get him get him !
it's better than real. it's synthetic flesh. synthetic blood. synthetic organs...  it's a physiological machine.
the whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
is that your driver?
finland.
it's your lucky day. you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
yeah, me too. he was a helluva good writer. and i would know. i discovered him. made him what he was.
yes.
i'm afraid that anna has come back. i feel she's back, and that they're together.
where is it?
stop. what about maserati boy?
what's going on here?
yes...
just lucky, admiral.
she took care of the dealers...
i don't think that's entirely true, grover.
what am i going to do?
i'm leaving.
pool.
so what'd i miss?
i am not here, ol' buddy. the cia has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left hong kong.
everything alright, mr. boone?
my heart stays here.
alvy, i...
i embellished.
that's all right.  we have no secrets from our readers.  mr. thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, mr. bernstein.  he knows what's wrong with every issue since i've taken charge. what's the cable?
sam! what a surprise!
man, monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
so, what did you do?
hopefully sooner than later.
why did he go to see mary rooney?
it's a little "silence of the lambs" for me.  i can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.

it was some guy called brian.
i guess we'll call you two-ply.
it's a dangerous procedure. if i miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... but i'm willing to try it.
not great.
where are the keys to the motor home?
for god's sake, lilly!
no, i mean about her appearance. if she should leave the valley - what would happen?
i'm glad you're female.  do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
almost that fast. i got a few loose ends to tie up first. came into a shitload of money recently. i've always wanted to go to take a trip. we're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
which would you choose?
the blood transfusion continues. marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. nikolas watches léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. marc keeps a close watch on nikolas, who grows paler and paler. his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to nikolas again.
try seven.  from unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  you wanna tell me what's going on?  huh?
i was hoping we could have a special evening.
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  but with no gold! the new world proves expensive, your majesty.
radical.
you ever going to open those letters? miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
oh jesus.
i never had sex with you!
ed, this isn't the real world! you've surrounded yourself with weirdos!
an "ootheca". an eggcase. it probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
anybody have a cigarette?  but seriously, do me a favor and concorde me back to prison.  i don't care anymore.  i hope you have the receipts for the threads.
do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
i've been thinking. i've been thinking about us. i'm sorry i've been so hard no you these past couple days. i realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and i couldn't handle it!  i've never revealed myself to anyone the way i have to you. let's blow this town together.  we'll run a bed-and-breakfast in vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
i'll have to re-energize.
you didn't miss much. rob and carrie say hello.
let's relax tonight, just the two of us. i'll make a quiet italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
wow. this must be big.
my friends call me "mister president."
don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  you'll live longer.
this boat's gonna sail without you, too. i don't care if i last one day out here. at least it's one day of freedom. now gimme those keys.
how much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
we'll pass around cigars....
so, you surviving without me?
you version of it.
yes.  that's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
nice hops.
oona?  do you suppose it's a faerie?
nothing. 
i made a deal with josh.
you want a tip?
who said that?
cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
kit, i left that money for you days ago.
deadwood, is that what it's called? cool, will you show us?
it's on...
fine. they felt that since you had such close ties with the president, you would be a splendid choice.  ... can i help you? are you looking for something?
he's dead.
i'm the only guy ever to beat sugar ray, and i still don't have a shot at the title.
johnny, the doctors explained --
i don't know.  he spoke to me last night on the boat. i liked him very much.
hello?
what happens to dunbar now?
i too was blind. i knew about her - and i did nothing. i trusted too much.
it's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. you're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>show</u> your affection.
oh. gee, you're swell! oh.
basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! what are you doing?
yeah-well, i didn't start out spying. i-i thought i'd surprise yuh. pick you up after school.
but we do have a choice.  to make it better.  instead of worse.
no.
dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. it was made by your ass. you've been dragging it all fucking week. what happened to you yesterday?
you can go first.
i believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
dr. zira! silence that man!
barzini wants to arrange a meeting. says we can straighten any of our problems out.
nancy...
what-?
we're not leaving crutch!
come in.
all right then! yes!
he's gone?
where is he?? he was supposed to meet me.
you're not going to hit me?
can you trust him?
all right. but this better be good.
that's what you think.  okay...truth... i'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd century. i've been sent back in time to bring two humpback whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
no problem.
ha!
here you are, senator. not a bad desk, either. daniel webster used to use it.
why? what for?
deep down. way down.
you have no conception of this, do you?
apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  this could be a chance to win him over.
swell. i appreciate it.
tough break. most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
hello, william. i understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. i would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
i am?
housecleaning?  it would be ugly, henry, really ugly ...
not today.  come on, thea....
it's not just a dream.  it's real, you moron! i know the date is happens!!
she's amazing.  she's ninety-three, she's a writer, and i told her about you.
the door needs a lock.
... oh? you've heard?
i drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...i let the ambass- ador out of my sight.
so then mr. gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. so that's what happened. i didn't wanna be a butcher.
you know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, toddy.  i'll be dropping by to see you and meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
a homo?
once-- just once-- i thought i'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
what's in the satchel?
assume away!
they fired a rocket at us.
why? you can't even lift one.
honey --
thank you, exposition. only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
good news?
if you send me away now, mara, i'll not come looking for you.
yes, i have a problem.  yes, i do, my fr...it's not me that ripped the joint off, i'm doing business. i'll be with you in a while.  you got it...?  where are you going?
were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
oh, it just ended, then.
he left.  i couldn't believe it-- he just left!  it's as if he's somewhere else... i'm only getting a piece of him.
i miss you too.
...well, it didn't make him happy...
soon as i'm back, i'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
take it easy.  everything's all right.  i put it on syphon, on the nose.
couple of more passes and i'll buy my own airplane.. hell, maybe my own airline....
sweetie, you won't believe it!  i've got the most incredible news!
it's gone now.
i'll do it, jake.
lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  maybe i should see the ...bodies.
are you out of your mind? you scalped him!
this is all that survived?
thanks. good night, mrs. mitchell.
guess you'd know about that.  you're an entomologist, right?  how's business?
how old are you?
ni!
he's right, we can't rescind defcon 2. the soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
don't worry. we'll take care of it.
why didn't annie stay for dinner?
you get an equal cut.
what you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
is he chasing us?
pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
gimme western four-five-five-seven.
of course.  i simply love the... naturalness of it all.
when i said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, i meant for us. i know your record with sarber and webb, and i'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. no one walking on your heels. just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. i'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
you start closing again, you'll be on the board.
her...
solid alibis. he was with sidney when she was attacked.
i don't want you to!
where is she?
ida sessions.
he thought i was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
okay.
are you kidding?  you think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
why isn't she with you?
madison lives two blocks from their present location.
small moves, captain, small moves.
yes, sir.
hmmm ... well, i guess we will have to turn back.
do you know how she found the apartment?
no, he's not. you are.
not who, food.  should we get italian.
bitch! cunt! please, please, please don't do this, agent kulok. you need me.
yes, darling.
can we still get lecktor's message out of the paper?
i'm handing out a free lei to every customer! what do you think?
not anymore.  i was in love once - but i'd rather not talk about it.  how about a little cold pheasant?
a pass.
and?
how many did you put on that time?
you're not.
abby. what's the matter?
the antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... no one's going to be coming to help us.
you're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
thanks officer park...vance.
oh.
a vulgar term, but yes.
i said "great"...
see the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of seti the first, i'm sure of it.
safe? here? they'll kill me here. they're all afraid i'm gonna rat them out. people are already looking to walk away from me. i'm dead in here. you gotta get me out.
verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
fred!
what was that?
where do we find a carozza for the forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
i . . .
it's a good thing the school was flooded today.
i've never seen anybody punch clyde before.
'fish'?
--you believe in the president, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
did you say group 7 access?
stains of blood.
the boys are back in town!!!
a true and troubling question, gump... we'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  the baron must have left a trail.
oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
i'm not ...
the bond is broken.
uh-huh.
they castrated him. he can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! you have chosen to join my army! this army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
so--
i might.
i got caught in the storm. you were gone all night too.
no. the police have kindly provided us with a list.
wait a minute, walter. you can't do that!
too texan.  go with the stick.  thanks.  <u>what</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>albania</u>...we're locked into albania...why?
you are a rich woman.
no! don't! please!
that's puttin' it mildly.
you shouldn't watch, jerry.  it's a moment without hope.
i didn't.
no.
here...use a spoon.
after her, i realized that to survive i had to live without... it's dangerous to let things become complicated.
i believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
well, the night is young. did you straighten out the chair situation?
always.
the girl hostages.
i loved you since the day i met you, and i haven't stopped.
anna, what are you trying to say...
i care only about michelle.  should i ask her when we first arrive? or... or when we're leaving?  i could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. i get so confused...
i mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
and the idea is that the beautiful mad carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of elster's wife?  ah, johnny! come on!
mr. maranzano sends his warmest regards.
what steps do we take now?
what are you - a couple of comedians? get out of here!  long distance?  get me the william morris agency in new york.
i know your face, you're an up-and-comer. you bowl on the tour.
when you read it we'll talk about it...
honey, you're exhausted.  do you want to lie down for a little while?
what do you mean? you've been frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. you're closer to her than anyone.
don't tell me you really are in love?
that's right.
yes, better get me a half.  all i can afford.
do you have a special grudge against me? do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
i want to duel him left-handed.
answer the question.
we got to get another pilot.
what do you want?
it's my fault.
yes.
i'm afraid i can't really let you through then, sir.
i'm sorry.  i don't smoke.
it's a very nice letter. but i have to go with what's best for the students.
i don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
that's what i'm here to talk to your brother about.  what's with him, i got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
every word that boy said is the truth! i'm not fit for office! i'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! expel me--!
after 12 years in the minor leagues, i don't tryout.  besides-- i don't believe in, quantum physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
where the hell were you? we were all set -- beer, broads. right? am i right?
can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
no, but a lot of other people.  you should come.  you should come out with us.
"well, if you got drunk to talk to me about miss alexander, don't bother. i'm not interested. i've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? all right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. it's obvious the people prefer jim gettys to me."
are you crazy?  that costs a fortune!
i said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
all right. sure. just curious. the picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
coffee?
i don't know.
jack foley.  you've probably heard of me.
liar!  thief!  torturer!  when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast.
found it.
it can't be a coincidence.  the woman that owns it has a son.  she says he's been on vacation in montana for the last ten days.  we're trying to locate him.  there's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  we're checking that out too.
not that one. the real story. did he ever tell you that?
that the problem, son?  you slow?
the bed's all made up if you want to stay.
wife?
why good?

as i remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. must run in the family--you wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
you're the one. i thought i told you to stay hidden behind the couch, cat! you've torn the unit apart.  you've driven a great leader insane...
i don't care to bargain.  it's full of saffron, just in case you think i'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
...they kicked out.
i turned him down flat.
some people do it for for enjoyment
m'hm.
how did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
ah, you know people there?
what about us?
how come ben can't turn it on and off like us?
you saved our lives. you did it!
huh? oh, geez, mr. hudsucker, i apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and i guess i must've mislaid --
i'm sorry - i don't seem able to understand anything you say. he's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
you sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
bulk... why don't we give mr. peep here a chance to think it over?
you getting my checks ... ?
they've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
wow, dude. wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
your mother was right. you do work too hard.
make sure you look after my son out here. don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, roy.
yes.
i'm sorry, i should have been watching where i...
what do you mean by that?
jim, it's just that i like the kid-- i don't want to see you get too rough on him.
eight miles. turn right to heading zero eight niner.
good idea of yours to come out here, harold. it's a lovely spot.
...that's a good motto.
or your fucking wife, you know.
the shostakovich.
they're not really going to call security are they?
that's very nice-a you, aunt theresa.
i'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, mcmanus.
a cattle ranch?
you all right?
he probably knows a lot more than that. somebody's lying.
he's not your son.
murder witness.
what are we delivering?
uh-huh.  it was wonderful.
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. i don't know where...
right.  you're quite the sir galahad today, aren't ya'?  i heard what you did with kross.
i've never been to the gulf of mexico.  is it as nice as they say?
all right.  i'll try anything once.
i'm sure you haven't any.
one half bar of chocolate. one bunch of keys on white metal ring. one packet of cigarettes. two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. one pocket comb - black plastic. one address book - imitation red leather. one ten penny piece. one white metal wristlet watch, "timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. anything else in your pockets?
my god, we tried to save her... you can't know... you can't know...
maybe he should be worried. about me.
finch!  where were you last night? what happened to the foolproof plan?
they're ready now.
without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. this is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. at jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "berthier sees only what is in the open," murat said.  "but don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  and so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
speed?
ray, karla won a trip to the bahamas! an island called tower bay. and she wants us to come with her.
she says she's rose dewitt bukater, right? rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic. at the age of 17. if she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
look. i almost killed my -- i almost killed someone.
if my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
fat chance!  you call him right back and tell him i'm not going.
nothing.
unusual?  i don't know.  i haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
trust me.  call that number.
yes, i know.
so he says you sent them?
i haven't paid you.
mr. thaddeus rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
is that everything?
yes, tell us, nancy.
you'll laugh.
come on, bro. spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
ricky tan is alive.
what are you thinking?  we were only supposed to scare him!
pirelli. coleman. agnew. shapiro.
i can help you through this the best i know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but i need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
"need" is a good, solid word.
that doesn't sound too good for business.
and he is still willing to give you a visa?
you mean if i get sick?
that you guys shouldn't be here.
nothing about the porters yet?
yes.  no.  yes.
what? what?
amnesia.
...i know you're down, but you know when you're down, drew, there's no place to go but up.
about who?
remember that demon in the gut? sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  that's what you want out of this, isn't it?
it's hard to find.  it's an old civil war cemetery.  nobody ever goes there.  so... what is it you say you do?
think back about what she said. exactly what she said.
it's about time you give my young friends a visit, chris. tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and i can't have that now, can i, chris?
i'm sorry. they're not used to seeing a car like this.
how can you tell?
i never heard of it.
it's my fault...i have to....
i just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
never mind.  i'm tired.  i'm going to take a nap.
ball games! don't break my heart! i wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the polo grounds. so you got a brother. well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin johnny gets mustard on his face at the polo grounds. if i was you—  — listen, i'm not asking you to do anything, terry. it's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
yeah.
i am after this race.
well done, mozart. really quite fine.
what's all the commotion? where's the cat?
agnes, oh agnes, agnes i want you to do something. i want you to pretend that i'm your mother. oh yes, only this time i want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
i want you to meet my cousin.
we probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
do you think they'll walk away?
there's somebody in the house, jack...
listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. just tell the old man that--
they don't get opened until eight.
wow.  do a puppet show for me, craig honey.
i don't know...
what's the idea of turning her down? it sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang?
this has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  i'm going home.  i'm going to try to get drunk.
look, i know what you must be thinking! poor little rich girl. what does she know about misery?
wow
starshells.
yes.
if you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
benjamin braddock.
well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
yes, but you said—
thank you.
there's no question you'll be friends. of course you'll be friends.
three, four oxen... much wampum.
larry....
give'em hell, sir !
daddy....
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
he's... dreamy.  he's...
so go get 'em, dad!
you may speak.
ah, right. the book.
sorry about all that...i'm your cit-- jasper.
i'm only asking for one thing. and it's not an extravagance. it's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
how come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
it's been totally charted.
he's dead, rose. your father passed.
file a grievance with the economic office, it's your right.
it's on peary street. just ask the people who run it. they'll remember her.  people who see miss jacqueline never forget her.
what, sweetheart?
sure. but eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
aw, please junebug?
sarah, do you think i'm a loser?
oh, please do come.  don't disappoint us. it'll be such fun.  and bring your yacht.
we had a slight burglary last night.
look, man, i know i owe you --
if we want it, it is.
i'm a lawyer.
i can describe it.
all right, for christ's sake. i promise i will never take out elaine robinson.
you think they're going to catch... where are you going?
stupid.
no offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
you do believe that i really love you?
i said i had a guy to see and i'm going to see him.
i don't understand...what does he want?
it's okay, really.
who are you?
let's go by rosarita's. you been there yet?
you're too good to me.
i'll do it.  the rest of you continue.
i don't believe in statistics.
i like cows.
care to join us?
my thanks.
but how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
he's fine. but i'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
i beg your pardon?
i... i just hired these guys to watch my back...
you did what?  who did you talk to? what for?
you don't seem to understand that this one's different. he has brains.
where's my ear?  who's seen my ear? did you see my ear?
she'd get angry.
will you let me go then?
well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
hi.
we're losing them.
suleiman!
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression.  it is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
i never do more than one. i'm sorry.
i am a fool.
want to know what i think happened?
don't spend it all in one place.
charlie...
physical resemblance is but one small thing!  louis has an arrogance, a manner --
yeah, explain it to me. i need an explanation. what's the matter with you?
thanks, man.
what do you want?
what you up to?
what did you say about a pet shop?
so saw my hands off, i left you a present.
the feds. it's evidence.
ed, i got the lugosi lookalikes outside.
...jesus h. christ.
next point. friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
laying in supplies, mrs. peel weather may get very nasty and i've no umbrella ...
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
i ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar remington behind.
you walk fast, don't you?
suzie toller is missing.
yes.  ahm.  i was just wondering where my english house guest had got to.
what did you say to them...?
well, hell, i guess that's it, then, huh? they're scarred for life.  they're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
what?
but i'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
if we agree that we are part of china, nothing else will matter. not trade, not defense. we will be lost.
well, bye, bye now. we have to go.
uh, no.
why the smirk?
the same to you. if you are in honduras, come to the bay islands and visit us. the hondurans are great friends of the american people. but i have a joke for you before i go. if a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the empire state building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
especially so tonight, major. in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
i think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  look at me -- not counting the american -- i've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
i can't.  if i had a minute to think, maybe, but i know you're wrong.
what's the point?
how can you keep doing this?
you believe?
how old you?
continued
because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
don't start, farmer.
and then what?
did mr. marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to miss lawson about his illness?
no kidding.
can i help?
then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
"this is gale gayley for channel four news!"  incredible. unbelievable!  for bernie laplante! he's a celebrity now?  'cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
never felt better.
ordell has a white guy working for him named louis.
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... i don't think cochrane built this thing for comfort.
yes.
men, they mostly faggots.
... then you really are a gardener?
you tried.
then do it through my lawyer!
no. what kind of bachelor party?
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store. you see, i hadn't planned on spending much time here.
nothing comes.
i'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
the timing was off -- i need this light.
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  a family heirloom, perhaps?
you should go to montana. stay with kevin's grandparents. they haven't seen him for a while.  i'll come and get you afterwards...
i had to sneak by the guards to get here. they say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
hildy!
are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
duffy! i'm sending bensinger over to see you.  mervyn, isn't it?
just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
i'm bleeding, bill, i'm <u>bleeding</u>...
i can see the attraction.
your majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  this is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which your majesty will be in a far better position to answer than i.  can napoleon afford to abandon moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
now that is a happy sound! tomorrow, i want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  the gods know, i'm tired.  come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
yeah?
whoo!
that's all talk.  he's got nothing on us.  he let you kill jake.
wasn't that sweet of me?
a little ol' boy.
your father will never let you.
are you an expert in amnesia?
welcome to venice. this place reeks, doesn't it? can you smell it? ugh. sorry. not the best way to spend your first day.
couple seconds of an argentine disco station.
according to you, yeah.  dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  i don't like you, comma, but neither do i go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the reds.  also, since we're talking repulsive, j.j. won't like this for two cents!  don't give me that look, dallas - j.j. believes in fair play.  and secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
uh, mr. the plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
so, what about those watergate clowns, john?  this fuck sirica's crazy. thirty-five-year sentences!  there were no weapons.  right?  no injuries. there was no success!  it's just ridiculous.
now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
what? 
i don't know.
your voice -- it's so familiar ...
i knew this was a mistake! i knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. i could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! don't you do it!" jesus, why don't i ever listen to myself?
i don't know -- few hours, i guess.
i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  means 'no.'
you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
how are you feeling?
what about the phosphorous grenade?
ah! so you admit there is someone!
i don't think so.
fine with me. just somebody then better go and round up melissa marr.
not if we keep 'em here.  you can't kidnap somebody in their own house. it's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  or something like that, i'm pretty sure.
you look way out there. out past the date line. west becomes east, all things change. you cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, i forget which.
terry!  you okay?
i've got a present. shut your eyes. keep 'em closed. i know you're going to love them.
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
found on carl's boat, too.  starboard side, second cleat from the stern. but it doesn't match carl's lines. it matches miyamoto's.  perfect.
blood sample? how close did you get to that thing?
you do?
no?
come on, you...
enterprise to reliant. come in, reliant.
the patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
i don't know. there's a small community of us. we have a place they don't know about. we're happy. we'll keep trying to figure out a way. come stay with us. join the struggle.
kay, you're scaring your partner.
don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
the 167 mustang shelby mustang gt-500.
captain, i've been observing the nurses on your shift. but naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
hey... very tense.
is it good?
come in! 
no, it's not true, you're lying.
i have heard many confessions, d'artagnan.  but even if i were not a priest, i could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
happy hanukkah tikva.
yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
say... god bless america!
are you using minoxidil?
lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
i've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
what's the matter with you! gettin' yellow?
oh, it was...  ... most of the time.
take the rope.
is it true you're going to interview dr. furtwängler today?
start over.
yes . . . yes . . . you're right, son.
where are you going?
he wants to see your map.
you did create me in your image, nathan. before you i was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. after you i became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. in a word, nathan, i became you. lila has reintroduced me to myself. and, incidentally, what i'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth. before when i killed, it was for food or in self-defense. now i will kill for revenge. revenge is an abstract concept, nathan. and i learned abstract thinking from you.
very nice.  i'll pay you for tonight as well.
sam, what are we going to do with you? can you hear me, sam?
i'm waiting for the fucking boat, colonel.
you didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
what are you implying, scully?
yes?
it's the atmosphere. too much pressure, not enough oxygen. might take a few days to --
ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
i'm curious.
...i feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
thank you...
yes.
a man would be more considerate. he wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
this should cover it, auggie-doggie.
don't you want me to?
so, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
well, sir, i'm an excellent filer.
oh --
nicky comes on sunday's.
it could be a man.
what about my proposal?
cliff, i must warn you. i know how to defend myself.
viktor, i'm so happy for us!
i know that.  what's it got to do with you?
that's all there is to it, huh?
like what.
what?
and incidental damages, if any...
you have nice red in your cheeks now.
i'll set john on you!
look.
didn't i do it?
and what are you thinking we should do now?
i grease the kraut guards. with ten percent of the take.
you can't tell this story.
never been out of it. i'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
sopranos up to f on the second 'voca'?
the past is the past. today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
then tell me what a king is! is he a man who believes only what others believe? is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? there is strength in you. i see it. i know it.
please get to your father and send him and the police to dorothy's apartment right away. be sure your father comes. something is happening over there. they're hurting someone, the guy she loves. tell them to hurry. i'm going over right now.
umm... yes. back home.
it's prince.  he's a prince freak.
i remember. you could do that, couldn't you? go down on me?
i can't ask her again -- nathan, stop it! jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- i feel terrible, hon.
are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
you seem disappointed.
what'd you all talk about?
you--a friend to me?
nothing.
how the fuck could he know?
hear those deputies slugged 'cente.
but you are interested?
this promise isn't subject to congressional approval.
no, he's the dad.
it's all going to work.  we're going to save the world.
well, i need to find out as much about daniel as possible.
thanks.
you're a natural. you were born to drive a car like this.
it's just that, you know, i was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. and, don't get me wrong. i'm not saying the book isn't really great -- i mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and i don't know, maybe i'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. and i was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
thank you, general.  but there's a price on my head.  if i don't pay off jabba the hutt, i'm a walking dead man.
she wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
well done.  brave girl.  you've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am i right?
don't be ridiculous.
hi.

lloyd, what happened...?
looks like richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
so mr. kirby, tell me, when you climbed k2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
oh, mom –– i'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.

is he some kind of celebrity or something?
how about family? got any family?
you could hear them?
let her go!
norman, this isn't about you.  this is something that's happening to me.  it's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
cool it.
my orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
count it.
i'm getting angry.
and what are we going to do now?
hi, ma.

why?  what do these guys have to do with ezekiel walters?
sure.
don't look much like he could. you say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
mr. crawford asked my opinion.  here we've got a purported x-ray, dr. lechter's surgery.  do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
i didn't have much choice.
dude here.
oh, i'm sorry.

would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- i once saw ringo starr.  or at least i think it was ringo.  it might have been that broke from 'fiddler on the roof,' toppy.
no no.  don't cry at the beginning of the date.
ann arbor isn't... that far from cleveland, right?
the real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  what took you?
how many times have you been in a line- up? it's always you and four dummies. the p.d. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. no way they'd line five felons in the same row. no way. and what the hell is a voice line-.up? a public defender could get you off of that.
if that's what you call it.
...i just missed my plane.
sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  what's this? i gave you two hundred.
there's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
i'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.

computer. request security procedure and access to project genesis summary.
mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing i do well...
that's it?  that's all you have to say?
yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
no way butt-hole! i want the window.
oh.
don't you think i do?  you say you're going down to xanadu?
it's our money.  he had no right to take it.
we can do that when we're very, very old.
i don't think so...
this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
you're saying stay away from him.
we were in the nick of time.  you were in great peril.
right. sorry.
this is he?
oh--yeah--
all of this so you could capture me?
ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
we've already got an ambulance on the way.  don't try to get out.
--i've read your profile.  i don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  you can have other children.
i'll see ya around, huh?
what're you talking about, george?
tell me, miss saunders--what time does the senate--uh--what do they call it?
it's too late. i've already ruined my life.
and mccord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the democratic convention.  the times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy cubans.
this could go off in a month -- or an hour.
i just might give you a ring when we get back to london.  there's one or two things i'd like to... will you let me have your number before you leave?  have you ever watched a commercial being made?

are you all right?  are you still you?
uh-oh -- john.  staring at what?
you are to be killed, exactly. they'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  if you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  a gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
i'd like to, that's all.  girls your age don't do that.  you need an explanation?
from what i hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
oh. okay.  i'll catch ya tomorrow then.
under arrest for murder.
no, mr. charles.

i'll kiss the baby for you.
get way.  you'll see when i'm ready. first i want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how i lay awake at night worrying--
you did? that's funny. so did we.
clay something, that was his name - clay.
what do we do now, everett?
let's go, let's go!
listen, jim -- and if you wisecrack while i'm talking i'll crown you with the inkwell.
dade?
is everyone here?
you remember when you called him that night? when you said goodbye to him?  he didn't say, 'don't get married, i'll be right down, we'll get married.'  he didn't say that to you, did he?
i don't like the word 'cheat.'
i wonder if you could help me.
i'll speak to someone.
nothing.
yeah, somethin' like that.  ok, now this is a nasty ass place. when you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. you got to maintain control. you following me? you lose it, you get hurt. now, you're my responsibility and i don't want you hurt. you understand?  ok, let's go.

i'll try hard -- i just can't take it all in.
because it's the truth.
then all you have to do is untrigger it.
it would be truer to say, i think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
m'god, i look twenty years old.  you have any weird dreams last night?
if jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
hey, vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
no really, keep talking, i ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...

hi.
if this is the age of ragnarok, keitel blacksmith, it is good to us.
it, john.  not him.  it.
if you said yes i would have had a reason.  you should let me redress those bandages.  before you go.
you're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
will you send me some cigarettes, please?  comrades, i am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the state.  you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. and you three comrades...
are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
well, to the law, you're an accessory.  before the fact.
why are you here?
...your ducts?
how?
it's the way they do things.
not so rough, honey.
can't you see it?
the traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. they got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
not good enough. you're the person who floated this amnesia story.  ever feel sorry for him? for what he'd been through?
are you girls talking about boys? practicing kissing your hands?
the country's loving it.
which they do.  and we're standing there. all the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an espn crew.  so i turn to her and sort of grandly say, "well, this is me, klutz, asking you, goddess of rock climbing, to marry me." and i took out the ring, and i don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  we're getting married in february.
well, i didn't want to assume.
where you been, man?  we got a celebrity!
senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
you tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  you put the killer in jail.  who won?
you're. acting. like your father.
you know where i can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? i'm buying.
you sound...ground up...?
chef -- since you're such a fan of miss december's i think you should be detailed with lance and clean to take the first drum up there.
okay - got light duty, three days.
okay. you read me well enough. why can't i read you?
. actually. i've been in twice.
[you only give information so you can fuck me.]
if you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. you wouldn't have bought this dress. you're hustling me, eddie. you've never stopped hustling me.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  this is a...why?  why would you do that?
no, no! i won't sign any pa- pers. you can't make me--
don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
you'd never get away with it. besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. it's christmas. there is one more option.
d'artagnan!
hey, look at him. tommy. you grew up.
it's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. i can't imagine what made you do such a thing. a reporter! of all things, a reporter! a barbarian who lets his socks come down!
hurry, sister!
aw, it's gotta be a typo--
i'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
let me comfort you.
that is not now, human!
columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
you tricked me.
i can't. i have nothing left to bribe with. can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
where are you going?
karen colcheck. from woodsboro.
then, how --
you told me.
you'll what?
no... there's a couple of things i'm still working on.
oh no...
they'll have surveillance on us. we'll know only at the last moment...
aren't you going to join us?
if we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
you sure?
cindy, i've been thinking about this whole friend thing. i never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... i mean, there's ray, but he cares for me in a different way. you know, bringing me flowers. running my bath water. and then there's nights i wake up screaming and i look over and ray's in my bed. holding me. and seeing that tonight might be our last night together, i was thinking...
you bet.  and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on carl's boat.
so the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
but, then, i don't have a choice.
just a humble perk from my dad's construction company or should i say deconstruction company?
oh for pete's sake, it's only a joke.
that's very clever. do you know any other poems?
beidermeyer?
wait.
it isn't safe, man. don't go splittin' us up. not with this one.
you're not saying what i think you're saying.  i can't believe you're even thinking it.
i'm talking about how much i'd like to take you to a laker game.
how can you be sure?
how are you?
if you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if i get a date or not?
i have no idea what i'm doing.
i was.
dead! you hear me?
the hotel.
it's my own design. you won't find another table like it in the world.
don't let it curl around you!
yeah.
i don't know.
i love this.  we're onto something really big.  i can smell it, ray.  we're going to make some headlines with this one.
what are you doing out there? are you crazy?
kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
ow! that hurt!
what are you going to do?
what's that?
i don't know. i don't know if i could live that way. what if, god forbid, you go to prison. mickey said jeannie's husband --
naw. they paroled me.
... movie.  that's your problem.  you don't want to be in love.  you want to be in love in a movie.  read it to me.
there you are, ted-baby. everything all right?
...but...
...no...
of all people.  now say the truth. do i look like che guevara.  c'mon.
is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  i don't think so.
but -- what's this?  i thought you were going along with me.
you don't know?  jesus christ! don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
will you two please stop it!  i don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
i think it's got something to do with my dad.
spock...?
unwelcome.
we'd be thrown out.
she's well, too.
tv repair?
security.
like after you've killed ... every ... last ... one ... of norrington's men.
don't shine me, verbal. no more stalling. you know what i'm getting at.
we thought it was an emergency.
so, what's up with you?  another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
i can see that.  why?
what's wrong?
you are wonderful!
keep 'em coming.
please.  filing a report will not help you find your car.
joanie orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with santo guerra.
might be exciting for you.
horses.
'joe...'
would you know where i might reach her?
wha .... ?
hi. nice to see you.
only in the emergency room or when he was well.
look, i bagged it last week.
what is this?
i don't think she's real big on hate.
football season's over, veronica. kurt and ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and a.i.d.s. jokes.
are you going to be alright?
kind of. i mean, john's like this kind of... craftsman. like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. but that's all he can make, and i don't need anymore tables.
not too big and not too small. what i'd call the typical room of an average man. or shall we say a little above average. now if there are any special aspects you wish to study i have nothing to conceal. just look around. that's my desk. those are my books, and here am i. where shall we begin?
tell egghead i said hi.  if you see him.
you knocked the fucking casket over, for chrissakes!
you must think i'm some kind of fool.
parochial school.  akron.  st. android's.
well, sometimes, some, uh...
oh no... this is a battle of nerves between john and me.
c'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
drink this! it will dull your pain.
what about them?
last night. when he called me over to your office to talk about it.
you're a teacher, eh?  maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, toddy.
drew, you're out of line.
well, it's probably nothing. i'm just spooked since... you know.
some bicarbonate - quick!
i want to see him tomorrow, clyde.
watch your tenses.
it's wrong to just let them go.
i'm going ashore to take a look around the island. there are some ruins up there...
maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
that's lednov!  we come along here.
you said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
who?
what?
excuse me, do you know if we've passed nostrand avenue yet?  excuse me.  look, i'm asking a simple question. have we hit nostrand avenue? i fell asleep.
don't i, norman?  you kept the fucking necklace.  of a woman you killed!
we're taking a different way home.
they call him "the sand spider".				*
what does that mean?
i ain't no more a preacher, you know.
the stuff we got last night.
what do you mean?
i recognize you.
what did he find?
okay. we're all here. today's wednesday. d-day is friday night ... that gives us two days to prep ... we're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... let's get into the vans --
the point is, they want a man inside.
these people play very rough. they don't want to lose this case. there's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, i...
what if he was?  do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
the point is -- i don't love your wife. i love your daughter, sir.
uh-huh?
a bit.
oh boy!
hey, scooby! how's it going?
listen, did i tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and clement?  let me tell you.  it's one of the funniest stories --
"half?"  what did you, take a nap in math class?  three people, three shares, one third.  four point six six six repeating.
don't, lee--that's dead.
don't you gamble?
well, not exactly. see, i met this girl. real nice girl. god-fearing girl. her name's sylvia.
almost four.
what did that man mean when he said you were... .?
no, we don't!  you're full of shit! you say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  my brother died over there last november.  why?  what good was his death?
it's all going to work.
what's a toby?
bottle-count.
that's a terrible thing to say.
maybe it's not connected yet.
nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
and speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy miss julie mcelroy.
“la collectionoose”. it’s about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. it’s on tv tonight and as i’m in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... the review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. and witty. the director’s supposed to be famous. rommel or something. french. you must know him?
what's that?
lee, this is special agent sterling from the united states secret service.
if we're going to virginia, why don't we drop by fort knox?  i can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the god damn cia.
i went on monday. but i spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
yes!
you sure you don't want to quit, friend?
you know you're really very good. i take back what i said.  i mean, you're really good.
i mean, i'm standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater. your girlfriend christine is in there.  she's all alone. everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  i've got my knife.
i won't let you do that. i shot the bastard. and i'm glad.
no. he wants him back. he'll be by tomorrow.
i flat don't like the guy, glory.  he's dirty.  and i'll tell you something else.  you want to know how old man lombardo lost his money?  he was fucked out of it by old man van ryan, on a little item known as the salt creek land deal.  it was after the war.  van ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  the freeway went to the coast, right where van ryan wanted it.
but it's hopeless! they can't go back and they can't go on. i tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
i've lost him -- where is he?
how much?
i don't know.  coach said i had to work on my 'ab's.'
i was grieving too.
he didn't call?
it's a .45.
make it twenty.
you.
what?
'cause you're too little.
i see you got the telegram.
are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
you changed the room around...
at least now you -- and i -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
that's half a movie, with holes in it. maybe forty minutes of screen time. you don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
likewise. and draw two for chasers.  now you're beginning to live.
so-called?
i have to tell you something...
what <i>is</i> this place?
i'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
we could've had three weeks in florida - all expenses paid.  lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
fuck you.
of course.
he is good. bur not as good as price.
so have i, actually... i wish it could always be like this.
i don't see no crowd around you, neither.
what do you want to know?  what difference does it make?  i'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  i make you feel good. you make me feel good.  what the hell else do you want from a guy?
i always thought i'd have a crack at this chair one day.
cross my heart and hope to die.
those are good burgers, walter.
how would you go about applying the golden rule, earl?
no, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
it's a shitty  song.
joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. he's a good kid. i understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. we're all real emotional. but you're barking up the wrong tree. i know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
then we'll open it in detroit or dallas or kalamazoo for god's sake! we'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
well--
look, man, i never met ruiz, okay? i don't know what the fuck i'm picking up, what the fuck i'm dropping off, who the fuck i'm meeting. all i know is maxie's still pissed at me cause i sold his fucking van.
yeah, well, you're not the only one. everybody i know has totally fucked up problems... it seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
i've never found someone really that i think i would like to go out with.
well?
i can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
20 bucks?
hello mrs steckler - we haven't seen you for a long time
you read russian?
so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
hey, do i look like a man?
take it easy, baby.
you mean quit?
the loran has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
who? some car hop, or a dress extra?
will you please speak to me! theo?
kirk here.
i accept. now get out.
... you can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... i don't know, what's the point of having it all. look at me. i don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam lyndon johnson!
like what?
what's your plan, mack?
you won't get much done with those people. those times are over! you ought to let me kick them out.
good work.  really.
let's open it.
i know more than i want to know about it. who's the father?
what's in the box?
sir, i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, i beg you to hear our plea. we are thermians from the klatu nebula.  our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by roth'h'ar sarris of fatu-krey. sarris wants the omega 13. we are to meet in negotiation. however our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. the flames, the death...  please captain, you are our last hope.  we have secured a limousine.
then why doesn't she?
we have a gift?
so do i. over and over.
since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
they are much more than that, sir.
what's wrong?
is that one hell of a kid?
...the people look like ants.
i guess i don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
i didn't mean it. i don't know what i'm saying. i'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. i don't remember doing it.
out where?
sooze.
sir, i've always wondered... why sue? you could have any woman in the world but --
your father's men are still looking for you.  they're still out there, circling closer.
something else we have in common.
sigmund freud?
joseph macdonald... your son.
how are you?
well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
go on. nothing can hurt you. remember, this is only a movie. you're completely safe.
then the emperor has already won. you were our only hope.
grampa... watch the language.
-- easy as that, huh?
show that to the station manager.  tell him leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
yeah.
if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in petrograd?
no.
you ever use the bathroom in kennedy?
you open?
terns... if i help you, clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. quid pro quo. i tell you things, you tell me things. not about this case, though - about yourself. yes or no?  yes or no, clarice. catherine is waiting. tick-tock, tick-tock...
he won't be back until monday. i mean, if those birds are for him....
~e're alive!
father!  thank god you're better!  i really need your help.  we've only got a few more hours.
what do you think?
i talked to her two days ago.
...t-thank you.
there's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
's okay. what do you think?
i think we should get out of here. it's going to rain.
is it done?
satellites.
that's ridiculous.
hey, sam, we're flat broke.
what can we do for you, officers? what new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
it was doom who killed acme, you know?
i had a witness disappear on me.
roy dillon?
better now than later.  we'll still be friends. i'm dying here.
yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
forget about leo's money, harry.
don't count on it.
i'll report you.  it's....
i was wondering -- could you tell me who i'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  just -- for the weekend.
before i forget, your father has papers in the basement i'd like you to go through. i wouldn't know what's important.
i'm okay. it's going well!
about her upcoming wedding and all.
come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
yeah.
did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
doesn't count.  you gotta say the words.
is there something wrong, sir?
do you really think so, andy?
how? what do they do for you, kaminski and his friends? they're all anarchists! traitors!
it's good to see you.
i cursed.
they bombed us, we're off the air.
couldn't it of happened on the fall.
if you grab a gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
get your clothes off!
sorry.
that's the general alarm. jesus! they musta got in!
where?
great, i really need a shower.
i thought you might want a drink?
how does that happen? you don't look japanese.
oh, yes, of course. but where are we going?
careful.
here i am, father.
mmm.
i did that on purpose. i don't have to miss.
can i ask you a personal question?
come on, we got to get this up. he's coming.
it's noise.
let me see it.
they want me to take the water of life... the truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these fremen.  i will try to pass within.
that's who they are.
do you have the file with you
you gotta get someone upstairs.
like the last time? how many people killed back then? how many kids?
house or apartment?
your eames table is incredible.  and the b&b.  i just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
i can't give you a lift back tonight.
when... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, i could not believe it.  i had to hide these... at least till i could confront him myself.
well i wouldn't. i would never say it if it wasn't true.
i'm still shaking.
outside!
why?
go to school tomorrow.  try to act normal.  don't let anyone know what's happening.  this is important. when the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
mm-hm. i'm a big girl. i can take care of myself. if i didn't want to be here, i'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for chinese food.
you didn't tell me that. i thought he already knew.
oh, fuck you...
i don't understand.
woman has taste....
jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
you sure?
it will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
it's ok.
one of the plagues on members of congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. get my son into west point--or *outta* west point. i've got a scheme to put people to work. how do i get rid of cockroaches? some woman's composed a hymn to replace the star spangled banner. want to hear it?
you told him. i'm fucking hurting here.
my mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
ah. sounds good. well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, i hope.
why --
your name's teddy.
every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. unkillable.  but now i believe that is going to change.
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
no, thank you.  i -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- i have this heavy date for tonight --
why are you mad?
you have a bay?
you could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
at sixty?
that sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on easter day.
it was the first time i had ever seen anyone shot.
well, we won't.
i'm going to kill him.
poor bastard never knew what hit him. jesus, i almost felt sorry for the guy.
whoa! didn't mean to scare you, evan. just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
hey, man, good to see you.
no women allowed.
yes, air.
wow. that shirt is working hard.
a twist ending if you will.
you and frank and cole, and even bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. you don't have to pay. they just look at me like i'm the baby brother.  don't tell anyone, okay jesse?
no.
no.
i need my case.  it's still in the back.
i ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
i didn't know you cared.
why'd you have to say fifty? why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
stevie, how's it going my man?  somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
you defend yourself admirably...
we're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
great movie. action-packed!
i don't know, conor.  it's not natural.  maybe something has touched you.
why attack russia?
you know what doris told me? she say: that duff's a nice guy. wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
you own this land.
cue the commercial!
she's the thing you had to tell me.
i got fifty dollars to spend in your store, jesus of nazareth. can you help me or not?
she's the one who controlled the horseman, isn't she, sir?  sir? 
no, ilsa, i won't let you stay here. you must get to america. and believe me, somehow i will get out and join you.
of course i know it's gone. you remind me every day!
let's talk to your husband--
the taphonomy sure looks that way.
your windows face south. northern light is the purest. but southern light is very good.
we'll grant that.
who would believe that elaine thompson was once a stewardess on the denver-chicago run.
those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
get'chu at that table up yonder.
get me major callaghan on the phone.
well?
what's wrong..?
other way around, sir.
rush your mouth, girl. no, he didn't. he cannot be that big of a damn fool.
that's my...
yes, it's so nice i thought i'd work outside.
four bits.
i have no wife.
does that mean we can't...
you mind your own bussines.
yeah?
...why, this is worthless.
so how was it?
you know -- based on what i've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this big parade.
no.
cool, huh huh huh.
and remember, rents: no skag.
hey ! what are you doing here ?
she came to us on the day of the dead.
no.
help me get him to the boat.
it's just not working out, but i'm getting my own place in the city... and i've got it all planned out. it's something i've wanted to do for a long time...
scotch, light on the water.
git up. i got sump'n to show you.
i'm not letting this list get out in the open.
i got a new car. only it's red. did you know mama died?
listen to this.  i have an alibi, i'm going to the como inn, why? why?  the place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  why?  because i probably did it.  are you going to turn me in?  george?  are you going to turn me in?
not again...
this business, captain?
these for me?
ah hell we can always do that. listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
tub - but i-tub - but i vol - love but i love ui - you. i love you!
easy, tiger.  come by after school. i'll leave darryl with the sitter.
well... yeah.  sure.
maybe you ought to buy me one.
that's all you care about.  you don't care about me at all.
i'm not saying that.
so you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... how did friedman say he got to know where to find me?
no can do.
four months?
massive subdural hamatoma.  we have to evacuat it - right now.
what d'you wanna ask, mr ross?
and i don't need sue ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
you're marrying again.
any priors ? any police record ?
then who flushed the toilet?
how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
i despise the job.
my change.
what?
no! no reply. remain on course.
she was eighteen years old! there were four of them. they stabbed her fifty three times! where's the fucking accident?! huh?! where is it?!
funny couple, ain't they?
you said, "apples aren't exactly flying."
what are you doing?
right here...middle of nowhere...
were you listening to the dude's story?
it ain't the truth. he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
you think i want a baby? when you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
sorry.
again?
it's gonna sound really bad, but i want you to know.
now that i'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
that's real big of you.
i don't remember that.
the map said to go left.
are you two all right? did you see that!? they left! we made it! i think we made it!
preach! go down and get me some white tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
i bet you he'd know how to say it all right. and me, i get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but i never get right to it. do you know what i mean? so the only chance i've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
then why can't i go in there?
where did he go?  he was just here.
otherwise.  i trust you know the difference.  you're an intelligent woman, finished at nyu.
uh-huh.
it's either a great white, or another killer whale.
i wouldn't worry about that.
shall we be all right?
yeah?
character.
is that so?
well he missed a great pot of stew!
rex. go away. i don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
he said if martin's interested, i could get a half a million for it easy. but don't worry, harry, i'm still giving you until friday.
you want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  it's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  besides, gondorff's still a hot item.  where am i gonna be if he gets hit?
damn, i'm proud of you, boy.  i wish i had a hundred ants of your caliber. the world would tremble.  now, time for some r and r.  you're invited to the royal victory party!
lie. that's one. keep going.
bye  that was snowball.
they've been ready for the last half hour.
well, i for one, am glad of a little diversion and i'm glad they're here...
i haven't been able to do that since i was a little girl.
yeah.
he's not in this building.
what are you doing?
sight seein'.
lyssa ...
oh, oliver, you're so tolerant. time for a coffee before you rush off?
you want me to be the bastard.
what is this?  don't be stupid man...
i done it again.
what do you want, nick?  flowers? i'll send you some flowers.
good afternoon, mr. harris.
but did she have the best doctors? wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
coming here?
no, man. hey. no, you know what? hey, it's you, man. it's, you know what, you know what it is? it's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. it's this cell. it's this void, you know.
okay.
governor dickerson? of florida?
really?  that'll be terrific for him, i think.
i know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
184  continued:
yeah.
that's right. that's what i said. you have a good memory. then what?
i don't know what to say.
well, good for you.
goodbye, dr. thurman.
hello? yes this is mrs. macneil. operator you have got to be kidding i have been on this line for twenty minutes.  jesus christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
klute, tell me, what's your bag? are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? or --
pardon me, but you can't do -- !
why are you doing this?
c'mon let's...
don giovannnnnnnni!
everybody! annie has an announcement --
i thought so.  he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
well of course he wants out of hell! the whole point of hell is that you don't want to be here!
but perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
you know, i've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
n-n-n-n-no, no, i du-du-du-didn't, i didn't!
milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. most don't have one.
come with me now, vincent.  you've gone as far as you can go.
jesus, it's too damn bright in here... like a goddamn spotlight... i'm goin' blind...
call me "sir," harold. first thing you learn in the army - an officer deserves your respect.
we made a deal with barrack one.
i saw it with my own eyes. we've killed an extraterrestrial and...
there are plenty of other safe places. why don't we go back to my flat?
ticket!  what's going on?
so have we!
will you marry me, loretta castorini clark?
what does that mean?
scottie, why are we here?
we know what you're up to, gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up bluestar.
splendid.  i'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though i have done some amateur stuff -- p.g. wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. i mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
you ever been married, mr. whale?
you killed my daughter.
michael, what are you doing?
and i'd end up a widow in two ways.  let's forget it.  i'll just be a little more careful next time.
you shaved.
my wife? what's she got to do with you?
motherfucker.  unsavory fuckin'... is there any way around this?
i suppose you're right.
otis!
your words, not mine...
because i'm planning on dying soon.
maybe you ought to see a doctor.
he called me chicken.
all right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
she's ... well, she's good.
not funny, huh?
...honestly...
maybe you shoulda killed him.
how long have you worked for the agency?
listen, i'm going to yell in a minute!
yes.
what's this?
just this morning. animal hairs were found all over the victims.
i want money.
daddy, can i have thirty five dollars?
i'm getting no sub reading, sir.
you gonna steal my truck?
mom liked it.
what's that mean, no employment certificate?
yes.
i'm afraid so. i spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
all right, thank you.  please ask him to come here.
anyone there?
come with us.
chris!
my skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...i wish i'd never met you, you ruined my life.
excuse me i asked you a question.
almost got it.
don't mind what?
hey!
no, fuck you. this rope is bullshit. i'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. must weigh 30 pounds.
oh yes, yes. and that was?
oh, kerry, this is monica.  monica, kerry.
yeah.
keep going. we'll tell you when to stop...
that would adversely impact my income.
this story is big huh?
no. but i have a hangover.
what do you mean?
nothin' will happen to you. you get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
dorothy!... dorothy!
i know that.
do you know where you are?
excuse me?
what were <u>you</u> trying to do? sleep?
i'm swell.
--and that he changed his will?
sooner... or later... i'll have to stop.
what's this guy's problem?
holy shit.
my wife is melvin udall's publisher.  she says i have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. what work do you do?
i'm gonna get you out of here.
how about you take your position?
it was laziness1 my whole breakup with avery. you know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." it's one of the great lies, right? someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
my dear francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
what she doin' in the van, man?
you can't think like that, baby. it's hard, i know. i've been there. not for six years, but i know. you just gotta get back out there.
you do know. try.
the homeless!
i can tell, can't you?
but...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
we're going to have the work hard. you'll need some excuse for staying out.  for your parents.
he claims?  powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? or some kind of nut case who --
jesus!
seymour! hello! what are you doing here?
my father was looking for the holy grail. did you kill him too?
i can try. is it comedy, or tragedy?
it's fine by me, jesse.
i mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. i don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
i never played a jewel thief.
-- yes, you --
but i understand you, mom. i always have.
right.
she's around. always is.
i know him. that's noel.
you carry a piece? you need one?
so he fooled you.
what's this?
you're right, will. any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
you're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. the problem is, what are we going to do?
good. then have a drink.
you may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
this'll pass.  everybody thinks like this now and then.  come to bed.
an apprentice for thirty years.  we've noticed your people's mental discipline. did that develop here?
i didn't think you'd show your face around me again. i figured you were humiliated. you did run away, after all.
it was snowing.
i know! i fuckin' know!
oh, i don't know.  smart people. creative people i guess.
alright, i'll stay. judge, i want to...
right.
i-i really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
and they grow out of our stomachs?
what happened?
oh, please.  i know what's coming, now.  "let me help you..."
you're twisted.
yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
now, you know where you're going?  down there, through those trees, follow the river.  you'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  willow, this is serious business.  don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a nelwyn.  give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
i don't know.     i didn't look.
what is it?
agreed.
we came from washington.
you're really crazy.
you don't have to be polite, clark. i've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
of course. this isn't a prison you know.  look if you'd prefer to tell me what happened, instead of a policeman --
you want me to ride down with you?
1998...?  this is wrong.  who are you? why are you doing this?
'magic fingers.' fifty cents.
on earth.
...the michelin commercial...
you did this? to yourself?
maybe a couple million.
fuck you. i hate the jews at least as much as you do.
could have been anytime.  anywhere.
what about those other guys you live with?
what are you talking about?
the engines!
i didn't hear it.
how do you know all this stuff about me?
he's so...it's too much...and i can't...i can't breath...
i don't think so!  just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood?
i was worried about you.  both of you.
what about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a sunday?
yeah... me you, too... i was at your house...
she's crazy.  you should have killed her.
he's still got a good grip.  we need to dig more.
this way lex.
i suppose so. he never told me about it.
you must be hugo.
from whom?
my name is whale.  this is my house.
yeah, yeah...  ...i like to fuck shit up.
i don't have to do what you say.
but she's right there!  i must feel her!
does he have the marked bills on him?
i looked.
who?
just get some people out of our house.
now, what do you see?
isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  do you have to rub my nose in it?
oh...do you know when she'll be home?
so, mark's working at the state department now.
rich? i haven't the faintest idea. why?
knock it off!
you can't!  we've come this far.  we must find them...
long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  i miss rorschach.  let's spring him.
so, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, george?
any luck raising ackland's party?
that's good.  get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  for the signs.
you are throwing me out.
may i speak frankly, mrs. mulwray?
what's all this about sin?
ahh, you'll miss me.
i wanna live at the beach someday.
emma, which is it--horace miller or henry hill?
i guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
there's a guy here on the task force right now.  maybe i should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
stop, stop, what was i thinking...out in the wilderness.  under the stars. i've ruined every--
jesus--i dunno.  you know.  what the heck.  who knows?
would you like to sit on my lap?
my mentor was an amazing teacher named benton mandlebaum. died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
sleep tight.
if i was smart i wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
and what if he's wrong.  if you were one hundred percent sure it was peter you would've arrested him.  if it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
did you have a good week mama. are they treating you all right?
vox...
is that yours?
hey. i didn't have the heart to wake you.
i don't hate you, jimmy.  but i have a couple questions that i wanna ask....
i want a huge cookie. and like, a lamb kebob. simultaneously.
let it go, baby. it's the past. i got a past...
i did, didn't i? i distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
you think it killed . . .  yeah, i guess not.
sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but i'm in the computer room, and i think i've located the malfunction. the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the emergency air lock. can't pinpoint it exactly, but i'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
and give you a good buzz.
my idea.  muchly.  my sketches. big heavy brow.  head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. everybody does things they regret. you just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. i'm telling you. you will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
when can i see you again?
casull .454 magnum.  you're talking twice the impact energy of .44 magnum hot loads.
yes. would you like me to walk a little way with you?
people die.
sora was sent to tell me i -- i must rake and cover the latrine.
is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
please.
kryptonite!
i already called for an ambulance.
dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. i had a good man -- an excellent man on the rue ponthieu, but h.q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
leave now.
congratulations.  unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and i really must insist you disembark.
are you my two o'clock?
help!
you know, stewart, you failed to mention that miss gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
cover.  it was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. no one was suppose to get hurt. the night you busted us...we were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. scare them away.
what a memory.
i bit the bastard's nose off.
why? just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
question withdrawn, you may step down.
father, are you okay?
he's not going to give us direct hints. he's going to skirt around it.
but i don't listen...then i'd be crazy.
do you care about me?
go ahead, mr. bartholomew -- i'm listening.
kay-em!
what?! how can you --  i'm sorry if my friendship with tom bothers you so much, but i happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what i say, it's wrong and no matter what i do, it's wrong... i'm sorry i'm such a disappointment to you.
we're ok.
he was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
not a floater.  only just dead.
i was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>i</u> killed it--
be at the state house, courtroom nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
but look at rites  look at this!  i'm a nun!  i'm invisible!  i'm a penguin!
i've had a--
krypton!
while they're strung out?
me?  are you kiddin?  you're the one! you were a hero, man.  they gave you a pardon!  and whadda you do?  you come back and fuck with your teeth!  wow!
don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? i mean, the woman gave birth to you. it's her fiftieth birthday --
ah, no!!! i don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
i'm going home.
you tired?
i think that's about the time i fell asleep.
howdy, mr. stone. we've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the grange?
i'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
i'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. somebody who wants me as i am will maybe walk into the place where i'm working and take me out of there.
you want her to visit you?  good! let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
more scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
for some sales pro...
i've got to make a stop in vegas, then i'm heading to santa barbara.
i have no intention whatsoever of hinting. your sister, mary, is a murderess. she killed irving august -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
i was the warden?
it's okay mom. i'm allright.
panes is here!
so... we get to shut down the neutron reactor?
just lucky i guess. how'd you start working for the bastaldi's?
how did you like toronto?
what have i done?
just a minute, mrs. lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. who's adam?
right -- want another one?
what?
those look heavy.  where's ian?
okay, gotcha. what did you think i was going to ask?
why couldn't he talk about that here?
yes! the only thing that matters is the grail.
i go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  nobody tells me about this, i have to find out, i have to go in, everybody's gone -
right... the suitcase was clinking. so what did you do with your clothes?
he sure is big, jack...
i can't keep my mind on the show.
maybe.  but there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
black capsule.
louder, pal, louder.
older, sillier.
it's too late for that.  she can't drive the bus anymore.  the school board saw to that right off.
it's true.  has to be said.  i got off to a slow start.
and you think this creature is one of them?
whew! that wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
fox, bud d. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. you're not hitting me up for nyu are you?
thanks... i'll... go say hello to your mom.
i want to thank you, mr. o'keefe, for this time.
and you know what that area is?  it's iraq.  iraq!  we're doing a little thing with them right now; desert storm.  maybe you've read about it.
i don't think so. their fix gave us the heads up and jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
how am i ever gonna get a girl?? i drive around in a garbage truck
what? what?
bud white, what brings you down to the basement?
i got married.
roma!  i'm talking to you...
you bastard!
even your play.
i don't think so.
charming, isn't she?
but i'm hideous!
tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, i dunno. but it affects my ear, i don't even know if i have tmj exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
no matter. kill away, mr. mcmanus.
what do that mean?
you said they've run guns, in their trucks. so they'll have guns. to do this robbery. they'll have serious guns.
never mind. i'm coming in to take care of business. how hot am i?
rain check me, partner.  i got something big going on tonight.
something like that...
--- what was that?
uh, no. i was gonna take a look now.
very good, mr._?
no, i'm on top of it...
character, hmmpf! that's your idea?
well? what'd you think?
what kind of information?
i spent a week reading sagan and watching re-runs of the twilight zone.  seriously.  i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- i had no idea --
daddy!
oh, no. he told you.
holy mackerel!
think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's ford. how's that?
on a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... a day so fair as forty springtimes --
there.
magruder's conked out.  adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  he may come out of it and he may not.  as a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
so what's so different about arcade? you guys've been talking about it for months.
this is our world you're entering.  you may see things -- feeding.  just remember why you're here.
i'm going to miss old annie. pop, i think i'll get dressed and go over to harry's party.
he's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  we heard from doctor hudson?
probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
she was in here when it went down.
my mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
i know what you're saying.  doesn't pay very well.  depends on the woman i marry.  maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
tell her i'm very happy with it.
i said, ask your wife.
ya know, i used to fuckin' hate airports.
why don't you answer the man, sidalee?  he's trying to take you off the hook.
hot dogs?
but it's on the water.
no -- that's for me to do.
i am a starfleet officer.
you're early... it's not ready. what happened?
she was good in bed, though.
i was faking it.  i've been feeling caged for sometime.  funny, huh?
i'm bored, and so are the kids.
maybe we should ask jessica to join the class.
lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  ricky tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  victoria harbor.  if you don't want to...
i'm gay. like you didn't know.
pull on your works. your privates.
his parents.
are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
i loved you, madeleine.
i know my rights.
he's very human.
it's natural.
a "z" and a "k" in the title. that would draw the eye. for the poster. i like that the prisoner of zenda had a "z" and a "p" and that worked--
life's too slippery for books, clarice. typhoid and swans came from the same god.  tell me, miss west virginia - was she a large girl?
this is a sign! someone's coming to take buzz away from me. i don't know if you're the guy or what, but i'm not letting it happen. i'm leaving him first.
you know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
it's your grass.
you...
hey, you still here?
yes. i can't help the way i am.
yeah.
he is fine.  and we know the jokes. when it gets vengeful, things get messy.  when they get messy the wrong people die...  everybody gets it.
oh, somebody else sitting there?
no wonder you jumped in the river.
yes...
what if?
don't you think it's about time it became important?
if you really want to do this... plan it out.  rest up.  train for it.  build up your body.  plan every stop along the way.  how much money?  time?  really do it properly.  this is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
seymour?

no.
where were you for the last hour? i've been lookin' for you?
ummm . . yeah. luis is calling me tonight. i need to be home for that.
fuck this shit!
maybe she wanted a free trip to la. maybe they offered her money. massey is very seductive. who knows.
i'm hungry!  where's my dinner?  who ate my dinner?  huh?  who's in trouble now?
carlotta valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
ellie? what's wrong?
master safety.
you're worth every last penny.
i do.
no, the, uh, police chief of malibu. a real reactionary. . . so your father. . . oh man, i get it!
do you know what he's talking about?
it's dark in here.
she got off, huh?
have you ever done anything like this before?
well, who can blame them, sir?
nope.
fuck! what do you want?
no!  no!  she's alive!  we have to --
breaker there, earl.  what do you want us to do?
how someone strong like you scared from a message? is good news i sure!
want to sit down? did you need somethin'?
sir, i understand what you're doin', but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
you're good.
see how easy it is? perhaps miss mayfield left her door unlocked. or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. the head porter has a passkey. the bell captain has a passkey. the hotel's full of passkeys.
adrian, you really look great, y'know -- but i can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
there's no need to be afraid, sire.
the taste of defeat is bitter, no?
praise jesus.
sheila, you're going to far! those are your children!
okay.  forget it. 
my partner...
well, then there's only one thing to do.
look... i don't know what your problem is...
mr. kramer?
eleanor, how was the drive?
night. i'm going to stay with you.
but who is he?  what are his creden- tials?  what is his relationship to you?
and you're not as we imagined you.
that cop didn't pull his gun.  mars lied. he just started shooting!
i'd like to wait for justice zinnowitz, before i commit myself.
no.
hey, what'd you do that for?
we did it!
landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
what? ... oh ... 
just being happy? just stopping all this nonsense about eve - and eve and me?
those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. they were executed at close range. that one there is a police officer killed by the mohawks up in canada more recently.
go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. you got all that?
what's wrong?
we do know that.
just...say...no.
in braids? that's right.
yeah.
yeah, go on...
serveza yourself!
did you tell her?
yesssss...
no, it's, uh... a real big favor.
how strange you are! when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused. you seemed almost offended. and now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. thank you, my child!
permission denied. if you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  i need you at my side. now more than ever i...
no, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? the bad as well as the good?
i wonder if you might give me a ride.
well, it's not called the horn resounding for nothing.  you do know how to play the horn, don't you?
we ought to kick their asses anyway. even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
"mr. lovejoy".
we need weapons.
he's liable to shoot you.
i thought you dumped her for me.
two days, we got two days! don't do nothing. don't touch nothing --
i need this one.
nick's going?
well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
those are white words, not ours.
'tis he.
wouldn't you?  you're laughing!  i was sure you never laughed.
well, i hope you know what you're in for. i'm a very dangerous person. someone does me bad like you. if i caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead ratso long about now. hear?
he got a little jealous.
will you leave me alone?
it's in the suburbs outside havana.
god... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  strange, i don't seem to remember seeing him at agincourt.
oh jesus!
well, that ain't fair to her.  a single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
what pills?
sonofagun! look at this here!
i can't just walk in and take my clothes off. it's embarrasskin.
hadn't even opened the thing since cub scouts.
okay, thank you for asking.
confidential, like.
the report king bought. it’s a manual. renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
dr. singer. it's been a long time.
what've you got?
it’s about the puppy. you got the money?
sir, your limo's here.
don't you think i would've done it if i wanted to? what can i do to make you relax, baby?
annette? she's good... tense.
i just have to do one little thing.
none of you know anything about it. now go.  and andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
agree to work with me?  you don't like me... you don't like any of us. you have nothing but contempt for us.  and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
sid.
grace!
apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
morning, darling.
i said play!
sure.
you came up here on a hunch, miss crane? nothing more? no phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
i didn't count the days.
well, he isn't.  nice...real nice.
that's an eyeball!  oh, god!
'as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, i resolved to make the creature of a gigantic stature.' of course!  that would simplify everything.
wayne---
we're all professionals here, miss ...
i'm fine, babe.  i'm gonna take a little walk.  i need a minute.  let's forget it. my life didn't pass in front of my eyes. so, it probably wasn't that close.
when did you two talk this over?
the entire wing?
guess.
time to go.
so we'll get egg nog.
why not? there's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. i don't see why i shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
just how serious is it, doctor?
yes, miss ratched...
i wouldn't pay jesse no mind at all. she's just a crazy old woman. hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  wasn't much right before that, neither.
he didn't come back here?
what sort of thing?
landing zone is extremely hostile. come down on this transmission !
a divorce lawyer. a custody lawyer. you know, 'cause of jill.
did i promise that? i don't remember that...
could you drive me somewhere?
investigation of what?
thanks.
sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
michael, yes, we was all relieved...
let me know.
visitors? some friends maybe? someone you talked to?
what?
we have to do something before she tries it again!  i beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
we want to talk to ya about henry gondorff.
the standard ten.
where is your mother?
madame vice president. we have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off lee, and reads it as she talks.
you're so scared.
look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. i don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. and i don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. you notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
i'll cover them from the top of the casement.
are you fucking nuts? that was forty, fifty thousand.  i need it. i was depending on that money.
your mother will be down in a few minutes, judy--
i hate him.
yeah...you've fallen for her.
i don't know doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
have you lost you lost your mind ? i'd rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life.
that's why you're so perfect.  you have something i don't have.
with the same friend?
grow up, johnny. you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
hello, sandman.
countess. i'm really in a dither. she's turned my head.
who are you?
the ropes are coming loose.
well, he didn't give it to me, and when i ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to berthier.
why don't you leave him alone?
calm down, calm down. shh!
i thought i did.
and you didn't try to find out who?
but not right away? first the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
cool it. we got business.
he could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always gray -- gray to hound him to his death.
maybe, but i don't think so.  i think it's just a tease.
shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
wes, do me a favor.
christ, will you look at your hair?
you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
by hand. like the pioneers did.
i'll just take a minute.  deborah ann kaye.  you know what i'm talking about.  the case is going to trial. our chief witness is a dr. david gruber, you know who he is?
oh, god!  oh god!
it depends.
well, folks, what's the plan?
bye.
if you went away, what would become of me?
lamar, i'm sorry.  i don't know what --
what?
you'd think they'd build the parking lot of america to go with the mall of america!
that's it. dyke's auto camp.
the fleet is finally breaking up. i'm hoping they'll follow standard imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
did you not enter this country illegally?
late again, eh?  you haven't been on time once since this war started...  get out there and fight... 
i'm not your boy.  i don't like you.  i got no choice but to do business with you. let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
no, seriously.  we used to shoot pool together in rangoon.
not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow.
great, send him to the marines. this guy's not a negotiator. he'll quit in two weeks.
my compliments.  i'll take care of them from my share.
that's the whole point. it's all in my head; it's right here.  i just got to get it out there. tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  it's beautiful.
don't call them that.
danny, tell me what you're thinking.
front. use your teeth.
yes, i do, will.
i did. since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
look, baby, i've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  you're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  and you will.
brian, he's coming around!
there is no pocketbook here... on the floor probably. 
is that you. d?
magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  it is still bright. only when it is red, then it will be buried.
i've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
she's good enough for me! and if i was to go home and tell my wife --
didn't you see <i>raiders of the lost ark</i>?
listen to me, you thankless little prick.  we're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. what the hell is it, this captain? because i'll see him in a rowboat...
was she married or something?
i'm still going in.
would that work?
steve said you were thinking of leaving. true?
accident.
i didn't know it was a hit.  i swear to you i didn't know.  johnny ola contacted me in beverly hills -- said he wanted to talk.  he said you and roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if i could help them out. they said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
solved the whiteman case with this.
i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year.
maybe you can look after me a little.
here and there, scooter? here and there like boston, chicago, houston? the bay area? some action in london, 'til it turned nickel and dime. or how about that little stint down in miami? heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there. you guy's pretty good?
no, it's not that simple, dave...
and then you'll leave her out of it?
a ray of oneness piercing the solitude. falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. you'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
you know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
what's that you're playing?
this does not help us, johns.
i came for my clothes.
price didn't make the guest list... the house did. it wants vengeance.
yeah, i'm here.
you didn't...
jackie shawn.
father, i don't understand. tell me what happened?
so do i.
how prominent? what kind of placement?
what do you think?
here.
jesus, come on!
he commands it whether he exists or not...  look, we can fight him and be crushed. or we can submit.
i advise you to let us go.
are you okay? i thought i heard screaming.
hello, inspector--i hear your vacation's been spoiled. somebody lost a bracelet.
mr. kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
we're not coming out.  we're not letting you in.  get out of my house. 
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
excellent. thank you.  give them to crealock, would you?
did something happen to make you care about reality?
we have to close that down, just briefly. security reasons.  someone with that access has been tampering.
hey.  i'm sorry.  about logan.  i was jealous.
what's this?
you're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
yeah that's it.
here we are.  rembrandt's drawings. edward hopper. van gogh's letters.
i need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
got one. just pulled up.
... aye sir...?
you wouldn'ta jumped.
i got an awful toothache.
what was i saying?
leave me alone.
give up, castor.  people are going to find out.
you told me to look, so i looked.
not really...
hey freddy, what's goin' on boy. i seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
i didn't know which side you were on.
that idiot!
adrian.  what are you doing?  why wouldn't you let us in?
that's right?
you should have heard her play.
alright, we know who we're looking for.  play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules.  in the myth, bellerophon killed chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  i think nekhorvich has created a monster virus in chimera and apparently the means to kill it in bellerophon.
... oh... god...
chevalier, though i cannot say how, i believe you have cheated me.
you saved my life.
don't get mad, louise, but where are we going?
i still owe you an essay from last week. is there any way i could get an extension?
silly?   silly am i?
you know what would be great?
no one saw me but the italian and a dog. i blew up their generator. they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
what? what have we done?
you may not realize it, miss kubelik, but i'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
those trees were very young when i first arrived.
jesus.
well, i, i really like that.  i think that's a pretty color on you.
the queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
jake, you are never out of your head!
bent?
what is it?
tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
eddie?...  you owe me money!
you're not doing the extra credit problems.
so.  my way.  no mi-6, no interpol.  just you, me and my people.
i'm red this time.
of birds?
calvin webber! what a thing to say!
make yourself at home, mister mcmurphy...
you know the answer to that.
what about the guy you lobotomized...did he get a refund?
it's a carpet cleaning company...
listen judge, oakland's panther international headquarters. we shut the pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean anything.
not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
zuzu petals.  sounds like a drug. a lethal one.
it's working!
you know me. i love it up here. how about you?
hello.
this is june twentieth?
whattaya mean?
now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
come on. the guy is a pipe dream. this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
do i!?  momma!
what do you mean?
in this hatchery? forty to fifty.
do you know how much i love you?
ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos? that's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  careful of these tiles, they're slippery. valentino used to dance here.
you really like that bitch don't you? i gotta tell you, i was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. you know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. but, if you're into her... that's cool.
hello leonard!  beautiful morning, isn't it?
yyess.
i'm so humiliated.  i don't know what to say.  i mean--
catholicism is not on trial here. i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
no.  it's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
does she know anything about this?
never show mercy!
let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in philadelphia on june 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
we should be dead.  we didn't decompress.
or get eaten alive.
why would you do that?
toy wit' this will ya.
uh, we're just, starting our program...
but what can we do?  our guns are useless --
that was two words.
good song though.
answer the radio zebra. you know it's that time.
i...i can't explain it.  it's just something i feel.
she's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
i get it--lee lother have a hand in that, too?
i know. i know it all. save your strength. i already know everything you're going to say. [beat] you're in the jacket right now, aren't you?
you're wrong.
as you can see i am a new man, just like you.
does it?
how do you know that?
i am well, admiral.
where is the glucogen?
in a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd, dragged her to a vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
i want my paycheck.  by the end of the day.
nudie pictures, what do you think?
oh, that's too bad.
it might have been her mother.
yessuh.  joseph knights printshop. vacant for thirty years.
must be.
things have changed. circumstances, jerry. beyond the, uh... acts of god, force majeure..
hey, kat.
hear you had a little trouble, quintero. defective fuse?  well, you're all in one piece. so what's the beef?
have you ever been on television?
would you rather i not smoke?
i should have known... once i would have... i used to be wary... and today i watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and i damn myself for having let her...
i wanted to tell you my plan.
michael, it's wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on su...
way out of anything, man. just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm will turn. how many days you short?
adam canfield. wonderful. do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? i don't even know who i'm talking to any more.
when i have children, i hope i don't hide behind them.
don't be sad, barry.  you'll find true love someday.
may i presume to ask you a question?
rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. what's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
you still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
not exactly. well, i mean, yes. yes and no.  hollis felt the public should own the water but i don't think my father felt that way.  actually, it was over the van der lip. the dam that broke.
shape, nothin' -- they're afraid. they know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
what do you mean 'we...?'
yeah, right.
someone left last night.  looked like they headed to the square, but i lost them in the forest.
from the beginning...
and then what happened?
well, yeah, but --
atmospheric turbulence.  dust storm.
no, listen to me. you gotta let me bring you in.
i questioned the maid, and she admitted charles had been madame bonaparte's lover for several months.
something we did changed the case...changed history.  mom wasn't dead.  but then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  and this guy, this nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
perfectly absurd.
i sure wish superman was around. he wouldn't let any of this go on. not for one minute.
some people fall apart in a pinch. but you shine.
hi, dad.
diane, maybe you didn't hear mr. silverberg. they've got models that'll try on the garments.  thank you, sir.
i don't know. please...
you are a happy man oliver. you have but one world to live in —- the world of today. i have two worlds. i have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which i was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
asteroids!  chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
before you.
and her husband? what was he?
none of your business. or mine for that matter. i got nothing more to say.
yeah, i know what your saying. and i'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
no, no, no, no, no. what do you mean? it doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
we are. and it's winding down.
we did let father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
about jessica.
maybe we should make the time. especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
hello bud.
do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
they feel cheated.
well, at best you might deny it.
i want to publish this. i've got to. i think they'll let me. with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
wydell.
it all went so fast.  he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  i only wanted to defend myself.  you have to call the police...
it's beautiful. where'd you get it?
you're late.
so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
i'm turning off the alarm.  i'm turning off everything.
it's my daughter! go after her.
what do you mean?
what's that?
i'm not at the top of the empire state building.  i'm here.
but if it got late and i hadn't shown up?
what's he in for?
i'm not really dressed for a party.
yes, but that's an added service a firm like cedar, cedar, cedar and budington usually donates.
oh, i can explain about that later. you're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
thanks for helping with the bag.  it looks great!
well, i guess -- that's what he said.
where're they headed?
that's not the question.  it's over.  do you think that it's my fault?  if i'd...if i'd...i never should have taken it.  there was no way that i was going to win.
good. that's an honest answer. and why don't you like coming here?
a wife knows.
where are we?
you sure this is where it was?
tell them to come on in.
it's a miracle.
it's a little late for that.
what are you doing here?
maybe.
it's a juice and coffee bar, man, like i been tellin' ya --
the man is a sex offender.  with a record.  spent six months in chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
you'll get ich killed.
just give me another chance, norville -- i can help you fight this thing. i know this last story was a lie! we can prove it! we can --
i'll call them from the road.
you fight it cut.
i don't know.  maybe.
yes, sir. what is it, sir? anything happened3
what'd he say now?
shhh. they're coming to the cubic zirconium.
the missing piece of the jigsaw. i tried to get you to give it to me as peter; i tried to steal it from you as dr. darling. as myself i'll be a bit less subtle.  with this ring my plan will be complete.
all right. the check will be certified. want my fingerprints?
where is that?
that is my permiso.
i know what i look like.
i ain't your partner, i'm your manager. i'm managing to get your money out of mexico, into america, in your hands, and i'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. that makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
wait a minute!  what the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
hold your son high. 
i'm sure i wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
pity. i was growing fond of mrs. peel. unfortunately --
you know him?
why is that?
this is the worst night...
now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  all you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, ellen.'
that's so typical, isn't it?
let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
yeah.
boy, that's nice...i wish we could all deal with each other like this. i'll check it.  anything i can do for you?
dr. winkel?
i can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
hey, dennis?  can i let you in on a personal secret?
don't look at it!
not really.
i went to see a friend of mine.
bunny, not you too?
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too.
great. now, what do you want to do about it?
c'mon, it all worked out. you came out okay in the end...
and don't be walking off with any of that. you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
that's his lawyer.
to be quite honest, mr denham ... i find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
each show is worse than the next.
well, i changed the ending a little.
so, you gotta be a little flexible. look at your brother and me. larry's not perfect, neither am i.  but we work it out.  we're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  i think you've got the door number three syndrome.
i'm really not that hungry.
your brother was a client with our london branch.  we do a sort of informal scoring.  his numbers were outstanding.  sure you're not hungry at all... ? tung hoy, best in chinatown...
but it's all right, isn't it? you were able to arrange everything?
i w- i was gonna be back before she woke up.
that could be a serious accusation, rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
ok, i will.  the bad news is the ship is history.  life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
evacuate manhattan? that's over three million people. has that ever been done before?
i could be her.
in a way. at least now i have some idea of what was happening. if we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... i don't know. maybe it'd clear things up in my head. i'll tell you something, jez, honestly ... i thought they were real.
feels awful good. yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
no time like the present.  the car will bring you.
no, don't go...
look--we appreciate it. we really do. we just--we want to go home now.
...her face is careworn.
my dinner.
this vacuum don't work.  where's the restroom?
mr greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. he really does. marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. we hope she never knows.
um... yes. we've been caught in a blizzard!
if you only mean to dupe me again --
she'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
i know what you're gonna say. a man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. how many times you gonna say it? she's my mother, you know. i oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
but all men like me, lois. i'm very rich.
gentlemen--that's nice.
rheya...
i know.
i don't carry it with me.
a huge law firm.  okay?  they put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'you must drop by with pat and me...'  okay...?
we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs. feur.  what's her first name?
hi...do you work with my aunt?
i understand.
mm-hm.
now he's the one who's locked up and i'm the one who's free. if i gotta do this alone, i might as well start now. she revs up and peals out.
and i kicked ass.  my best stuff.  then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and i cried.
i thought you said you could handle him.
i hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
are you all right?
there were so many times i didn't think i could last another day.  i can't even tell you some of the things i thought about.
i think i lost a week's salary at the dart board.
i screwed up twice, sir.
the great spanish bullfighter
what do you suggest?
well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
you would not leave me?
can you get me that ring back?
what can i do for you?
i know.
five minutes.
c'mon, rebecca, you wanted it. now get up there. ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. c'mon, now.
not exactly, sir.
mm-mm. i never knew him. he died before frank and i met. this here's...  frank and tom's mother and father... there's little frank and tom...
what do people do in the afternoon?
i'm sorry. we don't.
he's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my english is better.  this way... so you're from new york eh? i love those hill street blues...
golly, i hadn't thought of that.
here -- here it is. here's your pocketbook, kringelein.
look, i've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
lucky thing, my running into you. just the man i need.
wasn't your fault.
i tell mine that they're little men. i tell them they're strong. they make me feel joy. i let 'em know. so they really know that i need them just as much. you know. just as much man. and you know, you're their godfather...
all right.  so who stands to gain if jordan flames out in a big way?
hawk, hawk, hawk.  enjoying italy?  i always had a soft spot for rome.  did my first barehanded strangulation here.  communist politician.
hey. you ok?
the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
sir, before you boot me, i just want to explain.  i mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
i don't know, i'm just so depressed. everything is just so... depressing.
get ready.  to get <u>really</u> mad.
right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
yes!
what?
oh god, bruce, you were a child. you weren't responsible.
what choice do we have?
the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
...the copa, in new york...
you hated being alone.  couldn't stand it.  busy every minute.  always plugged into something.
keep painting.  promise me.
the mother is in florida visiting her sister.  the father works at home, so he's probably inside.
morpheus believes in you, neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  he believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
you know, i was the one who created hell.
what friends?
i'll look around and catch up later.
well claire do you?  have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
that's right. that's why foreplay is better than sex.
look here, roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  the girl will marry best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  you are but a boy.  best is willing to consider you as such.  dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  make best an apology, and be off.
you're intolerable today.
huh.
so who are these people with the boss ?
i noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. i guess i deserved it. i've been thinking about my three year plan and i think it's unworkable. i must have been delirious.
i have to stay.
you don't want to give away all your books.
i only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
not a specific day. what's this about?
you were not dead before. when i thought you dead, i did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that i would never see your face. i saw our end, and it will come.
general -- we have to talk sometime!
i admit, getting it back makes me realize how much i'd missed it.
let's get the hell outta here.
the shadows suit us, frost. we've existed this way for thousands of years. who are you to challenge our ways?
i think  it's worse  now.
out of the stew pot and into the fire.
dad--
do you know me?
what kind of words?
how do you say nineteen?
i don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. if you said he was still at lunch i'd believe you. incredible. the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
i'm going to ask you one last time and if i don't get an answer, i don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. where's my chest, jessica?
don't mind lovey. he's got the misery.
do it, and i'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
don't you know anything about limo etiquette? everything in here is included for our pleasure.
would you shut the fuck up? you hear what i'm doing?
way i see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
they know.
--don't concentrate on segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
what was that?
once warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. it's a completely brilliant plan!
sunday, but...
are you coming over tonight?
i'm telling you. can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! they come rollin' out like oranges!
you know as well as i do that it was made to look like he was lynched. now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  we're gonna call domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  we're gonna eat it in bed.  we're gonna veg' out and watch television.
you understand that we have lost all contact with captain kirk...?
afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
then where is it?
i take out the garbage.
um, uh, butt... um, hole. butt-hole...
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. may i have a drink of water? right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
what do you want, jim?
i think it's called silicon. charlie told me that.
i'm leaving in the morning.
mom, this is a farm.  we've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
...see you tomorrow night.
what's wrong with me?
no.  we decided that we're friends.  i mean, i know it's a terrible word...
he feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
when was the last time?
that'll keep you busy.
hey, schulz! i got a deal for you. suppose you help us escape. we'll go home and have everything ready for you in madison square garden. for the world championship! schulz, the beast of bavaria versus halitosis jones!
'phillips head,' right?
i'm all right, mom. i'm not in siberia, you know.
good luck.
mr. keating? sir? oh captain my captain.  what was the dead poets society?
you know? and it used to scare me so much that i didn't know what was coming in my life.
yeah, they could be songs.
spider rice.
what makes you say that?
where?
try some other ways.

thanks, kid.  where are you goin' now?
the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? you've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
death! thank you!
well, this lot is full!
what time?
that is not true. they have tried to help me.
what do i do with it?  nothing.  it's for peace of mind.  it's for the principle.
aren't you going to take the pills?  they'll knock that headache out.
hi.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? you think <u>i'm</u>...  ... gay?
if you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.

how you erase this?
oh, jim!
objection! these remarks are profane and irrelevant.
keep her together until i get back.
sorry, that's my son and the nanny. i had the calls transferred to my home so i could go over your stuff.
long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
what plan?
it's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. you don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. and then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
do you think guys find that attractive?
could you repeat the last part of what mr. marsh said to you the day before his death?
i never scared anyone before.
tell me about that job in alexandria, dave, the big motel you're building.
i'm free to do what i want?  and you think i would want to go with you some place on a plane?  where? where ya going?
oh no. i have no plans.
yes! it is! the paper's cheap, the type's too small --
i'm done.
i went with sandy and vera. salvy was there.  stop it. i just had a drink, that's all. i didn't do anything wrong. 
pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  they better be fast.
he just may be nuts enough.
no.  i want to show you.  is it ruined?
but she couldn't handle it.
yes, i do, mr. gardner.
relax. let me handle this.  you'd make a piss-poor lawyer... room 1600, please.  as your attorney, i advise you not to worry.  take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
what is it with you man, what the hell is it?
where's the bloody -
...yes.
for the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
i'm leaving.  i'm taking the kids and i'm leaving!  i won't stand it anymore.

i'd get down if i were you. they may be up there now.
your kid dropped it off.
of course i am.
done.  bring it to me in london.  i want it by the end of the week.
what's the scoop, ace?
apparently, drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
you know how i feel about her.
i wanna see jamie lee's breasts. when do we see jamie lee's breasts?
yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "devil got my woman" -- i mostly just keep playing that one over and over... do you have any other records like that?
you believe in the bible?
and that's all?
they'll be all right. i'm surprised they lasted here this long.
we already played that game. you lost, remember?
sandy? ...sandy, please.
a couple...?
what do you want to live in a black neighborhood for?  motherfuck gentrification.
see you, miles. you take care.
i don't think i'm gonna take it.
i was mistaken.
uh... i can assure you, mister daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
god, i hate falling asleep in the afternoon. now i'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
i nuttin' to do wi' dat.
what about the future? you planning to rock the boat at all? stir things up in "heaven?"
what do you want with my baby?
where's positano?
guess "please" would be a stretch.
suck my crank. fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  so, when are you done with those meetin's?
he was a local legend back in the '70's. there was a song, stagolee kinda deal: "this is the ballad of jimmy bones/black as night and hard as stone..."
to major burns' tent. yes, sir.
do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created!
on the high seas, your ship attacked, and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners.
it's me sir.
what's the award?
mr. clear moon.
i want you for my roommate.

i told you you could do it.
it was.  it was.
you said there are advantages to being single. i want to know what the advantages are.
it's all there.  both nights.
well, thanks, i - uh—  how do you do? what is your name?
you "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  typical.  what does this virus attack?  don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  have i ever "developed" a virus?  do i put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? do i inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  wow!  and i'm crazy!
no, don't guess i do.  scooter, good to meet you.  this is him, the one i talked to you about on the phone. now like i said, i'll understand if you get nervous about it. i'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
i don't blame you... this is a monumental first day out... you sad or anything?
augie's going to grow up here. there's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
what happened to those disks i gave you, have you still got them?
janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
ah, dear simple otis. albert explain it to him.
come on, guys ...
that took guts.
tactically dangerous.  we lay low.
get ridda her. this is money inna bank.
the guy might not have been carrying anything.
paramus... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably program assist routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
i'm your psychiatrist.
i am not going to look at any more pictures.  they're like a disease. they get into my head.  i can't get them out.
hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
...don't you?
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
what?
am i... disturbing you?
are you makin' fun of me --?  this is ridiculous!
i'm going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission.  jean, can you raise me up there?
yes, sir, i yield for a question.
go away.
i guess we've never been introduced proper. jake mckenna.
he's stopped.
yeah.
... do you know who i am?
i know. and that's great. but it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if i could find him and bring him back.
we'll keep talking.  until they get here.  then... 
because i enjoy interviewing women more than men.
you're late.
a what...?
considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
where are you going?
i mean, i guess you still think about nam. right? i mean --
yes, and i'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i.a.s. convention.
the police called us.
very professional.
why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. and that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
it's his work.
you can't even give me that?!  what were you gonna do, jack?... just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  what were you planning to do, jack?
it's nick! i know that guy. i know him!
what's the word on the chairs?
another reason??? did i miss something???
polo.
my son --
the matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. you can see it out your window or on your television.  you feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
what's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
oh, you want to stay now?
what was that?
you want to come with us to a party at the chateau marmont? they got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
who is it?
what the hell are you guys getting at?  i make horror films, that's what i do.  the studio came to me with 'stab'.  they came to me, check it out.
what little studio?
in a holding cell.
-- closed.
c.r.s.  who do you think?  jesus h., thank your lucky charms.  to think what i almost got you into.
want to come out?
it stinks, you goin.
hey, look -- we've known kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in big bear. remember?  you and edie banged the wall so hard, me and carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
we're in no hurry. i think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
friend?
i think she really likes you ... where's mrs. peel?
after all this shit tonight, i know for sure now you regret not running off with me to hollywood!
shelly's already told me all about sex.
different.
who am i?
uhura?
yes, he's fine.
i don't understand.
here you go, buddy.
all right. name it.
would you rather leave?
i can take care of myself, jeffrey.
it seems that the english care more about you than the french.
extract of pineal!
if simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
vaughn.
well, think.  because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
oh it's just a rental. i'm moving to the east side soon. i've got a couple of deals brewing with gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? like dinner. the two of us. friday. cafe. santo domingo.
i don't think so.
but there's one thing i envy you for.
naw. never did know too much of nobody. not to he'p me out anyway.
i don't know.
because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  because, god help you if something happens to that dog?
you can't do what?
why?
industrial refuse.
i found verdell, mr. udall.
they don't want me up there. every time they look at me i remind them... if they thought about it, they'd want you. bur all they really want's the boy. and they'll take you.  but they don't want to see me...
oh, i can't stand it.
why did you call me?  the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you.
i've got to get moving. terry will bust my chops if i'm late. see you in september, auggie.
who will it be? put your mind to it, then.
but you're looking better, it has to be said. healthier. radiant even.
figures.
you're also a human being, frank.
we're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the grateful dead!  sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
gee, uncle lex, i don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
uh...
well -- thank you.
what do you think?
you almost got into trouble back there.
yeah, this is ronny.
at our press conference tomorrow, i think we should announce our plans to explore the world. not just a few leggy 36d's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
hey juno... a couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
the problem is the by-product created by the process.
how big is it?
he's coming! he's going to hurt me!
how in the world did he get shot?
yes, well, i think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  i'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
officer, i killed those people last night.
drove into superior?  what for?
plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. that still leaves what?  around ten thousand?
...where is the back end coming from?
christ, that's twice in...when did they move in?
mmmmmm. root beer float that sounds good.
but your goal is so hard to reach. do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  we would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
i was hoping you'd say that.
you wanna know what i think?
he's on the list.  if he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. he's on the list.  you can't have him.
just goes to show you.
bullshit, you killed him.  not me. you did it because you couldn't stand the thought of johnnie fucking you.
yes, will. i didn't even know that?
is there a mr. macaulay in the house?  oh, it's you.
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
why yes, bill, i was saying to quince --
what is it?  what's going on?  where are we?
the medieval philosophers were right... <man> is the center of the universe... we stand in the middle of infinity, between outer and inner space. and there's no limit to either.
ma'am?
did you hear that?
why didn't you tell me?
know what my next move is? no more cigarettes.
what's she so emotional about?
yes?
jim, you don't have to--
that's the rumor.
moon's too bright.
yes.  except when you creep around in your mother's --
gate three. it's boarding now.
coffee's perked.
hey, we qualify for the senior citizens early-bird special... did you see tommy today?  he misses you...
if you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
hello, david...
when it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  tell me if li mu bai is not more open the next time you see him.  i'll give him an earful!
don't treat me like i'm stupid.  it pisses me off.
whoopee.
damn... lost again. sorry.
you want me to dress like her?
they really applauded you today honey.
shit, stop with the money!  i never asked for a nickel.  i was just doing this.  and you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
-- what're you doing? -- jason, please, tell me what's happening!
well, then ask her, dumb ass.
way to go, anna.
ed... you're kinky!
i had to see you.
i'm sorry.
...the yellow ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
don't run off, jude.
who?
why?
have either of you seen david watts?
i've got something...
just a minute, maxie.  somebody...
i hate loving her.  i hate the kind of her person she is.  i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  i hate letting her use me. but i love her too much to do otherwise.  and i certainly love her too much to kill her.  i couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  but you?  you got the killing in you, boy.
he didn't mention the money.  what he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! that's what i want you to do something about!
thanks. i'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
that's good. so then what do you do now?
nothing. will you excuse us for a while?
my lady friend has a personality disorder.
hell, yeah. she's not my unicorn.
you think freeze will take the bait?
oh, not that.  you promised you'd burn it.
work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  but i still got it, eddie...  'boop boop be-doop'.
and while you're at it, i'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
i didn't call you anything before that.
he couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. yet another mistake for "mr. fantastic."
no.
i'm just tired.
...you're just poking at it...
just every once in a blue moon, you know.
it's all arranged. i'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany mr. merrick. you'll be using the royal entrance and princess alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
we're not dropping it. now that's the reason, isn't it? i'm a dirty degenerate, aren't i? i'm not fit to --
you going to work all day?
i won't pay for nothing.
marty! it's me. paul.
just don't tell lydia.
we can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
a few empty tables.  it's cozier. besides, mel torme couldn't fill this place on a wednesday night.
of the tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
wait a minute - let me out.
sean, this is important. and it's above personal rivalry--
well...
damn...
i've never seen sea so blue. tahiti is magnificent, scottie.
i know.  we asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  look, how about we get in touch your agent.  you still with jerry?
i didn't know it was a secret. there aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- i told you to stay next to me!
i miss her.  what do you think happens to someone after they die?
would that make me a heel?
hey, you haven't quit on you, i'm sure as hell not gonna.  i just mean, i'm juggling a lot right n...
he's about to.
what's the matter? isn't it cheap enough? a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
that's what the guy said.
skip, i've got a problem and i need some advice.
it's simple. you pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
good.
what's wrong now?
yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
they'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  let her go.
mary is lila's sister?
were we together?
how long's it been shut?
you sure this is such a bright idea?
you don't have to do that.
i can see what you mean.
i'm going to start one of those custody suits. i don't give a fucking shit. you know?
she was there.  she didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
that so?  i've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the black pearl?
let us settle this tomorrow.
no, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. so, what about?
you know what happened.
"occupational hazard".
have you considered my offer?
so where you go off to, hutton? some expedition in new guinea or outer mongolia?
where does it lead?
we were until your torpedoes!
stay away from me!
home school. til today.
have you visited the little boy on my floor?  jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
who are you?
when'd you get here?
we're old friends, chickie - quit it!  a big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  what did you think would happen in his house?
to begin with, where mary is. do you?
victor, i'm sorry i --
listen, i'll never make it.  i'll have to go to the toilet.
oh, everything is so wonderful! it's getting farther and farther away!
ok. well. i'm gonna go out of town. i'm going to go out of town just for two days...
i intend to.  this phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
i thought the fbi test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
hi.  turn on your tv... <u>good morning america</u>, the <u>morning news</u> and <u>today</u> are all about to talk to arnold schwarzenegger and i think he's live on at least two of them.
i feel like you're turning me into a vcr.
oh. sorry.
who knows why they all left...
what's the running time?
i'll tell you what's gotten into me. i don't know you from adam, right? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it. okay. i said i'd check it out and i did. now i don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and i don't like it.
your majesty!
it's horrible. terrence was one of the most brilliant men i've known.
mrs. semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
i just got here.
why!? because, i'm having thoughts i hardly know what to do with. i... can't seem to... stop them.
no, i want you in.  but being in means you gotta do something.  not just say you're in.
i don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, numa, it's none of our business.  let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
naked girls, wild sex, video games. no wonder it's called "heaven."
thank you. what time is it?
be careful, peter.
i like grandma's cooking....
really?  too bad.
father, i've lost respect for you. i thought you were a man of principle.
we don't know that, do we?
oh clayton.
yes.
nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
fuck you, grease-ball!
you don't want any water?
we're gonna be plumbers, frank.  we're gonna plug a leak.
i'm lucky they don't knock down the building. it could happen anytime. and everything worth remembering is right here.
how do you feel?
i came up here to sneak a smoke.
what three hundred grand?
first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant burgel.  if indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
so the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
you know who i am?  toby n. tyler. my friends call me tnt. you know why?
it is johnny.  he came all the way from california to be at the wedding.
god almighty. i thought i was the only one.
that's impossible, man!  okay, clark, out of the john where i can see you!
take a left and your next right.
you hear me?
dad, i was talking to jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew annie in another life.
well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
there ought to be a law against dentists reading. matter of fact, i thought there was. anyway, this is an obsession. he can't be persuaded out of it.
what's your problem, whistler?
what's the matter? are you sick?
you don't say. that's a tough racket. my hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. damned interesting work, i'd imagine.
stop it.
that was foolish of me. why didn't you shove me away?
hey, guys.  check it out-- i saw this dud on the tube last night. he is incredibly cool.
i'll help you...!
mr. kirkeby, i don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
i can see why they sent you along.
inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the boston strangler?  this is the fourth, is that correct?
--a spy, you mean?
hurry!
not be safe?  what on earth are you talking about?
why?  if they could never take title.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. he never had a kid before, and crashed the car. now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "get her in here.". he forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. so, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. well, his name was waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if i'da been a boy, they would't call me waldo. so they asked waldo where he was from. and, so there you go.
do you want to stay here?
that tape sucked, by the way!
this is l939. can't you subtract?
buzz fazeli.
okay, i'll kill you when you change, i swear to god in jesus christ's name.
we need to talk.
they have no right to treat you like that.  you've given them every- thing.  for four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
*liver* killed him?
can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if i'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
what about jack daniels?  wasn't he a decorated general in the civil war?
why not call for help?
how'd you get started?
hey there, dan'l! black dan'l!
okay, come on in. looks like you had a bad face lift.
no, she'll only reject me in the end and i'll be frustrated.
now, look here, norm ...
we're using esper -- a 231 -- that picked up holden's alarm.  its guess is that all five are in the city.
what is it, alfredo? right now, of all times!
oh come off it, mare. what about what's-his-name... steverino? you could've at least passed the baton on that one.
and you, what do you like?
of course you will, sweetheart. this one, search this one. ed finds the keys without any trouble.
what's wrong?
they look like a couple of kids chief.
neighbor!  doctor!  i live across the hall.
that's what i thought.
will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
huh.
the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  the other problem is there was a tree right there...  blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film.
that.
you use your equipment, don't you?
mr. stamper will escort you to the plane.
yeah.  why don't we?
curious, maybe.
 i don't know.  um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. maybe...another hour?

it is a beautiful day.  i am merely enjoying it.

there's something out there!
you wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after i get out of here?
i'm here.
well, can you tell me why?
yes, i am.  but i prefer the machete.  certain moves, however, call for a sword.

there's a storm comin', titus. no boats are going out.
i did my box work, but i wanted to show you before i showed landy. i came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. i mean, i'm with you on this, conklin was a nut, but a traitor? i just can't get there.
those are all 78s... can you play 78s?
don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? i mean what you're fighting for?
thank you, sir.
that money is your per diem.
truth?
there, you see, captain. a rock!
i'm sorry, dante. i thought you understood.
glad to meet you, too.  you are all your father talks about.
well... i'm tired all the time, obviously. i always feel like taking a nap. but when i try to sleep, i have trouble.  my muscles ache. and my joints. i feel like an old person, or like i did back when i used to work out too hard... what else?...
mary! come back ...
granville's looking for you anyway.
work, lunch, groceries, laundry... fabulous...
ralph, come here a minute, will you?
what's my status?! i've lost three men and your worthless fuck! after i kill this asshole i'm coming your yllo!
what?
i wanna date a musician...
pure politics!
where the hell is he?  an hour and a half late.  an hour and a half!
about what?
why jeopardize what we've already done? we caught the sonofabitch.  carl stargher.  that's going to be like bundy, gacy, dahmer.  a case that makes careers.  but if we push our luck.  if this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
what kind of creature is this? last night you two were spooning -
so you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? a water gun.
the way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  what strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
oh, you don't have to worry about that. i have quite a bit of influence in personnel. you know mr. sheldrake?
you just come in on amtrack?
they must've learned how to control water... i mean at a molecular level.  they can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  put it under intelligent control.
never.
i watched tv.
are the disks still in your room?
can't sleep?
zukovsky...
what?
yeah. no. it's ok. what's goin' on?
i'm sorry, but... the stones...
all of your children are delinquent, mrs. little, and one, at least, malcolm is a thief.
room service...hi, sarah.
i can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
i just think ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
that it wasn't an accident.
i dunno, boy.
i think we're making a lot of noise.
well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
how're ya fixed for ammunition?
sir?
billy, what's the matter?
what's going on, jerry?
i'm telling you, i can't.
what happened?  you got fired, huh?
i'm sorry i was mad at you, theo.
yes they are.
what?
what do you mean you're not a christian?  of course you're a christian, we're all christians...
<u>we</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  maybe cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
ironic, isn't it?
-- a job.
don't know. just shot up one day from a stump.
don't pull it, norman.  it'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  norman?
he's right.  it's unprofessional.
one of them <u>is</u> a cop.
that would indicate that it's the future.
klingon blood.
closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
barbara jean.
did you say..."peggy"?
silence!  i order you!
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
i missed you.
oh.  um, would it be terrible if i wanted to go home early?
maybe you don't know what it's like where mrs. crawford comes from -- but i do.  i came from a neighborhood just like hers.  this is a whole other world for her.  she's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  so, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  being poor and having pride is not a crime, mr. dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
no, wait.  i can be dumb.  really. or mean, or whatever.  i can learn. i'm useful.
you were gone for a while.
detective donald kimball?
...are followin' him around.
you play the cello!  it's my favorite instrument.
hey!  what is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
so, ramona!
hey.
really?
uh, no.  but i, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
the chauffeur. he's watching.
steve, dear, please forget all of this.  what can it matter after tomorrow?
...how's the turtle food this week?
where's your watch?
just as you are, sir...
so, now what?
well this is your business, benjamin.  if you --
they'll do it.
pops, you're a genius!
oh come on.
am or pm?
i think i was trying to sleep with you at the time.
cincinnati country day.
do i have to play with the little kids?
oh, yeah.  they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  no expense account.  no place to live.
i need a ruling on the hats.  i say a leopard-skin, and...
well --
not for the kind of place i want to do.  i won't be in chicago that long.
on the job?
ben's still out there --
i said i wonder if you could help me.
mad dog coll's in town on a job.
what, senorita?
how's loomis?
mom.  mom.  there are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
...i don't know what i do feel like.
i'm a writer. ted okum said you're producing this wallace beery picture i'm working on.
that's good: he earned it.
to keep out the cold.
director?
tim, can we go? this is ridiculous.
i don't know.
i do not love him.
i should butcher all and every one of them. merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
mommy...?
i didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
lou escobar – he's a lieutenant.
uh, uh, this is great.  i mean, i love e.e. cummings, but i can't let you get this.
jesus, ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
what would you have me do?
probation?
right.
c'mere. i want to talk to you.
here. let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
and spring fling.
we're rich in what really matters.
this gal's married to i think a philosophy professor at uc santa barbara.
i was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. and then throw him in the can.
rob.
okay, i'm on it.  hey.
oh, no! that was for the cafeteria! this is different!
we're just having a little drink.
what if i couldn't get to you?
yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "speed." she's cute.
some things changed between us. now, he thinks who the fuck he is. he's been passing certain remarks that i don't like.
no, i got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
what, what, what is it?!
you can't change your mind.
yeah.
three-one-zero, aye!
how'd you get that? playing with your pitchfork?
i’ve got work tonight, jane.
i'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
did you miss me?
no way. no fuckin' way.
come on, honey, let's get out of here.
of course, mr. lebowski on the right, mrs.  reagan on the left, taken when--
it's not about working hard --
gerald.
i want you to fix these fish!
illusionists get. las vegas contracts, d'amour.  magicians get burned.
mom, dad. meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. he's what you'd call clinically bummed.
is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
i did it because because i'd never stopped thinking about you and if i didn't find you i knew my life would never be good again.
i'm a work in progress.
they're trying to come through the door!
i...liz...all i ever wanted, was for you to be happy. i just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...i just love you so much...so much...
naw. i'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
i'm not sure --
in vino veritas.
wait a minute, fellahs.  i was just thinkin'.  i really don't want to see the wizard this much.  i better wait for you outside.
and it's deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. i guess i'm not the girl i thought i was.
that's nice. what'd you tell him?
bobby--
good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when i bring him out.
take your paws off me!
will your power outward.
yes, uncle. how are you?
dodge to murphy.
yes.
who?
isn't he dead?
well, i don't know.  it could have been anybody.  there are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around millard.  you know, like rick thieson and kevin speck and those burn-outs.  or doug schenken - what about him?  or what about tammy metzier?  her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
yeah. it's close by. that's what's creepy. they've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except i don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
hiya maxwell.
say something ...
let's have a minimum of pretending. i'll want to do a column about you-
do you want to go somewhere and talk?
thanks for your help, peck.
but i understand what you mean.
barbara <u>zelman</u>?  i don't believe this!
"dear annie: thanks for your letter.  it was great.  we're very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine's day and seeing if we are m.f.e.o. sleepless in seattle."
uh-huh.
excuse me.
max?
do i know you?
daddy!!!
they knew who you were when they broke in your house?
just a minute, you!
i am a princess.  you have no right to order me about.
go ahead.  skin it.  skin that smoke wagon and see what happens.
yes, sir.
come on, schulz! spill it! how did you get the information? about manfredi and johnson? about the stove and the tunnel? who's giving it to you? which one of us is it?
