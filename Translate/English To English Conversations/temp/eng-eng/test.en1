that said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  we'll begin with president.
what makes you think that!  if you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, bumstead...
you're the only one missing a grenade.
just relax.
now what can i do for you?
okay.
mothafucker! you just set bobby seale up to be kidnapped. they dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in chicago. how much the pigs pay you for this one, judge? 
"what are you thinking?"...that was it. the hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. i know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, i can't lose and i can't get hurt.
is it contagious? 'cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
well, hurry up.  the needle's going wild.
utah? i thought you'd be going to new york or paris. what's in utah?
and blind people, crippled...
very slick.
who's your daddy!
sure, dad.
i don't understand.
your predecessor. he did- n't like to get outta bed. catch you later, freddy t ..
alvy singer over here!
not me.
you need money to take a girl out
nice girl, mary.
would you like a coke or something?
i'm not my mother.  i can't have the respect without the knowing.
there is no new ending. page 750 on is exactly the same.
is that what that is?  i never seen any before.  i always thought that stuff was expensive!
maybe i'm making a mistake. maybe i just need to learn to live with this. first of all, i'll get over it. secondly, it happened. those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. who said that? churchill? i'm not sure. but i don't care. she did it to me. i have to rid myself of this. fuck her.
absolutely. long as she can keep it. isn't that right, james...
we already have a super-tanker.
i've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. wait until it happens to you sometime.
well -- where ya goin'?
you don't know?
lydia?
that didn't sound like thunder.
well, i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cook's chicken used to be called coon's chicken, and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
so what's your job this summer?
i couldn't work in the city. you see, i've got my family in the country.
i see.  mr. franklin, i must ask you and miss hayes to keep this incident with mr. gardiner to yourselves. there's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. so please, not a word.
sure.  never come back.  disappear forever.
some village in the mountains -- alethera, i think.
the door's locked. i'll gotta go around... wait here.
oh, yes.
yes, sir. good night.
what, you think i don't know how to get myself off?  hell, that's what half of band camp is!  sex ed!
what?
you'll be alone.
god, it's ugly!
how so?
why didn't your brother tell you that nathan was having an affair?
some other time, stevens.
you don't have to twist my arm.  say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
he was killed doing something he saw in the movie. it was terrance and phillip... they killed kenny.
wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
you're right, you're right, superman. there were wrinkles to iron out. but, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the xk 101.
that's not good in prison. it's just not good.
well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...
...once or twice. his name is charlie meadows.
i hate them.
why worry? it was insured--how about that swimming lesson i promised you?
these disks . . . where are they?
got me.
you're being narrow-minded.
what's your offer, jesse?
i guess they do.
why 're you doing this?
hey there's your dad and shelly.
i should have told you sooner --
well, you're right there. ten minutes ago i had a job.
lay off once, would you?
what?
oh, i'm fine, doc.
about three.
oh my god! my -- my tap costume's gone.
jack wade. citibank. commercial loan division. if you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
thank you.
what?
roy, you're a short-con operator. and a good one, i think. don't talk to me like i'm another square.
yeah. call him.
you need a partner. there's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, mr. fitzsimmons. i've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
yes i could, i could see her as a psychiatrist...
it's very personal. it couldn't be more personal. is this a business or an obsession with you?
who do you think i am?
you were in red. that red sweater with the little flowers, i think. you were leaning against his car.  he looked a little like a kid. kind of goofy and wide-eyed. i'd never seen him look like that before. happy. you looked beautiful. you looked in love.
i can deliver ganz.  but you gotta get me outta here first.
sorry.
i don't know.  but it's something alien.
he's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? don't play -- i know what ya feelin', but don't play.
yeah, it would be kinda great.
with all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
yeah, you know. probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or...
no.
all right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
it belongs to bob's uncle.
satisfied with your cabin?
you gonna get rough now, threaten me? i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
a new pair of panty hose. is it enough?
you must hate your brothers.
no!  this isn't true.  we... we were around other people, together, both of us...
to discredit me. because i know who they are. look, i thought i explained it to you. those people can say or do anything. and they will. it's all narrative to them, it's... are you going to print what this guy said?
watch your tone, mister.
you better come sit down. you are still sick.
i'm glad. hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-i-am question you've been asking yourself. now, we're gonna have a little q and a, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  want a chesterfield?
i thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
come clean, betty.  at night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
fire, mr. scott!
you're very rude... if you don't come back --
what have you come as?
i think she looks nice! her lips are very thin so i used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, i'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
i thank you.
the home of eternal damnation, house of hades, h.e. double toothpicks...
no.
well, uncle pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if i ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. meanin' the best. on account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
absolutely not. no more than seven percent.
the girl's name was doreen. that's all i know.
alicia!  come here, have a seat.  show miss vale why you wear the mask.
i guess i am.
ok. ok. let's not fence around ... this is the situation. some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, b58/732 and t47/215.
i...i <u>think</u> that's right...
sit down!
hell of a day, ray. yankees are on fire.
be sure they got enough water.
thank you... have you any news?
tell me about it. i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago, and one night we opened for the melvins... do you know who the melvins are?
eight o'clock.
don't, beth.  please.
what about his teeth?
i love you, max. i really mean it. i love you. come to the pantry.
i don't know. for this thing to blow over, it could take days.
must be tough for you.  what happened.
yes... jeffrey.
jesus, jon, i nearly choked to -- where are we --
whenever you ask me something why do you always say "let me ask you something?" why don't you just ask me?
on her knees, i have no doubt! very touching, very academy-of-dramatic arts!
i didn't say that i would run... i just...
am i missing something?
dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  we need to get a look at sid 6.7's final profile.
well neither have i, but it's us or him.  if he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  his kind is hardly even human anyway.
well, thank you, mr. bateman.
no problem.
sorry. no one has seen signor ripley since san --
point the gun at me!
i said you win.
where are you going? you'll freeze out there. you don't even have a coat.
get it over with...
well...where would you like me to start? antarctica is a long way from dallas, agent scully. i can't very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links you've made here. bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
who's next? you? me? bob?
you were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? your trip to aspen? they’re all panicked here...
i want my father back, you son- ofa-bitch!
i don't understa--
boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
strudel, this is herr mozart. say good morning.
your records are older than you are.  have you never heard of new wave?
why would i be angry?  it was beautiful.
give me a date, doctor.
but </u>alive</u>!
something for burns.
you're as bad as my father.
sir. webb has no idea. and he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
yeah... i seen him around.  high- roller dude named strader.  joshua strader.  runs a club on the west side.  encounters.
it's the same questions, mrs. little. since the death of your husband --
-- and an america's cup trials...
tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. my guess is that the unsub is having us on. he checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. tell me if i'm wrong.
i want to sleep. give me five minutes on that couch.
you'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
i just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
yeah, very big, a giant.
what do you mean? men have died trying to obtain this information. i will give it to you for free.
they're your fans, your audience-
would you shhh! mary's gonna hear us.
what did i 'get?'
mr. smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
i know.  it's so 'eighties.'  it's the cute decade.
we were gonna be millionaires you said. nobody'd suspect a thing. i had never even met her. no connection. then you went and had that fucking car accident.
rowan's already called the hotel, michael.  at the cemetery by now, i would guess.
i'm sorry.
i certainly didn't mean you.  of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
their atmosphere will sustain him. he will look like one of them.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
for chrissakes i hate that shit, cut it out.
ah, i see. that makes it all alright then.
i never saw him before!
are you one of the players?
<u>never trust the living</u>!  we <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
wait. when are you going to tell them?
-- his mother never lived here. she was from up in north dakota.
booked them all at baskin- robbins.
lucky it didn't step on his head.
how come you took so much interest in her, dr. darling?
doesn't matter what it's called, harry's got martin weir and it's gonna be big.
i think i'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
yes sir.
wait.  i want to tell you something.
when you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
we also provide 24-hour after-sale service. were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
and i fig- and i figured something out.
it's really happening.
why did you look at me that way?
sure. i remember . . . say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? mine did.
gay?
that's right. i'm on my way over to this officer school in port ranier.
i want to know. we haven't talked this way in years.
when i said quincy could do better, i was thinking about you.
maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
two hundred and seventy.
from what?
we do not want your tired and sick.
sushi.
what's that?
all right.  let's get on it.  what'll you need?
just missed deleon.  hayes is up in the squad.
no... two.
i don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
um, coffee.  if that's okay?
soo -- pah doo -- per.
you've got one shot -- and we can't die.
i understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
i <u>like</u> our history. and i like you. i'd probably like <u>brill</u> if i ever got to--
what about me?
i don't know.
how many onions does it say to use?
are we in a big hurry?
i didn't feel well...
it's because of the children she's got to go. i don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
you never said anything.  about the drapes.
well, what the hell am i supposed to do?
great to be drunk. sobriety's killing me.
follow you where?
closin' down, sir.
what you need is a collar.
flo, i'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
i do know, gary. i feel the same way. i thought i was coming here for a job. but it's meant a lot more.
you've said that for weeks.
i don't particularly care for that kind of talk, bobby.
please hold, sergeant...
here's to my last week of freedom.
you seem to appreciate the local scenery.
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i'm living on an isolated ridgetop with delores?
he's the best dog in the world.  they're both coming tonight.  not my idea.
i'm struck by your phraseology.  i did not <u>last</u> with him.  i was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
it's supposed to be don knotts.
well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
can he trust you?
ok, cop. i want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. tell them i've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. i'll double the church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 g cash. get it?
i'm telling you your life!
nicole labetzki.  victim seven. forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a k-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
thirty years. maybe more.
diet soda?
but then i would've missed the pleasure of your company.
right.
sort of a jack london style?
not mad.
who wants me to stop?
she's lying down.  she's exhausted.
okay, so the guy's gonna look like meatloaf's backside.  no-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
i'm leaving, man.  i'm bailing town. this place has gotten way too hairy.
go down there and kill everybody, i guess.
let him wait.
does a horse miss a saddle?
i don't got no daddy, you dig? i got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
none of this stuff was here in 1962. the valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
the touch?
but not you.
why?
they believe in the 'tulip.'
i see your point, bedsoe, but i have to look at this from the law's point of view.  there's something missing here.  it's something i'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  it's called evidence.  get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  find me an eye witness.  dig up a motive.  until then we don't have a case against him.
for godsakes, jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person.
can't say, major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
yes, mr. dobisch.
all the little kids arrive today. we're not ready to deal with that alone.
there's nothing. i'm coming down.
but it look like a man. it... i saw it.
no!  no.  it's not the same ... i ... no.  what you did ... it was ... evil.
no, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, i fell off the school.
don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
of course.
the sub-basement?
you should have stayed in bed this morning.
hello, is this elaine?
this guy, on the johnny carson show.
i've tried that! population census have got him down as dormanted, the central collective storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the information retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... security has him down as excised., admin have him down as completed
[was it] &quot;meirschultz&quot;?
french fries and ketchup.
what kind of exercise?
what did you do to your hair?
oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
what? why?
did you tell him you were leaving?
what's that got to do with the radiator hose?
anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. i've wanted to leave many times, but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. anyway, i'm rambling. if you're going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. doyle is a monster. not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. a dangerous person. i've told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. maybe even kill one of them. i see it in his eyes. i'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. doyle will make your life hell. you're a perfect target. when i first saw you i was afraid of you. not really afraid, i guess, just taken aback. but also, i felt a real sensitive feeling from you. and for some reason, frank has adopted you. much like a stray animal. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it like that. in a good way. anyway, i just want you to know what you're in for. i have a good feeling about you. you're good for frank. maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it in a bad way.  there's one more thing. it's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. but what i see before me is a gentle, simple man. all i want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around linda and frank. you know. you would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
rats! they fought the dogs and killed the cats, and bit the babies in the cradles, and ate the cheeses out of vats. and licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, split open the kegs of salted sprats, made nests inside men's sunday hats, and even spoiled the women's chats, by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats...
oh, no, no!  i won't let you take him!  you go away, you....!  oooh, i'll bite you myself!
but i got a train to make.
i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
yes. i just got that, actually. it was a gift.
i was afraid of that.
aye.
okay.  okay.
a symbol, master.
you used to go out with her?
look here. if i ever did eat some pussy - i would never eat any pussy - but, if i did eat some pussy, i sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. i'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
no you don't.
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. you'd probably get a promotion out of it.
lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . destroying superman!
my man, i speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. i've been giving this one a lot of thought, and i believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
like me.
gus gorman, this is my psychic nutritionist.
captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
i'm here for an interrogation. you've been called a graffiti artist and i wanna know why. all i see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
remove him at once.
i can hit those boys from here. we just need a distraction.
maude???!
did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  just be glad i did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  set up for life.
and you're not?  maybe you're my puppet.  but like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  it's the puppet's dream.  wondering if they're human!
folks'll ask question.
couldn't want a better death. lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
you are woman.  i know woman well.
you're not falling asleep, are you? you could drown, you know.
you ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
bye.
dead?
no, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
thanks. you are just a wonderful person.
i can't believe it! but what about doug?
yes -- i was looking for anna scott...
swear to god.
--personal rivalry? i'm not getting back at you.
you disappointed?
does he?
did you read the latest draft, by the way?
arghhh! oh!
stop worrying, colonel. i'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
he'll work it off.
i got it!  i got it!!!
you.  you're the same.  no matter where you go, there you are. always the same old you.  let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  i know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. we call it an "ego trip".
but, father, i don't really want any of that.
are you in danger now?
and i don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
i'm not just bringing anybody -- i'm bringing miss kubelik.
sure.
that's nonsense, alma.
come and get it.
no, edmund.  he's a man who can answer yes to those questions i ask you from time to time.
my nails.
thanks. it does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
luke needs help.  we must go back.
surprise.
but this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
did they send you...did they send you?
that lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
just go. please. i'll be o.k. i'm going to go see dad. he'll look after me --
you'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, i'm flying them in from sweden.
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. want to know what it's really like? it's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. glamorous, huh?  and the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
well, i was just calling to see how you're doing.
god, fred...
well.  it shows the prosecutor was wrong.  it was <u>carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  or he'd never have put up the lantern.
i don't give a shit who you ask.
i spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. i should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but i was with you.
he's not a witch.
straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- beverly hills -- where else you think he'd be?
i said i was sorry.
been to the boat show.
everybody's favourite computer, of course. he may have out calculated the rest of you, but i have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
yes, but i can't love a man named wally.
a six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
okay, i get your father, i get your mother and i get your brother, but what are you doing here?
who says that -- ?  -- never mind.  you have to listen to me, elaine.  simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  i inherited it from a madman -- i can show you --
a theatre poet?
you exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
another premonition?
pet it??!!
that's right.
yeah.
i don't have a week.  this case never should have come to trial. you know better.  you're mr. independent.  you want to be independent?  be independent now. i've got no sympathy for you.
like this.
i'm not sure i'd call them murder exactly. more like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
we have no choice but to continue as planned.  deploy the sentinels. immediately.
leon, i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say, which i thought nobody ever should say, because i thought it didn't exist... and, leon... i can't say it...
it's my apartment.
wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
you can keep them.
forget it.
come on, you can make it.
could it be a glitch? something the construction workers caused?
i know a little bit about human nature and what i've seen only confirms that.
it's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
i have never seen him.
i'm the one who watched the show... i was...
but to the victor belong the spoils.
yes?
do you think you are ready?
but that was the fourth straight time.
i caught your show down at the velvet room at the holiday inn, loved it when you busted into viva las vegas.
yeah.
oh well he sure did a beautiful job. pink and gold are my favorite colors.
explains the private detective. he traced her to the bates place.  what'd he exactly say when he called you?
thank you, officer ripley.  that will be...
didn't you hear him?
there is no problem.
valentine wasn't even there.  if he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  but i'll tell you something.  she stood in front of these dudes, man.  eyeballing <u>them</u>.  checking <u>them</u> out.  i felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
why?
now look more closely. look around the eyes and chin. see? see there?
wake up! stop playing with yourself. it's finished.
he'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
i'll get some towels. 
she's clouded your mind.  you're not thinking straight.
we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
sure.
all their lines were busy.
i suppose so. i suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. then we will be just like other people.  but these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
he's right beneath us.
they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous.
good, this way we can finally talk. i'll convince him this time.
leon hung himself...
where the hell are you taking us anyway? just blow something up already.
you're doing real good. can't you figure it out? i wanna finish this where it all began. woodsboro.
yeah, what - they put some schmuck on tv all day long or something?
that way.  you?
you're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
what?  but i saw 'em-
why don't you ask him.
didn't need one. we didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. man, the irs... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. nobody wants to argue with the irs.
congratulations, dwight, it's begun.
oh, but i just told you. --
i'm on her, amigo.  no worries. gotta jam.

i bet you do.
whatta we do now?
they're great.
may i see my mother?
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? when he put me in that trance...
its'...ah...about my daughter....
i understand.
no.
that's not what i'm asking for. i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards. and stop it from happening.
you are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
i have no memory.
so if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
we got it. we got it.
follow me.
what the hell is going on?  i mean what the <u>hell</u> is going on?!!
i'm just saying.
well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. and since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
nope, it's new stuff. no smell.
well, where are you going?
why, i believe the little woman cares.
yeah, thanks, it's ok.
fine, bob. how are you?
just so you know, i bought you out with maxie. i suggest you leave while you can.
look at the calendar, for christ's sake.  you said a sunday, not easter sunday.
we gonna stay, ain't we?
there's a bomb shelter over in durant, by the iga, on first. you all know where that is?
but that was so long ago.  it can't still bother you.
marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
what?
trust me, this ain't one of those times.
how shall i do it?
good reflexes.
how did he do that?  all those kids ... why do they hate me so much?
maybe it's supposed to end now. maybe god wouldn't have it any other way.
mine, too.
they've got quaid!  they're protecting him!
no... yeah...
i'll tell mike i'm sick. there's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. afterwards he can go out with the guys. just so the record is kept straight though, i love mike. what do want me to do?
you should go back and rest.
you were a beat and a quarter behind.
gonna knock down a wall?
i don't know.
ain't you boys ever rowed before? here, gimme those oars. i'll show ya how it's done.
we can do it!
i just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
i like women like that!
how could she miss this? this whole salute to collins was her idea.
if you go, i'll care for them as if they were my own.
he gets to be the hero.
you at least bring the gun?
give me a bit more credit. i think it's time we got back together, you know. i'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, i'm already in the job market...
billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
thanks.
they have a right to know. howard is a thief. he steals the truth.  i can't remember my baby! i can't remember my baby. it existed and i can't even remember. do you understand that?
was someone rude to you?
this is about your daddy's death?  hell, lee, you know my father died on the job. you could have told me...  this is about more than all that, isn't it?  this is about your daddy's last case, right?
i told you, i knew your sister.
how about ciudad juarez? you could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in albuquerque. it'll get you across the border.
please understand. if you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. i'll get you to your ship. i promise.
i'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way i can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
i'm simply quoting the law.
come on.
he's like the biggest idiot of all time!
foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, i'm told.  have you said anything about manchester, mr. preysing?
i'm reporting you to the irs.
i'd be clever as a gizzard --
jeffrey!!
now.  what is it you wanted to tell me?
...ditioning.
andy, do you know who reps kronos inc.?
there's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
i don't want to use it.
europe...  france. i’m french but i live in london...  ... england.
who are you to decide if you should live or die?
but what if they find out... god, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
where are you going?
i followed you here from court.

oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
listen to me very carefully, benjamin. you are not to see elaine again. ever. those are my orders. is that clear?
fuck "you're serious", raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
how do you do. i'm mrs. chasen. come in.
we'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
thanks.  i just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
waste of time.
yeah, i'm gonna start sleeping here.  masry & vititoe, can i -- damn it.  does anyone know anything about these phones?
does the world 'duhh' mean anything to you?
no.
absolutely nothing.
we all do. now let's go.
these are the only ones worth having.  and we're going to need them --
chicken salad, devra!
i've got be here for the police when they come.  then i've got to practise. in case you forgot i'm in the middle of a match right now.
i was afraid of that.
i want to be put on this case.
yes?
sure hudson.  are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo?
a hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the bronx.
now listen to me very carefully.
i can't find you.
tell him about baldy.
damn! how's it look?
uh... no.
probably going.
no. but i'm the only one with my sad story.  and that's how it's gonna stay.
you'll see.  gotta go.  sixteen minute round trip.
and now you must let me be the judge of that!
no ... they won't be able to tell.
i think it's our best bet. they're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. we can't say he was framed.
listen to me, mrs otto.  listen very carefully.  i do know what's best.
look at that - right on time.
that man there!
i have some parsnip stew from last week. if i just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
hm.
he's a liar! he has no such thing! it's my own fault. i should have had it patented first. he's a crook, damnit.
what about the old gentleman the other night, mr. faber?
i'm not interested.
that's good.
three days??!!
look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  if it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
get behind the shield! i'm about to release radiation!
walter, i sympathize, but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy --
like the light is scalding it.
oh, who did then? blair witch? snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
jim, pat, mick, what the fuck. long as you remember you're not at lords.
three months, bull. three months tonight. three months since the accident - and i'm no closer to going home than i was then.
dr. winkel.
yeah...
well if you don't get to marry mr. bixler.
really? what would it take?
switek pulling this off...?  that's not faith; that's delusional...
ellie...ellie...what...
you know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? do you believe it? that a place has a memory?
madam grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
the f.b.i. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  i think he's a first- timer.
do you know what i'm looking at robert?
i'm sorry, mr. gardner.  i was out of my office for a minute and when i got back -- he was gone.
i've seen this before.
lady patrizia!
if stage two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
what, what, i can't hear you...
him?
uh huh.
anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or howard.
nothing!
nay, jack, i'm but wary of your intentions.
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism.
his daughter, for god's sake-- i need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
to what do i owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
you're doing fine, aren't you?  i mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
well -- do you want to go up first?
you tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. look, vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. but don't try to fuck me. i don't think of you that way. i mean, i like you a lot -
that is so romantic.
beer?  well, all right.
john, it will not be easy.
do you think your father means that?
i think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
nice to meet you, betty.
not a damn thing.  what's going on?  mr. meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
just klaatu.
yes.
i've robbed just as many banks as you have! i know this town, and i know this bank, and i say it's an easy job.
never mind that. i'm concerned about you. your attitude.
you want to go in?  examine him?
i fixed you up with diane troxler and she put out, didn't she?
the dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
i suggest a deal. you write four copies of a letter. i'll send my four fastest ships. one in each direction. the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year. we'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. if westley wants you, bless you both. if not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. are we agreed?
what else?
i suppose not. gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
that's always been my problem.
why?
attic space.
you are pretty naive if you think it is.
hey santa, where are you? everybody’s here.
well... there's one indoors now. i've brought her back to see you.
fine.
once again we find ourselves in agreement.  what kind of work do you do, big dan?
i hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
who's the clown now?  huh?!  who's the fucking clown now?!
susan, i sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  i ask that you keep in mind that i am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what i want.
int. tunnel - day.
go to sleep ellen.
i ain't, goddamnit...it's jones!..
i hear he drives a carriage around central park or something.
you know i'm whacko, sam, what'd you find?
damn right.  instinct, man.  if you think too much, it doesn't work.  just listen...
yeah, where's your urge to purge?
i've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
but, in particular?
oh, sure.
bullshit! bullshit!
unidentified flying objects.
more fancy talk... you want to know what haddonfield is? families. children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. you're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
crop duster.
about anything.
i'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. bad things! those are bad fucking things!
not my place, sir.  it would only be a matter of time before i'm calling you dave.  then where would we be?  by next year, you're my sweety-pie" and i'm "coochie-coo".  i'11 be back in 15.
the average man would go after the reward. all you seem to—
you know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. that's the thing, romeo.
ray --
they're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. they're -
it doesn't matter who we are. follow the tunnel to the end.
what i do know is that whatever he's becoming, sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
c'mon. what're ya tryin' to be? the phantom lady?
hi.
you look mighty familiar to me.  you sure you're not from around here?
that's right, captain. just passin' the time.
dr. jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
why else would he be taking you to the ivy? you've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
don't you get it, gus?  if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at berkeley.  it gives her the motive to kill nilsen.
no - it's showgirls.  i've been married seven or eight times.
for calling you a homo.
what does arresting us get them?
i'm listening.
maybe you could just put in a shot of martell?
you're terrible.
...just a minute...
how much?
horny bastard.
no.
what, you've never seen one before?
fuck the mall.  you know that motel on the road west of town?
thank you.
do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
c'mon, billy.  i'm trying to work for god's sake...
you got it all in your head?
that's three things.
fame. my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
i just wanted to share an apartment. what was so complicated about that?
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
no! no! no!
what would you like? texas?
you bet your ass.
i was just tryin' to...to...
i have no reason to.
sideways -  for every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
anything.
hurry up.
no. no you're not.
your fuckin' head, huh? don't fuck around, tony.
come on up, jimmy.  say, that's some puppy.  what's his name?
tell them that's impossible. i need my normal lead time.
you're a good man, mr. kringelein -- a very good man.
peter warne, you've gone far enough. i won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
i've gotten to like it. i've gotten to like everything about the way you live. it's one big love affair. if you knew my life back home in new york...
you mean like benefits?
you said that?  and what did he say? did he say you could leave her?  did he say we'd be happy?
yeah, but this is hard work.  can't talk now.
yes, edna, and i must say you've been great about the ...
he's not my boyfriend.  i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i ain't spoken for.  not yet that is.
it can't be.
you are right. what can i...
her name is felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  she ran away from pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in brooklyn with a guy named chico. strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  i can't bear to think about that baby. our grandchild, auggie. just think of it. our grandchild.
well, i'm going to tell you anyway. i did cheat on that exam at groton. but so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  and i'm expecting you won't mention it again.  i don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but i'm willing to pretend i did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  but can i tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  what are you, his shadow?  do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  you know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with w.p.  that means without you.  okay, pal?  let's eat.
who's lisa?
maybe you'd better ask him.
i don't believe you. i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
right there -
oh i don't think so.
yes ...  fits better in a football helmet.
get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'beach closed' signs, and let polly do the printing.
yep.
i'll see you later.
i don't give a shit about your cousin's car. we're here about my car. so, shut your mouth! you think you can do that? you think you can keep your big mouth shut?
no, i'm not!
son, let's watch the tape.
sure! mckinney will never suspect you--
angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. we are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
will you come here?
nothing.
who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair...
sergeant... i'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
i'm not tired.
thank you, dad.
why not?
they thought it said, "liberatis me," "save me," but it's not "me." it's "tutemet:" "save yourself."
gotta situation here.  where are you?  stuck in traffic?
of what?
you got a problem with drilling, probie?
yeah.  it's kind of nice.
are you sure you didn't call?
very well.
i want us to go out.
it's no problem.  i called mom and dad in germany; it's like they were there.
she wasn't in the...
move aside. this is the king's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
aw, come on, baby...you're the girl of my dreams.
suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
bandit?
yo, yo, yo...
oh, as bad as that, huh?
if you can't do what i ask, ray, use that money to go back home, then.
you don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
i don't know. [beat] i thought i was crazy after you left that day. i died. i still think i could be crazy. but then i replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it i could remember -- and it was like...i don't care if i was, or am. i haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [beat] and when you left, all i wanted was...
oh, yes, jeffrey. come in. he'll be back any minute now. you're welcome to wait. is it urgent?
you left me a message?
why not?
[beat] what do you need me to do?
amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and i have no more concerns.
now just a moment, just a moment --
it's all right, finn.
calling an individual, charles, in new york. confirming a social outing for friday night.
really?
i need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
i... we are humble people...
it'll be wonderful! i'll show you my old stomping grounds!
i'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, miss walker, you have nothing to worry about.
i wouldn't know.  what kind of wife are you looking for?
absolutely, you have every right.  i need you to do me a favor.
don't spend too much time searching. you ever vetted somebody's old code before?  it's a different skill. stay close to the surface. the best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. you know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  in a tree.
no, baby. now look, that girl that called -- i have to talk to her, she'll do something.
do you think i have not considered that?  i have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
oh, yeh.
hi, helen. man, you look great.
they won't believe us.
it is crazy!
how did they find out?
not just yet. would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why i ended up here in the basement?
you're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  you're never going to amount to anything.
no, it's true.  last night when you were sleeping, i had you all to myself.
black's fine.
you do?
i don't know, dignan. i just --
real mccoy.
i can do heather's handwriting as well as my own.
a year ago, the whole of europe was marching alongside of us.  today, the whole of europe is marching against us.
then you must find out what your beliefs are.
you got a suspect...
you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
oh yes, dear. i took the pills an hour ago. i should be gone by midnight.
yeah, mick.  i've got the money. i'm staring right at it.
is it awfully violent?
then blame the one who made her...
no.  all you need is to want to be the best.
right.
yes, but i...
don't, i'll drink it.
so what's the problem?
maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. he stole your passwords.
what do you mean?
what about her?
he'd like to start serving immediately.
sorry, i didn't think we were making that much noise.
oh, adam.  i don't have gloves.  my nails keep getting longer.  i'll break them.
goodbye and thanks.
did the alarm go off?  the house... they... you didn't see... ?
there's something else.
but not flush against the tunnel?
it hit sideways and skidded in.
bob, i gotta bad feeling about this, i... i'm telling you i got a bad feeling, man, i don't think i'm gonna make it... y'know what i mean?
he must still be in there.
sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  jesus christ, grab her!
this is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
all right, hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
if you don't even know what you want to do...
you're a whore?
because then i'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
we don't ride with vampires.
come on speedy!
so -- maybe i'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
luke's got a point... ... fear is their greatest defense... i doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
ok. boy. jesus!
no.
well, it was nice meeting you. enjoy the rest of the trip.
i killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... i left nothing for you!
but you won't sign, correct?
make it alexander's, i like the toy department.
since colosimo bit it, i gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
that's okay. live a little, learn a little.
so you think it's all nonsense, huh?
no, dummy.  two.
save it, honey.  we want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up mr. zukerman's phone bill.
isn't he precious?
why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
why?
you ok out there?
really?
i don't think so.
exactly that.
... if she can find me? -- that's a brilliant idea!  if she's really been sent by god she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  bring her up!
i know but mom doesn't.  maybe if it came from simone, if simone spoke to mom -- she could straighten things out.  dinner, maybe.
flea!  o'neil!  why is there a break in that line?
yes, sir.
calm down. you'll be straight in a few hours.
i think you should go back to your seat now, joey. right, clarence?
i was so nervous. i remember i couldn't think of anything to say. there were long silences.
in the morning.
you need five years training to handle a joint like...
all of which he's now missin'.
torpedoes coming in -- !
please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
do you really need this bed, lady?
you don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
sixty days?
you got a c-plus?  i can't believe i cheated off you.
i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory.  thanks to marcus aurelius.
10,000 gold crowns.
twenty-five percent.
photographs - compromising stuff. and he'll use 'em.  the agency plays for keeps...  i knew oswald.  he was in my civil air patrol unit.  i taught him everything.  a "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  i treated him good.  he'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... he got a raw deal.  the agency fucked him.  just like they're gonna fuck me.
yeah.  turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
only common sense.
you were with him?
good to meet you.  again.
what am i gonna do -- i'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
closer?!
he's not plugged-into the system. he's in the fucking system!
why?

dr. evil?
no way...  ...i wanna rock!
anybody! er, er—beany'll do!
you are a liar!
you see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. i ask you -- is that fair?
you will run into the hotel and hide behind the u.n.
dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
that's a-no good.  if i apologize we no got a war.  look -- i send you a scrap of paper.  you send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
haiphong.
what'll i tell him?
murray had some ideas about the fire and ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  i think they're kind of interesting.
may i ask if you are jewish, mr lombard?
where are you going?
you got a problem with me, grady?
excuse me. what did you say?
listen, it may be a little out of date. you know, i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
hobby! what can she do? she cooks and she cleans. you gotta have a house to clean. you gotta have children to cook for. these are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
you're a cop. figure it out.
because i want to.
believe me, that won't be a problem.
i know.  well, that's all i really wanted to say.  so, okay, then.
jesus, fergus, you're a walking cliche. you know we won't leave her out of this. but i'm glad to see you care.
impossible.  how dare you bring a panicky lie.
yeah, most people have that. it's confusing here.
a nap won't help. i've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. i can't even remember. if i go to sleep now, i'm dead for twenty hours.
i should be trying to stop you.
fine.
you're sleeping with her, aren't you?
better than not getting a job?
no one, sir.  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
you and me, roy. what a team we'll make. we think alike; we get along together. once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. you won't regret this, roy.
it was.
i ain't dense. and he's been here twenty minutes.
was. albrecht  this isn't top dollar's style anyway.  this was somebody else. somebody new.
one-twenty.
it's nothing. c'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
don't joke. after major strasser's warning tonight, i am frightened.
i don't want his money.
dogs ... season starts tomorrow.  it keeps me calm.  i don't like going back into the same building four times.
roger, wolf one. can you make it to the ocean?
it was a miracle!
josephine actually went to the congo last year.
yes, no.
i'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
that man keeps calling about his training film.  i can't convince him we don't have a s.w.a.t. team.
charley... . charley... . wow... .
i'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. but this is different.  she wasn't your mother mother--
if you'll just let me -
it just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
i don't care about being hip anymore.
you stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
i wanna powder my nose...
actually, no.  i was just telling nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
what happened?
very encouraging. most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
dad, you there?
delivery!
yes.
i'm not dealing.
okay.  goodnight.
i know.  it happened by itself.
no. am i supposed to?
you got to be kidding me.
you lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? and you didn't get to know him any better than that?
okay.  okay.
get them out of here. if he says one word, shoot him.
believe it or not, you're safe here. the judicial police will kill you. if they can.  this page?
no...  i don't have room in my kitchen...
you didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
i'll pay you.
the paint!
you know i was married and that my husband died. but what you don't know is i think he and i had bad luck.
i would now.
what? that was the best part of the old game.
no fucking way.
i thought perhaps as vice-president, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the massive financial loss ...
i got him.  i got the son-of-a-bitch. see, i was doing really good up till then. lots of street busts.  i've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  i got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  next thing i know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
what secret shall i tell?
oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  who are you? just another probie working for swayzak --
you've got a date right <u>here</u>, andy. this has got to...
we don't write up anything until we're done....
they suspended me for 100 years.
okay.
what?
i'll be back before you can say souffle.
mrs.  driscoll, if billy ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
whish the circumstances were different.
nothing further, your honor.
and yourself too in the process. god, you're so beautiful. why couldn't i see that before?
well, i'm a good teacher. the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. goodbye, fraulein, goodbye, madame! goodbye, sir!
dickens! the whole world's about to blow up and you're reading dickens?!
her brother.
agreed.
well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can i waver? no one shall say ninotchka was a bad russian.
dear, you're a scientist. don't you believe your own eyes?
i see...  ... and you are really a gardener, aren't you?
five thousand bucks.
i see you! riding pretty high, ain't you? look out you don't fall off.
i'll be there for you.  he won't try anything while i'm there.  i promise.  i'll protect you.
i wasn't hitting on your girl!
fascination...
i'm like you. i don't believe in vampires, but i believe in what i saw.
i know her friends.
i expect to try.
i'm not nick!  you thought you'd fuck him over?! well he's fucked you! i've never worked at some casino! i can't help you! because he's not me!
maybe plans changed...
so it's mr clean. wise up, jack, this whole business is bent. the casino is nothing but legal theft. and that's ok. it's the system. half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. we earn our money.  i'm on your side, jack. i don't need an enemy.
you! you're lucky i didn't fire you. i get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? a broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
can we charge admission?
as long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
let's try to be precise then. the word "torture" does not appear in our orders. we have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. as for the nlf, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... what type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
so you're the new meat?
that's not very kind.
you know it wasn't a joke, theo.
where do you think she's going?
they know jack will give them what they want once they have her.
let's just see how we do.
the deal still stands, our other thing.
all right then.
fine.  you know dr. schwartz retired last month?
someplace where no one knows her.  someplace strange and new.
what! what about the group and my singing career? what about me?
where he used to live. you can catch the riot squad -- it's just going out.
i -- i don't know, you can't ask me that.
but i have in india- every country presents problems.
what?
it'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, brad.  we'll cover it the way the "hickville gazette" covers the church social!  the names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  i tell you, brad, i envy you.  by bradford leland, the "enquirer's" special correspondent at the front. i'm almost tempted -
that's a crappy thing to say.
dark haired...
oh you do, do you? it is my dearest hope, doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
that sounds so great, man. yes. yes. hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
i make my end of the cash at 184,000.  now i'm trying to figure out the bonds.  what the face value is.
i stopped that!
... yes sir - elevator!
petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
you're moving away?  when?
how much longer before you can reach him?
come off it, bugs.
right.  i know --
your dad has two computer disks.  they have funny names:  marlon and al.
i do? oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. i have to confess something to you. i must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. i really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
i am not an aristocrat, as you are... but i must still respect a woman's duties.
it's me, chief.  can you talk?
i must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. everybody who goes there are toffs. they're all into that karma crap: `if i don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
all right... shoot!  i mean... what's on your mind?
that's the scar where i stabbed you! oh god... you deliberately took me down there so you could... god, i can't believe it!
yeah.  and it's better than not believing it their faces are inches apart.
tomorrow's possible. do you know dinelli's? piazza di spagna?
did we do it? did we make a difference?
why?
a beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the chinese.
you go. i don't want to get dressed yet. come back though. come back.  you know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
september '97, that's all she wrote.
you're my what?
that's not all we shared. it's disgraceful. you're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
and how do you know that?
you knew me as a kid.
real diamonds.  they must be worth their weight in gold.  are you always this generous?
just because he doesn't like americans!
not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  it is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
sam, if you're not doing anything new year's -- obviously you're not doing anything new year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  does that sound great or what?  i can't think of the last time i was at a party when anything actually happened.
all you've got is one life. i guess it's worth about the same to every body. you ever see an old woman after her husband has died? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  when you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. that's your whole future. that's as far as it goes. but imagine what those seconds are worth.
you take her to a doctor?
okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
lieutenant.
it's grand!
mr. williams . . .
you've thought of all this before. you know it isn't the leopard ——  don't you?
yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
in the cellar. buried under a stone in the floor.
so who are you?
doubt it.  he's dead.  the look out's a cemetery.
you don't believe in the force?
very well.
uh.  that's me.
hea<u>ther</u>, i've got something going with j.d.
yes?
oh, my holy stars! a negro!
sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
that's nice.  and you live in queens?  with a child, and a dog...?
how do you think i feel? you shit!
you havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
no!  wrong!  this man's name is robert paulson.
yes -- of course -- all i'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
okay ...
not really. i know how competitive it all is --
fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
mr. jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the united states government in connection with your testimony in this case?
no, i'm dumber than a goddamn slug. now can i please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
all right, then tell me how -
... among so many quiet qualities.
i know. i was there when she arrived.
what?
i'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide. they said... this one likes to skin his humps.
oh, not here.  there are too many people around.
i thought you'd never ask. the older one is janet, she's nine, and the younger one is morgan.
you know the other day i really wanted your reaction to how we did with the libyan report -- i was going to ask but i guess i feel a little intimidated with you.
i want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
we should get her out of here...
i can't write anything by tomorrow.
woodsman?
oh, no. she'll be crazy about it. well, see you later. i'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  goodbye. 
maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but i've got to try.
what're you nuts--
hey, i'm just waiting for cousin itt to show up.
don't ask what you can do. no coddling. life rolls on status quo.
is something wrong, stu? you seem so tense.
me? sure. why?
we have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
next time you try that, mr. mitchell...  ..don't. i'm warning you.
it's alright.
no.  it's not just how i felt toward jessica.  i've been cruel to even you.
nobody knows anything, believe me.
if you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like dad?  herb shuttle and norbert woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
<i>                      -- it's a bat. --              will it bend? -- it's a rat. --              will it break? -- perhaps it's the head that i found in the lake.</i>
mph rm. rmph rm rmph rm.
that's it?
you know i do!
i guess.
does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
you heard me - keep away from him
how do you do.  i mean ... excuse me ... i mean ...
what?
i'll see you tonight.
there was a lawyer. kobayashi.
jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. and when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
saddles.
...i heard he said... that's all... thanks.
you sure?
no goodbye.  no fuck you.  no 'are you in love with george?'
nothin'.  just stiffed those kids. don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
barks at his master.
brady's a booger and so are you!
i don't know.  end up in the electric chair?
well i'm so glad that you guys are.
you got any family?
i'll not see her, barbara. i promise.
tell ashley... i...
no! not the camera guy!
you rigged it...you spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
cunnilingus?
makes you look like a nun--
whoa-oh!  sorry, i...
i'm cynthia bishop.
i guess i would've felt sorry for the universe.
what's that?
you have to stop being so self- critical frida.
do you have a, ah, film called 'slave of love?'
you'll pardon me, norma? why don't you just sit and watch?  o.k.  here we go.
he can imitate anything, you just watch him.
i'm ye boy.
mmm... and to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
why are you here??
ahhh - no - stop - i mean janet.  janet.
what what? what advantages?
you're going to be busy all day long, edward.
i didn't mean it that way.  i meant only that i am not in a position to ask favors.
kirsty?
i worked ten years without one, i don't need one now.
soft and wet. that's very interesting.
you're weird.
you couldn't understand! listen, ten thumbs, i'll be on my way to washington in half an hour. whatever happens, i'm all ready for this ranger of yours. never mind how. you'll get your instructions from ken allen here. it isn't anything you have to do. i wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. allen'll do it himself. you just use your *high office* to help him get it done. understand?
oh, then you did hear from him?
no you weren't.
don't call me that confounded name.
i'm going to have a word with that asshole.
no.
my son has been sadly injured. who did this?
then fuckin' find it.  i'm going for the girl.
catherine tramell.  it's part of her game.
yes. a cow had died. one night, you stopped all your moving, and i said to your sister, "his time has come."
i'll get one more reading.
yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
beeeee careful.
those rockefellers!
michael myers.
she's doing like those iranians. `i divorce thee. i divorce thee. i divorce thee'
what are you, a theater checker? you check up on the box office girls. make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
you have no pants, sir.
jesus, are we on the air? jonah, for god's sake --
i don't have a girlfriend.
shut-up and get me off of here!
jack, i --
and what's steven's status?
we want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
c'mon, man, not in front of the baby. put on your seat belt before i get another ticket.
fuck...
bernie.
but he'll kill her!
i cannot.
i told you, no. i'm not that type.
thank you?
what?
i'll tell you what, if i'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, i'll let you know and we'll split the money.
really?
of course.  i don't want to scare you off.  not before i'm finished with you.
but sir, most of the people we are putting into the "park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. they are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
what safe place is that?
i haven't lost yet.
some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
damn.
okay.  fine.  we'll remain here until you get back.
what?
i can't... but like i told you, it's a number's game. the federation needs all the pilots it can get...
you're here for conrad van orton? i'm the hotel manager...
i got it!  i got it!!!
now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! cigarette smoking is the new holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the nazis of the nineties! he doesn't care how many people die from it! he smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "have a nice day."
i was thinking the poconos, charlie. maybe vegas.
there won't be any this week.
how long?
hey, i'm here.
yes you do...
yeah, now listen.  i can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. you go down get yourself something to drink. make sure godzilla there, follows you.
this is about freedom of speech, stan, about censorship.
that's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
all i'm saying is, i think we should go slow here.
uh-huh.
not long.
how much did they get from the safe?
you know, he's been wanting a mitt.
yeah?  what about the other five guys?  the five before me?  what about them?
susan, dr. argon is giving you an opportunity here.
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv. thunder rumbles. theo takes sheila by the shoulders.
where are we now?
business appointment. i'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
really. how'd it go?
i take it... you can prove that car's yours... i mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
i was wrong.
exactly -- you'll go up the nung river in a navy p.b.r. -- appear at nu mung ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with colonel kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. then terminate his command.
what's that?
she was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
it's your best play, nicky.
i don't know.....
i don't know.
you knew him best.
thank you. having fun?
how?
you okay?
where. up joey's ocarina. didn't you know?
i got no idea of love. and neither have you. i mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
i'm afraid so.
r was worried about you  you didn't even call. you're always on my case if i don't call..
you appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  you're in the red-hot center of big business and i thought you were a regular joe.
huh?
i was going to talk to bembry about it tonight.
come in, come in, siddown over there. coffee?
oh my. oh,my, oh my, oh, my. so, what do we do now?
you'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
must you fight him?
you're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? we're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
that's the hair color in his profile?
mm?
oh, god, what did you do?
yes.  seriously.
a wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... there is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
you don't have to defend him to me, mary -- i've been called names myself.
after that.
it was bob. his walkie talkie's busted.
i don't need a little.  i need a lot.
that's rache's song!
why are there two ottomans?
coffee'd be nice.
there's nothing in the trunk, sheriff.
i'm looking for my nephew,  thomas.
what’s in it for me? where are my mary janes?
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
but i said i was sorry....
but it could be anywhere.
i want to hear the truth.
didn't you see it? he lifted me up and crashed me down.
oh, that'll be all right, hildy. go ahead, run it. and you can say i treated him well, too.  'lo, earl. how are you feeling?
watch it, partner, watch it!
i know who you are, mr crane.
oh, sure. great.
i'm sorry, i know. i know that it's....
i want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
i think he's dead!
don't be such a pussy.
good luck.  you're going to use up all your help vouchers.
why would i do it?
spec-recon.  those guys are world- class warriors.  and they will not want you there, jordan.
wow! they're so quiet.
you like him? he worships you.
maybe not... i don't know.  i'm not sure i'm gonna go.  she doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
whewwww! you sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
what?
i've done that already. he should appear, you know.  it doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
we millionaires yet?
no one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. the rest we just want.
i'm nothing but a body with a voice. no mind.
rip my face off? hey, we all make mistakes. hell, i didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. but i did, and now i'm paying the price.
please, boss, let's go. ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
good work. the download?
male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
i know. when the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
that's right!
your what...?
no three-way stretch? how very un- chic.
sure
i don't want you to hurt you. i'll be gentle.
we don't mess with accessories.
what's wrong with your face?
nothing.
you're too quick for me.
yes.
same sector. metallic mass.
i don't know you and i got nothing to say to you.
those comics -- they never got the eyes right.
you can't bribe me!
if my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... the weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary? it's his fantasy, too.
if we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes.
you know that's not what's upsetting me.
i swear to you that's all that happened.  i haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
chart says he's from new york.
your last chance. give me the name.
you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
yes.
and when i finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
that's not what i meant.  i don't care about the sword.
wasn't it!
oh i been out.
what did you to do him, michael? why did he bite you?
well we--i don't--
well, i'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. you can sleep through it.
i don't finish till eight. make it nine and you're on.
you scared me.
no, no. when you play for me, i pick up all the tabs.
of course you will.
i know, sugar... but while the place was burnin'... before santos came out - i pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... afterwards... when i met you, i always liked to think i mighta saved your life.
she can't be wrong.  she's a very very very powerful sorceress.
visiting hour ends at eight thirty. i'll just sit with him; i want to show respect.
you and 'honey'?
...you? do you remember what i told you?
i'm here.
you think i should quit?!
you'll visit again?
please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? we don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
and aren't you pleased?... that way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
long ago.
does one exist?
mattress police. there are no tags on the mattress. i'm going to have to take you downtown. please give me your weapon.
what does that mean?
don't try to be a policeman, old man.
yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "epidemic! epidemic! you're all going to die!"
mr. crawford... can those cops down there handle dr. lecter?
i was taken from my homeworld by people called the "pakjeds." they are fat. they traded me to a ship belonging to the "bolians." the "bolians" are blue. they put me in a seat and asked me questions. then they were attacked by another ship...
so you have claimed. yet you have no explanation for this.  the locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. the locket you so coveted.  how did it come to be in your possession?
walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for?
fuck your hot chocolate, rudy.
what does that even mean? anyway, i got to thinking on the way over. i was thinking maybe i could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. you know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. or some nice lesbos.
fish are all over the water...come on, let us take a boat out.
she eats him alive and he takes it.
hospital clean.
give me his home number.
yeah. you're a mystery. i like you. very much.
i just couldn't stand seeing him again.
it's been a long time, ma.
we can't do this.
yes. i'll go. yes.
but it still doesn't make them saints. they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. well, just like me. can't they?
you're not a team player.
and a lot of time.
because the assigned curriculum is boring.
me too. that's why i fight so hard.
you want something?
what?
find the father.  that should clear things up.
he's around someplace.
you know i'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the army ...
tom?
and it stinks to high heaven in here.
i have to qualify, is that it?
they were proving to her they weren't. they were very drunk. things were different back then. you think kids are sexually bottled up today....
<u>no</u>, <u>i</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  the crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. but it was all... it was a mistake.
i didn't do anything.
charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
what do you want?
what do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
i am done with theatre. the playhouse is for dreamers. look where the dream has brought us.
if it's on the level.
get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for amsterdam...
crash, i get wet just thinking about you.
you... you wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
just a few then. the big ones.
i'll do it.
walter, come off it.  you're not even fucking jewish, you're--
they fuckin' wit' her. they callin' it possession with intent. a black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit intent. same shit happened to a movie star. it's possession.
to me he seems rather nervous.
don't fucking humor us.  we're not in the mood.
nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
i've learned so much since then.  and i'll return to finish ... i promise that, master.
better.
pamela landy, again. where do we stand?
you! and she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
as an unmuddied lake, sir. clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. you can rely on me, sir. deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. he groans and retches.
we always help our friends, don't we?  it is no secret that the government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. there are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. the press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
you have nothing to hide.
yes, miles. i accept.
ohio is cold ground. picked over, ten months ago. our people worked it, so did the locals.

i wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
well.  he doesn't think it's god, but for different reasons than me. he's thinking: if i can figure out how to make it stop, than i am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be god.
no hospitals.  i'll fix this myself if i have to.
gee, i better not, if it's okay. i still gotta drive back up to los ang-gleez.

some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
it's two-point-five, george.  i am sure.

no!  don't let go... you mustn't!  i love you!
like i was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
you know what i mean, you don't even know him!
washington thinks it's too late for that.
i guess i've got wander in my blood.
i'd like to hear that too. turn around and put your hands on your head.
the neighbors from hell.  the kind that lay in wait.  i'd rather move actually. wouldn't i?  wouldn't i?

well, i was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night i meant to tell you before you went out with the richards - and i guess i was asleep when you got home...
one toy per kid is doing something nice. four is ... something else.
goodbye, mr. gillis.
you see -- it means 'yes.'
but then when she got into it. she really got into it. it was good.
now... you go home.
you could tell she took care of herself. she had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
shhh.
it's a lovely garden.
no, no. not at my hotel. i, uh, i have things to do in the city before i leave. i'll meet you at the station, huh?
yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
it's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. you take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
in the confessional.
this is so patronizing.
describe for me your first sexual experience.
what?
you couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
...then...
what are you going to do now, tom?
next, you dial a number.
oh, my god, you're right!  i'm on the one...  well, let's scoot...
well, nothin'.
this is my place and you can't have it.
opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
no, buddy, i'm the one he wants.
i'm your friend.
aye, sir.
i'm not gonna bring it up to him.
from la rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in america.  this is orange, from real seville oranges.  lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. and a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
ten dollars? let's grab a highball!
we like you.  at least the computer at langley likes you.  pulled your file because of various factors.  service record. area familiarity.
seldom? no kidding?
meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
yes. i think he would have.
was that you? i remember that. i was only three or four, but i always heard about it growin' up.  they say you're well?
alright. i will not come. provided one thing.
did you see him?
i better go check on them.
that's it!  no man lives who can call a firefly an upstart.
frank?
okay.
you hear me, girl?
thanks.
you sure it belongs to his wife?
they said he was drunk.
like that merchant-ivory clap-trap. all those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
now, just a minute—you can't—
okay. i know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
leo, i was trying to impress a skirt.  you know me, i'm non- political.  republican, democrat, communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
ah, they just don't know you the way i do.
um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
what kept you?
thanks, i appreciate that.
so signor miles drove away and you did what?
yes. yes.
oh, you know, the usual.  bowl. drive around.  the occasional acid flashback.
uh-huh.  well, miss moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
i can't believe you didn't check.
from glades to the turnpike.  then i left with glenn.
it looks like a bomb's dropped.
these seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
in over your head?
-- i wanted to be him. right then i wanted to be him more than anything...
a real turd.
no. ohmygod, pritchett was right -- the house <u><b>is</b></u> haunted.
huh?
don't tell him i told you--he'd break my neck.
i appreciate that.
you're supposed to guess.
i stand for honesty! i stand for some level of truth!
i'm here.
the little girl's name.

'cause harlin used to own it.
get some perspective, lowell.
half-red, half-black--
sire.
james. listen. things -- things are a little weird with me right now and i -- well --i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. and if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. that's why i need you to go home. understand?
... what... ?
what?
i... i just want you to be happy, mary.
promise me, benjamin.
yes, i know.  you are a good woman.
calm down, frances.
yeah. i'm fine. it didn't hurt.
about goddamn time.
he's comin' back? what for?
but what if they serve soup?
better late than never.
he did. i've seen him.
i always liked the west, west of il- linois anyway. but you gotta give me time to pack.
i should.  i've been doing it half my life to humans.
then don't.
sister, if i knew the answer to that i sure as hell wouldn't be here.
because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
meaning you didn't like it.
okay. listen, i cancelled the tickets for fabian. i thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, chez tres.
i asked him.
she's all i've got.  she's the only witness.
or the future, oh, no, no, i mean... i mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
always good advice.
how? you got any horses, or money to buy 'em...you ain't even got money to buy cartridges...jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
if he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
who?
what are you doing?
yes. that's why i wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
turn around quick!
take your hand off my shoulder right now.
walter!
it was just an idea.
that's right...
you should get upset. everyone should get upset. when, when hitler was greasing the jews, people were saying, "don't get me upset. your bumming me out." my duty as a human being is to be pissed off. jesus christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. nothing ever changes, man. fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. and then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. it's all so fucking futile.
heard of him.
jungle plants in the arctic? a lush english village transformed overnight into african scrubland? blizzards in summer?
hablar slowly, por favor.  my ingles no es bien.
sam, haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. how could he get there? he can't drive.
and what if you get killed?
any activity?
death first!!
some cash. jewelry. the other stuff i can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. they're the only ones i have of her.
it was a very impressive offer. fancy offices, a big home... i'd be treated like a king.
oh really -- i don't think so.  uh, amber, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. and this...  this is why we have the rule. my goodness gracious, i couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. we have kids in the audience.
and a lot more. can we talk?
i wish i could, paul. try to hold out.
never! never! i'll never forget you. i wanted to marry you. don't you understand! i love you. i love you!
how do you know?
who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  maybe good help is hard to find.
colonel. is uhm--is otis in?
hope you don't mind, captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  coming?
what's your name?
actually, it was two.  you're different, officer white.  you're the first man in five years who didn't tell me i look like veronica lake inside of a minute.
i don't have love handles.
this is a legitimate cinematic genre. just like westerns, comedies, film noire, science fiction...
i guess that's for the best.
all right.  i know you didn't ask me.  you didn't ask me but i did it.
really, i feel fine, sir.
as friends? we'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
if she is, the machine works.
..."and i won't never tell about the money."
i'm the one you want!  penguin, please!  ask yourself:  isn't it max shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  isn't it max, not chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
ask her yourself.
i can't see them!
laura, i'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
so you've heard all those stories about me. well, i can assure you they're not true. and if they were true, i've retired.
well, i wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
let's go.
who knows?
is llewelyn there?
i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
it's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
she's in the holding cell, on this floor.
me?
oh, i'm not finished.  "when he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  as i said. hmm.
you did good, massey!
jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the state legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
you've got the wrong idea about me. i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger.  can you help me find him?  i'll pay you anything.
oh, mom's okay. they're just givin' her a ride back. she almost blew outta the back of loretta's pick-up on the way over.
... you're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
you find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
you have all this talent, and you waste it. you won't take a single endorsement deal. meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! but no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
i thought we were finished with this bullshit.  this is police work, not the psychic hot line.
what exactly is he charged with?
you were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
what's he talking about?
when's he coming back...?
not sometimes.  always.  just because it is the hard way.  you're that kind of man, jeff.
we're not.
all of what dewey?  you do know something, don't you?
get that car the hell away from here, now!  i spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  but this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
i'm done.  find another cab.
don't fake me out, clark.  or whoever you are.
not everyone, miss daniels.
just say it, dad.
out!
it's lynn.
know what?
well, stone -- have you got the money?
peter, this is serious.  i need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
so baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow after the night there's a brand new day. and there'll be no pain and no more sorrow. so wash your face and phone my place it'll be o.k.
benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
partners.
don't blame yourself. in your shoes, i don't think i would have told parker, either.  so do you think grimes has become the dominant personality?
i was on the 'dukes of hazzard' set about eight years ago.
it's not real?  crain?  he's not real?
i'm very interested in that body.
over there -- that's ricky tan.
c'mon. talk to me. tell me what you're thinking.
don't thank me.  it was entirely simone's decision.  do you have simone's check?
oh my god! he ripped out his -- he killed him!
yeah, it's frass canyon. it's a joke.
be specific.
no...  no doctor...
you're right. we should sit in silence.
decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, mister worf.
jim, don't.  you're scaring him.
what for -- you wanna play hide the salami with his old lady?
i sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  that son of a gun...!
crap. it's not relative. it's unfair. like your casino. it's designed unfair. and your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
gobble, gobble, gobble.
neat. goodnight!
come in out of the rain.  in the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
all 900.
they'll kill you, you know they will. besides, there is no back door. keep smiling. ready? now.
did you hear me?
wait! please wait!  i'll make a deal with you!  i'll give you a rogers hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
outside, around back. next to the water tank.
isn't it? whose is it?
yes.  it's faster.
hold up, hold up, i'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
i was dead, too.
so kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, maria... and blew the whistle on you. suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. but, up to this point, you've been their golden boy, their rising star... their behavior is... inconsistent.
there is something i want.  a friend.
vampires, mom!  everywhere! you've got to tell the police! the newspapers!  the tv stations! they'll listen to you.  they'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
you're a celebrity, john.  people are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
you should come into the shelter.
i'm loving this. it's such a treat to be out and about. what a wonderful invention a city is. the immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
and you never knew why?
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
there's still tomorrow morning.
you took my class in la. you had the best high kick i've ever seen. are you one of my lawyers?
sure.
huh huh. get out of the way, beavis, i wanna sit by the window. huh huh.
yeah, pretty well.
i thought "clark kent has a really nice voice." you didn't even know i was there.
try that one.
i recognize you from the news photographs, monsieur laszlo.
i don't know why you feel you have to lie, letty.
i changed my mind, early. i'm not gonna climb up that hollywood sign with you... i decided. i think your mean, and you hurt people.
it's all i could think of.
ah, the direct approach.  i admire that in a man with a mask.  but you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
let's talk about you.
who?
no rules!  you cabbage-eating sons- of- bitches--
black.  no sugar.
what do we do? get some help? radio in?
no, they don't, do they?
you ride like a comanche.
okay.
i don't care if helen of troy walked into that bar! that's game six of the world series!
i wanted some fresh air, robert. how is mr. gardiner?
fine piece of engineering.
my son... my mind...
well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
i think you're trying to tell me something.
you are?
why?
you got to be under twenty-five -
give me your checkbook then.
yeah. to watch the world go by.--
no, i gotta do something.  i don't suppose you'd card-
i don't have one really. most of the time i'm faking it. see, i think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time i hear about them. the most i can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. if i can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, i can help them out a little.
still think we're finished?
"humoresque"? i'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
it's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. what do you think it is? it's lasagne.
arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
i almost didn't.
i ain't got no money to get 'em with but i bet vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
it's a fortune box.
have to talk about something.
i don't expect an apology and i don't even want one. i just want us to --
that's following a train of thought.
oh, that's nice.
lois, i really don't see why --
where are you?
sid!!!
shurrup, cheerful.
lansky. meyer lansky. and that's bugsy siegel ya got there.
yes, sir.
vindication.  how would you like to get some?  a chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say aa, okay?
...don't get all...
s.o.p..
that's a nice shirt.
you bet.
ok!
cici. who's this?
edgar william jacobi, aka william edgar bright, a.k.a. moloch.
okay, matt.
unfortunately, no.
yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. but if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
fucking out of order, that.  shouldn't be allowed.
someone named hockley, i should imagine.
hey, remember?  you don't need my help, madmartigan.  little rabbit trap like this?  come on!  i could open it for you, but i wouldn't wanna insult you!
you know about this stuff?
look ... where's this going? what do you want me to do?
that's easy. there was. he's dead.
it's better this way. if we were rescued jason would just get off the ship. you want him on your precious earth ii?
i thought everything was working out fine.
no -- that is a power reserved to the almighty spirit.
right as rain.
sorry.
yeah, like people in love.
the back door was open.
the brunette.  the one you told me about.
i just work for the travel firm.
...i dunno.
all right. how much is pepsi here?
bill didn't say - but lloyd was beside himself. he listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
curly.
they said you were drunk.  why don't you tell her the truth?
you shouldn't have.
-- i don't deserve this.  i'm still young, this is not my time --
i need a sample of your blood. what do your borg friends say? resistance is futile. 
put the pension funds on hold until i say otherwise.
we'll work it out. what's this committee you talkin' about?
no, i'm sorry. i'm really backward in certain areas.
and what makes you think you killed a man?
rod, get on the camel.
it does, it does if it's the version signed 'i still can't help loving you'.  read that.
isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
in looking at your books, i've discovered that ...
how many men have i talked to?
by remembering that i serve others, not only myself.
hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work i go!
yeah!  like me!  i don't choke on my own gall - i fight back!  let them choke, not me!
god, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what i <i>can't</i> do. in case you hadn't noticed, anton, i don't need rescuing.  but <i>you</i> did, once.
roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
we won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
i've discovered something about lindenmeyer'5 maestro teaching tool i thought you should know...  the harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
like how?
you're a little angle, you are.
but where will you go?  we're in the middle of nowhere.
no. but tell him i would.
right in front of the room.
dr. marcus, it's your planet.
that's a nice name for what you need...
naturally.
certainly not.
please.  don't.
eddie, come on.
what can i do? except maybe pass out?
you've lost your cause
search your feelings, father. you can't do this. i feel the conflict within you. let go of your hate.
you know the best thing about being a skipper is the worst thing.  it's all my responsibility.  so i'll tell you what george, you stay off of my bridge, and i'll stay out of your galley.  we'll get along that way.
the problem, starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was grant.
jackie - what are you talking about?
all right if i look around your lobby?
you know, flip, vietnam war was fought because of a bet howard hughes lost to aristotle onasis.
oh. fine.  it was nothing.  couple sore knuckles.  nothing.
let's move out!
that's more than you already owe me. what happens if you fuck this up?
maybe i better start working on him.
yes.
go, chief.
are you making fun of me? i won't be mocked. do you hear me? i won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
isn't that lulu?
now hold on, you dumb...
only two ways i know to leave here early.  one is to escape.
you really don't need anyone?
no, it's weird, man. nobody knows where he went.
the same. as you would say today... bull shit.
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country.
listen, captain cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  but those boots are unforgivable. what is it with men?
she's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
wow. i have to give this some thought.
not without leeloo.
we will start work on it now sir.
his schwanzstucker.
shut up, will you?
well, all reet, then.
ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.

understand?  i'm sorry.
she did not do it... please listen...
you're fucking polish catholic--
you weren't even alive!
they scare me too sometimes.
what?... maybe... no... i dunno...
sir, i ain't feeling so chipper on account of wade.
quake knocked you off your feet.  you got bumped pretty good, actually. 
it always is.
what are you talking about?
i wouldn't be trying, beloved. i would hang him! and another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months. doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
y'know, you're not in england yet, you know that of course, and by the way, i want to just tell you that i lived in england for a few months,
john, he's got my driver's license.
we just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, i guess...
you wouldn't believe me.
you know what mr. white said. a photographer always goes after a story.
yes, yes!
why don't you go check it out?
mulder -- what are you doing?
until pa gets around to driving us to minden.
first things first.
oh, some years ago i heard my mother talking about it. but is it true?
i'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- i shall die on the gallows.
no, ma'am.
oh god, i'm so glad, robert, that you're coming...
huh. st. bernard's. figures it's named after a canine.
bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when i left the office. it might spin up to 25 by the bell...
it's a hoax.  i knew it!
good.  now take the forceps, and remember, vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  i've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  there are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
c-a-m-e-m...?
there's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. did you know about that? there's an answer mother. that's how she got out.
yes, sir. three times.
hi, darling.
yeah, i guess it is, boy. just you and me.
now let me get this straight. the aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
you can heat them up and eat with him.
he was i.a.  he probably asked her about it.
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  but suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
hi, dad.
you make me sound like the father in "east lynne."
i was catching up with bob destephano.
have enough fun for the both of us.
you mean the lunch room?
she just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - i thought maybe she was...
i only want one.
so what makes you so special?
lucy'd kill me if she knew.
good.  this is the turn of luck i have been waiting for.
you're part of the mining guild then?
good.
you got absolute zero.
yes. i can live in or out just as you wish.
watch yourself!!
okay.
how are you, rhian?
no, that's okay, i'll do it now.
no.
who, laddie?
oh. maybe i should, too--
would you, tell the guy, get the a.d., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, i want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  you want...
i ain't drinking hot piss with you. come on, sam.
does johnnie hit on you?
you got a nice tan, though.
after this job, i'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
burbage says you have a play.
how many?
this is our boy...!
you're lovely.
yes.
i dunno.
no... i am looking for the eiffel tower.
c'mon, valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  i mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place?
what is it, my son?
well, we all got to go sometime.
even there?
no!....
they're mine. the one with the moustache is my brother. they stay out of it. we stay clean.
what for paul.
explain how that works.
oh, god! i'm going to die!
"o, no, it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
you say the truth.  go ahead. don't be afraid. you want to win the game, don'tcha?
is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
he was by the book, all the way.
tons
and he'll talk?
who?
i don't know.
huh? yah?
nellie fox.  walter likes the past.  and he likes the little guys.
there's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
not for long, boy. i've outstayed my welcome already.
and her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
everything go?
the one you're blocking. this is the last chance i have -- i'm flying back to paris this afternoon. what's your name?
you're always so coarse... "do her right here." let's just see what happens, okay?  "i wish that i could find a way; to speak my thoughts on mother's day. there are no words that quite express; my gratitude or happiness. a pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; i would not fail to give her this. i'd make her glad the whole day through; by sayin' 'mother', i love you!' p.s. i wish i could say this to my mother's face, but i can't anymore."
so you are going to talk me to death.
i thought you said you were doing to break it off.
she knows where i live and breathe. she's coming after me.
oh, right, sorry.
salut, laurent. ouais. it wasn’t easy but i got what you wanted through interpol. say, what’s your business with these spitzes?
i'm doing all right.
but you're the gods!
get it.
no. no one never did.
there've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
when i'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? tell me the truth.
walter, for christ's sake!  he's crippled!  put him down!
is that all? can i go now?
i never saw him. why didn't he show up?
this is a private club. you're not welcome.
who?
fuck, yeah!  i told you so.  and you can tell'em all i told you so.
cuz once in a while soil need a change. corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. so next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. that give off a lot of nitrate. change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  sting a bit?
a man traded with me -- all those for only four.
we're all very proud of you, harry, but what the hell is it?
the exotic women.
well what do i tell him?
yes, i know.
tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
yeah.
y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  we're stepping on their toes of this one.
those things bring juice to the new stations.  you just can't rewire that shit...
what?
in a casino. as a croupier. a dealer.
my name is taylor.
has he eaten anything at all?
well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! you should be dating local boys.
that sets it off.
i ain't talkin' about you, i'm talkin' about me. and i'm a-stayin'. i give her a good goin' over all night long-- and i'm a-stayin'.
uh-huh.
life! -- mr. kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
yeah, i got the key, so i come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
what are you doing?
oh no?
time to check out the waiters.
you met him. walt waldowski, the dental officer.
i don't know.
it's been a while.
hit it.
cut it out!
i don't know.
you see--governor hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. he's here to see monuments--and pass the time. that's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. so, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
yes.
watch and see.
ha. ha.
you have a job?
man.  fuck you guys.  i have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
thank you.
that's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  now may i suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  now back to the typewriter.
and, miss mitchell—i think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
i like that, too.  look, j.j., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  we're going great, but please play it my way. i cased this kid. know his ins and outs...he's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  do little sidney a favor: squeeze! - you know, j.j. - the porcupine bit - needles.
later for sal.  y'know, sometimes i think you're more concerned with him than me.
if i give it to you, will you let us go?
just about anything, you know. it can be funny or... not. just tell me somethin'.
oh, really: who?
you are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
is he big league?
hmmm.
i'm more comfortable around my people.
the best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. the masterpiece. it is the most valuable stamp in the world. it is called 'the gazette guyanne.' it was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  today it has a value of $100,000.  eh, bien -- i am not a thief. i knew there was some mistake. take them.
a psychiatrist?!
oh, cut the crap!
what?
if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
yeah. i'm awake.
i think it's exciting.
yeah. and no more tommy reina.
what d'you mean?
i wasn't toying with her, sir. i was just... how old are you?
why, because you're my security consultant?  this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
yeah.
oh, hi.  i'm fine, sara.  my god, a voice from the past!
he's an asshole.
you've lived with me for two years.
i want him back!
what i'm trying to say, mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? ain't much we can do about it. 
you keep that up carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like mr. skinner here. what do you think, theo? think carmelita's got the stuff?
a murderer?
more like jenny is after every man she sees.
really?
from the parapets most likely.  the men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
oh - draw on my imagination, i suppose.
no... don't...
it's broke i guess. there's an electric in the bedroom.
that right?
a true friend would do it.
no, baby. he wants me.
well, i was born to be a mother. some of us are.
man, he won't like that. beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
oh -- of course. i think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
it certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
how would you know <u>anything</u>?
you're in check.
i just want to pick up my divorce papers. for the lawyer. it won't take long.
sure...
jesus. don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. they'll think you're a moron.
i'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
do you remember the last time you saw him?
thank you.
just some peroxide. i want to clean out the cut.
give -- me -- your -- hand!
just to see you. that's all.
it's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  we sometimes hang out there, you know....
sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
well, you said that.  you've got a lot of references from leonardo da vinci, don't you?
good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
you should be shocked. or do you get off on this shit?
hey, it's cool. hallie's into it, i'm into hallie...
you know very well who it is that i love.
no one available.
oh.
what?
this rae... you get with her?
well, i guess i've told you almost everything there is to tell. my folks live in a small town near hartford. i'm down here alone trying to make a living.  oh, i'm really just a nobody.
i'll get her.  have a good christmas, matt....
she don't know shit about the money.
they like dr. pepper.
thank you, spearchucker. i'll certainly take a look at these. where the hell did you ever get that name?
oh, nicky, i've missed you. come on out and say hello...
no, i couldn't do that.
we're here.
yup.  they must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
right.
if you're worried about mary and me talkin' too much, don't. no matter how many questions your old man asks. we know how to keep our mouths shut.
i've seen it before.
why tell me this?
shut it, man. shut it. tom is a square. he don't but dabble in shit. maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an austrian passbook account.
in the godfather, after the courtroom scene, frankie pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
how the fuck do i know?!
don't ever stare him down.
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
exactly! i thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
yes.
then leave.
he will.
all right, we'll take jeff with us--
come with me.
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
good night.
out!
barrytown.  barrytown?  is there no end to your arrogance?
they mean, pig!, that the black panther party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  we are going to shoot you!!!
i wanted a career. didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
i wish i were like you. look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
did anyone see you there?  i mean did they get your license number or anything?
a hanger.
~don't shoot, g-men..."
what's happened is freak luck.
lina, come here!
look, kicks, how long have we known each other?
that's very good jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
i used to play this piece back in high school.
well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. understand, little brother?
and is that the most horrible thing in the world?
if i knew, cledus; i'd be on college bowl.
how old are you?
oh, yeah.  so what're you gonna major in?
well, shoot it on the last day.
they have him in the lobby, go quickly.
yes.
where'd you read all that stuff?
here's your steak. you can't wait for it to be done. here.
uhh... bacon.
spoken words?
you got it back, eh? there's something funny going on around here.
i don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
i thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
we went to code blue...
now i know you're lying.
not a big music fan, eh?
your classmates?
 he's going to kill fanucci.
what happened to me?
i'll do.
yes, sir, but i can get him...
what have we missed?
no, you don't!
it doesn't matter what he's going through. that's the whole purpose of this zoo. what matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
but, jake, i was just...
what do you think?
why me?
how's that been?
i'm gonna slit my wrists.  cut my throat.  for the love of joseph.
who the fuck are they?  bob, are you working on revoking the posts's television license?  good.
i've got to run along.  thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
and get that finger out of your ear. you don't know where that finger's been! gunderson?
why, i guess so.
i thought of something.....
i did.  i did, reed...but i wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
i won't make any noise.
observation, mainly. clinical study. you were one of the survivors.
...it's cold outside, paulie.
that's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
i didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, mr. howard.
i did it.
i don't want it reported!
yes. [beat] it has. everything up 'till today is done. everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
dad's like doing his up with people routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
thank you, madame de beauharnais. you probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at paul's house.
forget it, doll.  after all, you work here - i work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
i guess we'll just have to evolve too.
you've been the man in mine.
what?
he whispered it in my ear.
only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
yes.
good... good boy. oh yes, i understand you're fond of music. i have arranged a little surprise for you.
i'll offer you more than it's worth. and you know you won't have to move. nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
no.
that ain't the way they're tellin' it. they're sayin' you done it fust.
back to jail in my own car.  ganz got away. got all my money. it just don't seem right.
angelo, we gotta talk.
tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
...i got lost, mister.
what happened to them?
i wasn't told. i just knew it.
thank you, but i really have to go.
you wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
vanessa, right?
it's two weeks.
nothing of the kind. karen and i had a nice talk.
no, you may wait behind the screen.
it feels wrong, jack... like a trap.
what do you hate most?
fandango, junior.  i'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
i asked them to give me a couple minutes...
did you suggest any?
hey, you smell that?  smells like something died.
oh really? nothing? my dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
alone or surrounded?
i'd like that very much.
why not?
are you going to kiss me?
what a question... because i want to be with you, naturally. i hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... isn't this water wonderful!
i got it on sale.  a real steel.
no, 1995 is the past.
k through sixth.
no, nancy.	you've got to sleep two more minutes.
and?
i know. weird, huh -- ?
it's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
i'm not going.
want a pair of boots?
gotcha george, not a problem. tomorrow. hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
he don't look wise.
time is of no importance, mr. president. only life is important.
i warned you...  ...but i'm sorry.
i don't know who i am.
what are you gonna do? fight with him?  he wants his money.
it's comin' along... want a beer?
no!  not the knights who say "ni"!
don't start with me again.
that's the past.  it's dead.
baxter, i picked you for my team because i thought you were a bright young man. you realize what you're doing? not to me -- but to yourself. normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. you dig?
lady viola is…young in the world. your majesty is wise in it. nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. i'll wager my fortune.
mmm.
‘that which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
yes. i know. it's exactly how i felt when i realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
enough! you better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. we're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
no.
yep.
dead on all channels.
luke.  can't live like that.
but you don't keep a cat, do you?
i run him off.
not likely i am afraid; i don't think i'll be seeing them again.
wyatt, i know what i'm doin'.
drunk isn’t the same thing as happy, amy.
he never did want to. i figure he ain't changed his mind much.
desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
patrick?
who?
normal. average.
the locks.
oh-oh. holly  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  she's schizophrenic.
yes. i think it'll look better.
i feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
the dangerous man, caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
well, no...but...
is scary.  but you want it.  gimme some truth here.
died?
couldn't make the last edition. it'd take me four hours to translate your story into english.
i'll get it, jabez.
who gives a shit what he calls himself?
were you listening?  we got two officers in the hospital.  yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  look at him!  still on his feet.
yes, but i'm going to live at home.
he's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
jealousy is so unattractive.
i don't know. who was that guy that used to talk about soze in new york?
whoa...whoa...wait a second, jack.  you’re not actually gonna cheat on kate?
you must be quite a girl.
please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
huh?
hey, you and tommy lasorda. that's great.
who the hell's manolete?
jack carter.
yes.  great.  kevin, i'11 send bean in to keep you company.
just diggin'.  i ain't ever gonna be happy now. not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. i wish me and you and mama could just run away. but she said he would find us wherever we went. he's crazy. sometimes i think it would of been better if i wadn't ever born.
can you really tell from doing that?
you not with probation, one of those?
what the fuck are you doing here?
it's a yacht.
well, as long as i admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
how do you do that?
it's against your rules that i try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  who's...
i'll find her.
i can't say he's been all that effective with her.
good morning, mr. dickson.
yeah.
it's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
you're an asshole, moran.
i'm hanging up right now.
jenny greenteeth?  who's she?
no!...
course heading, captain?
let me tell you somethin', boy! i don't care if both of my legs was cut off! i can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
and i'm gonna finish my drink. and, i'm gonna have a good time, because i ain't doing nothing wrong.
one more.
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
holly.
well, we have to end apartheid for one. and slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. but we can't ignore our social needs. either we have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. we have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
it's not that --
who am i, david blane?
no. i want to know what you think about besides ditching smokey?
that's helms.  he's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
a call box? that’s odd. where exactly?
collect me?
just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
be polite. say hello.  this is candy.
hey.
you think i wouldn't remember a thing like that?
but bob isn't real.
sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
here in buenos aires.
no, i was happy, but i just didn't realize i was happy.
the feds would be onto you in a month.
i was sorry to hear about your father. i know your mother from church. it's such a shame.
shut the fuck up.
hell's angels four to big duke six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the fac mark it.
hey, animal! animal!
i just want to have something that's mine, you know ? it's like living off of their money is fun and all. there are certain materialistic needs that i have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
behind you!
it's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
sure.  every bunco man in the country knows gondorff.
there's a store around the corner, i'll be right back.
none at all? how about those 'underground' comics?
you get the idea.
why did you quit?
he knows better than that.
i sprayed your apartment. i took your key. i really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
gimme some room here, will you?  back off.  gimme some space.
it's not.
overnight.  what about just now?
good.
so they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  forget it. meyerling's right -- i'm a dinosaur.  greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
as i said i have some j-j-j-j-  that i might wish t-t-to sell and i wanted an estimate--
we do not take tips.  i'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
you got it, a great spender of other people's money.
mr. lingk and i are going to...
--i'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
thanks, binky.  can you see bromdingna island yet?
...his majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
no, sergeant -- not history...  eternity...
please don't play governess, karen, i haven't your unyielding good taste, i wish i'd gone to radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  i'm being rude now, aren't i? or should i say "ain't i"?
just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. she'll be all right.
and we all went through that together?
it's gorgeous.  just my taste. i've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry i liked.  thanks. so let's get going. long drive.
aren't they?
there's no end to your accomplishments.
home! meet me at the office. we've got to do something ... you've got to do something adam!
call for help, and you'll live.  but, you'll be disfigured.  or, put yourself out of your misery.
they're true!  everything i said! witholding that veto was treason!
alice... i...
an injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...then he quits...same when he runs...seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...so we'll find them in the end, i promise you that...we'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
let a thousand flowers bloom. chairman mao.
i guess you could say i wasn't thinkin', captain.
no! no, thank you!
yes.  and a much nicer one than ours.
so... alright.  what terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
j. edgar hoover plays sports.
how do you know?
don't cause a scene. no one's trying to win any 'rounds'. don't make it any worse.
marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
a way to hook this helmet into the game. i'm sure there are interfaces...
it's nice to meet you, jessica.
oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. took care of my little sisters. sit down. so where's carlos?
bullshit.
because he was a <u>real</u> hero, chucky. he was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  he didn't expect the media to lionize him.  he didn't expect a million dollar reward. he saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. he was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to laplante....  for how much, laplante?  a couple of bucks?  did you give him enough for a decent meal?
ray nicolet with alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.
the perfect couple, i should say.
sometimes.  but, just when i think your father's changing for the better, i realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  he took the credit for simone tonight.
what?
yes i did. you asshole! what about the room?
oh, now don't get all jealous, ed.  i got a little something for you, too.
was i alright, sir? did i do well, sir?
as you wish.
i'm endangering the mission. i shouldn't have come.
it's utterly beautiful.  i wish i could be creative.
right.  who called?
all that i'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
no, sir!
oh, right.  sorry.
okay.  run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the island.
she's dead.
oh christ! i should of been there and i wasn't there, i should've been there.
for emphasis?
her name is annie.  annie reed.
but this is different.  go on blow,
come in and see me in my office tomorrow. what's your name?
i suppose i did.
well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
i guess.
-- he's gettin' good on those eggs. and y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
her name was maggie muldovan.
you want to rent a movie.
it’s good, right?
...never... tried...
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out. i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
at the risk of sounding stuffy, jeff -- i'll remind you of the constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim. he must ask for evidence.
when i'm with you sheila, i don't even think about bowling. theo takes sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. she stops him and looks around nervously.
i'm not accepting criticism today. now don't make me lose count. there's already a half million in this portfolio.
you're looking for catherine, not me.
i didn't come for the cup of christ. i came to find my father.
oh, yes, i do, joe.  believe me. you say you're going to lose.  is it my fault?  listen!  the damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
did she believe you?
says he is the man's doctor...  you know...
yes i do. that's all i got. guts and you, johnson. there's no one else i can trust.
the dogs?
nooo!
-- what?
jim--when the lightning hit, i--i just--
i'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
go out the north exit!  there's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases.  run!
they got that kind of money?
nice try, kiddo.
i think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. what you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. i went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. he's weak, he's incompetent. he jeopardizes the whole place. there's not much more i can do for him.
you know what? it's christmas eve. and you look clean -- i mean, you're normal-looking. [resolutely, for her own benefit] it's christmas eve, and i have a couch.
we're going to have to reconfigure.
well we're pretty --
excuse me?
it isn't my army yet, colonel greene.  looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
claire...
well if i was looking for a victim, i definitely wouldn't pick your uncle phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would i ask for ransom? you??
i so wish i'd known.
it was clean.  very clean... rambo was a decorated vietnam vet, a former pow himself... if he came out and said "no pows" the sub-committee would buy it.  he gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  if he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and d.c.  airtight. but no... rambo's gotta be a hero. thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  he put me in a corner.  no choice.
what have you got there?
i'll make a note of it.  anything else?
damn.
and it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing beethoven.
i'm going to look around.
they workin' for anybody?
listen,  professor brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
and they all came...
anything in it?
we need you too!
on your desk.
yes.  price...
i didn't say...  brussels!
i'm playing to win.
fine. you know, dr. thurman isn't so bad a lady. i can tell her anything.
hey, i have an idea...
whatever... stella.
hey!  i said i'll take your fuckin' ass later.  now get out of here.  you're scaring our company.
miss johnson must be a real kindly lady.
i'm going to the store. you need anything?
thank you.
calm down, tracy.  just calm down.
sense of humour went with the memory, huh? you know why you're still here, don't you?
if it's too far, then we'll drown. but if we don’t try then we'll never know.
couldn't you have appealed to congress?
you are the blacksmith.  ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
of course you will.
i follow the wires.
you guys are being real assholes
listen to me --
i'm worried.  the vibrations could shake her to pieces.  we should have padded her feet.
yeah, heh heh. he's a anus. heh heh.
you consider your life easy.
oh, well, i'm goin' uptown, too.
cuter.
some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: the game.  you and i conor, we are different from all others around us.  you know this, you can feel it.  we are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
what?
check this out.  y'know sal's.
yes sir.
one thing at a time.  we don't even know what it is yet.
yeah, what'd you tell him?
rose is displeased. mmm... what to do?
they showed me pictures, what he did to her. evidence. said all i had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
will it help to get you out?
i'm designated driver. i have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
very accommodating well, no, sir, i'm sure ...
you're just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets?
because you said so.  maybe nobody else believed you, but i always did.
spirits have a way of bringing that out.
the mattress... the mattress... julia.
yes it is. a girlfriend maybe. but a wife? i mean...
act. here we go again. reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? what if we have some, you know... like, calling?
shut up! shut up, jack!
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
pretty sure.
natalie? natalie who?
you mean people?  i don't know.  we just cry. you know.  when it hurts.
there was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
i thought they'd talk to him. try to get him to dummy up.
he's three. why don't you wait till he's a little older?
don't worry, mr. twombley, i know where those suckers are. rain or shine, snow or no snow. i know deer. we'll kill us a buck today. guaranteed. before ten.
you don't really believe this?
bein' my partner. i'm headin' north up around the niobrara in nebraska. gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
come on, mom, you can't be serious....
you're for real?
i've always been good.  ever since i started.  gave up piano.  easy money. i'm putting a stake together, get something started.  go figure it all out...
who?
you too.
and what would that be, son?
the shit they pull, huh?
in this drawer....
you... fuck you!
your prerogative, senator.
god, fuck you!
oh.
i'm sorry about blake.
what are you doing here?
took off. yes. they took off.
i'd love to, mr. lynch, thank you.
hello ... is this the spanish consulate? this is doña ignacio fernandez.  my husband and i are leaving tonight for berlin ... is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? thank you, thank you.  how long will it take you?
you say something?
it is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. rick, laszlo must never reach america. he stays in casablanca.
tomorrow, he says.
now he's a real shit. don't get friendly with him. i'm sure he's got his hand in the till. you know what he said to me once? "i want to fuck the whole world over. that's my mission." the shit!
but, wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
what?
come on, let's check the bite radius.
get a hold of yourself!  you are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  calm down!  don't make me sorry i let you come!
huh?  oh, i'm not worrying about her - i'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
i guess i wanted to.
please.
would you two excuse me for a moment?
don't you think howard's like that? smart? important?
you should ride the pony. it is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
it doesn't mean anything.
stanzi!
anything you want.
who sent you?!  who sent you?
what is it?
she <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. was her...
i don't know. the first available flight out of germany.
what'd you say your name was?
what problems does he have, sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
where there's a will, there's a way. come on.
that's what i thought. so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
i found lisa henderson.
which one?
cause i don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
what was that?
'it's up to joe', huh?
look.  there's the order:  you wrote it:  desalvo, bianchi & buono, berkowitz and dahmer.  it's going to be dahmer next.  which means he'll kill a man.
i told you i'll get the pearls tonight.
don't go soft on me, baby.  i've got your note in my pocket.  you wrote it, all by your own self. and i have to use it.  it has to be found in exactly the right place.
pete, what happened to you?
then it's a good thing.
buddy's sister regina mary bragg got two calls from buddy up in detroit this morning, called burdon.  she's also the one gave burdon buddy's address.
good.  but "love your enemies"... body and soul.
you do?
we have to get out of here!!
us. them. i don't know ... just get going.
no, no. say it backwards, shit-wit. sra-i'm-sick say it backwards!
that wasn't my fault.
same here.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
oh jesus...!  i'll make some coffee.  they left the stove.
i'm not sure i'll last all week.  i'll tell steve.
have we met?  there's something i can't quite --
doubt is a motherfucker.
you want to lose this putz or not?!?
that money's fucked up your brain. talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
you don't know zip! you think i'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? chasing women around the store. i've got to give it a shot. why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) what the hell has changed? for two years i've done nothing but love you. i'll show you, i'm going to be just like fabian!
i know what he said.
thanks. but i just want to take a bath and...
what's to like?
he let me live. he let me be his friend.
no. no. i won't believe it. he's not dead.
and, of course, the u.n. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast.
zero distortion, sir.
did you really ask?
mobile arctic dwelling -- mad.
and two unpara-- unparalleled cir-cass-ian beauties? what is that?
you helped set up my partner, sergeant william wade.  i want to know who put you up to it.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
who cares? as long as they're keeping donovan busy. dad, you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation.
i know. he hates to have to wear uniforms.
you want to see pain?  swing by first methodist tuesday nights.  see the guys with testicular cancer.  that's pain.
how d'you do, good lady ... i am arthur, king of the britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
it's nothing ... nothing.
they're stealing my chopper!
even so, i don't think it is safe here anymore.  i've made plans to move you to a villa near siracuse. you must go right away.
atley jackson. how is that one? how's the leg... ?
'cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
if you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
d'you think you and charley'll ever get back together again?
four days.
oh, goodness!  how did you ever get like this?
it was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--gordon told us not to let jim mccord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. you just know that when gordon liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...it's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all i care about is hugh sloan. his wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. and he quit. he quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
i'm busy, man.
i know a way. i know how you can get a message out of here.
you know, everyone's so excited about the bijou re-opening...
i told you this was a sweet set-up.
and you should tell doris...
he said that father's in town. he's been seeing julia right along.
nothing. i've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. you've got one haven't you?
rowan...   think of what's in that book.  think of last night!
what a brilliant idea. i never would have thought of it.
i did not know you were so beautiful... and --
no.
she's a programmer?
right on the money!
nothin'!  aside from max's mother driving me crazy, i'm dancin' on a rainbow!  get him on the line, please.
i think it's time to get out of here.
if you had your way i wouldn't have any friends.
in a storage facility.
of course... we'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
what?
there are always slanders, always lies. you're reading the devil's lies. can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the messenger.
no beer?
i dunno. whatever will be will be...
no, i wanna kill my boss!
doesn't look good.
thanks. i thought you weren't gonna ...
nobody will swim here until next summer. by then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
i imagine so.
i haven't got that far yet.  but i don't think that everything points to wynant.  what about the alibis?
because he asked you to! he entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. he asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his katra. his living spirit.
one thing, anyway--at least penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  i bet alice threw out all my crap after i'd been gone a week.
that's right. not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother harry, and sent him to college. harry became a football star –– made second team all american.
it should be just up ahead.  hold on ... there!  there it is!
at annie's house. she's all right.
huh?
they did a nice job... cozy, huh?
they drive so recklessly there.
dance?
an innocent child is dead.
you mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
do i know you?
alright. you want some pie?
good thing you have a voice-over career.
definitely.  'you may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  in the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
twice i took the name of god in vain, once i slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once i bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
int. vitelli's helicopter - day.
thought you were dead.
would you like to rest, miette?  you must be exhausted.
i'd wash that out with some iodine...  okay, mercurochrome.
don't put yourself down like that. i <u>never</u> used you.  i worked my way up like a marine grunt!
no, just give you a splitting headache.
more light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
i gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
get away from her.
i suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
i dunno. i think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. i'm not too up on gene trivia.
too bad... thought they were harkonnen.
waitaminit, dudes! i got it! we find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. what do you think?
i promised the american people peace with honor in southeast asia.  that could take time -- two, maybe three years ... in the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
what does that mean?
yeah.  with potential.
what do you mean?
say, let's get something straight here. i don't want any part of this thing. if you've got an idea i'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! baseball's my racket, and i'm sticking to it. come on, colonel, let's get out of here.
his home number.
lord no. i'm not retired.
yes. but you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
nice guys finish last. i should know.
i begged him. don't see why he had to go...
you think i don't know that?
look, i'm just guessing...
to you?
what about the boat? we're not going on the boat?
a girl has to draw the line somewhere --
maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
hell ya. we broke that mothafucka.
what a stupid idea.
we don't....
i would, mr. doyle!  are you game?
what made you want to be a fighter?
it was probably luck- i'd rather you did the shooting.
do you... live around here?
nothing! jesus! i gotta fight with you now?
i know.  i know that.  don't spoil it.
you missed him!
if i have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
uhh... sure. and in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
the best i could do with what was in your fridge.
okay, jackie, done.  i like the way you do business.  your money is being held by a kid named larry sellers. he lives in north hollywood, on radford, near the in-and-out burger. a real fuckin' brat, but i'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  so if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
i'm not going to "do" anything, i promise.  but you need help, james. none of this is what you think it is.
i'll admit i was worried when max called. i had my doubts.
i hope you get your work done.
i got it all ready. here.
well i'm going to major in business administration and, i think, minor in communications.
what?
what are you doing here?
but i have to!
no. i only let her go with edward.  it's alright.
you did.
gee -- that fair --
look closer.  do you have anything to clean it with?
yes.  both.
seattle boys think he's guilty.  they say the evidence is rock solid.
yes.
you gotta be kidding me!  do you want me to fly up after you? over.
with all due respect, the enterprise is a disaster. there must be other ships in the quadrant.
in cluett's apartment? well dear, you see, i . . . i . . .
oh but we got to. how we gonna know our price in the future? how are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? who's gonna tell them? what are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
surprise me.
i understand why it would seem confusing. certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
what?
i have to get to the airport...
what's wrong?
if my heart's dear love--
you wouldn’t understand.
where's my father?
oh look, i haven't got time to be proper, i want to live.  i'm a woman, i like men.  if that's unladylike then i guess i'm not a lady.  at least i'm honest.
possibly, yes. that is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. that's right...
i don't think i can do this.
okay.
it's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
see me in my office.
or, it might a been under the mattress.
in the briefcase?
you think they'll find any?
i don't think i've had that pleasure.
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. you lied. it was obvious.
ok.  be careful.  and lighten up.  story of your life could be right round the corner.
in answer to your question, i suppose i endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
i won't lie -- there have been times when i had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
not when we explain about the great blessing.
there are monsters in the gelatin!
thanks much. you know what's nice about you, valerie?
get a job and probably go back to school.  figure out what i'm gonna be.
if i want to, i can go to court. a father has a right to -
where is your courage, comrade buljanoff?
we took care of that.
we're in the bronx, my man. hundred and sixty first street.
because you killed one of my crew.
i loved you so much this day. on my bed in your panties. i remember i thought, how impossibly lucky am i to have you on my bed in your panties.
where?
i ain't wearing no gun.
you shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- i don't know -- you're different.
we'll need a search running.
in the cellar, i think. wait, i'll take care of it.
he's not coming.
even tough i don't talk to her every day -- i still talk to her every day.  know what i mean?
stop it, wolfi. i look dreadful. welcome to our house, herr mozart.
three o’clock.
i'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. i'm going to make that place into something big. god, i love you!
she's wearing a ring.
so change it.
agent novak?
stay under the safety light. help is on its way.
[you're a liar. pinta's dead.]
wanna count your money?
what do you think?
same here again.
no, this is the safe sun.  it's better than a day at the beach.
you want me out...  is that what you're saying?
he moved all right!  when they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of wilson's bakery.
what about running number two by itself?
i missed you.
somethin' like that.
where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
i'm trying. i'll see you tomorrow. 
stick with me, kid.
shit!
you got any weed?
your boy.
--this can't be right.  this is going to be very embarrassing. have you ever considered--
we were working on china.
nahhh...
bruce may still refuse. it is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
not really ... but you know... maybe i'm wrong ...
can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? a lumpy mattress, that crummy tv and a crapper.
these shoes are itchy.
cleaning a rock, otis?  jot it down. as soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
i was tired and didn't have any place to go.
i'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
gotta.
ww... uh...
...not enough food?
there's a cantilevered gasket on the --
i cannot tell you.  suffice to say is one of the words the knights of ni! cannot hear!
charlie? was i dead?
sometimes you can't know what i'm doing.  it's better that way.
don't mock, claudia...
yes! hi.
you are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
are you quite finished with us?
the files are in a sealed room and the university are under strict orders to stay away.
gottingen.  that's in sweden.
i invented it, man. in my head. it's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-sunday super mutha computer.
yeah.
yeah. let's get outta here. what happened?
vietnam? i saw it on your jacket. where were you? bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
very good...
frida, this hair thing is all in your head. you're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
stop it!
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
lenny, is that you?
fellow called lime.
alright buzz, get ready...
thanks for the vote of confidence.
it's like, every day i see a beautiful woman. i'm not used to that. i'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, i don't know, once a week. i can't handle it.
hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from new york.  you're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since godzilla.
no. two times.
no...  no!
i should have been honest with you, right from the start.  i wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  i was born to murder the world.
why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
of course. in fact, i'm there right now.
hey everybody. how's it hangin'?
but i mean really... wonderfully...  great.
i'm not sad.
how the hell should i know?  come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
oh, baby, what an idea. i'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
nope. she did.  like i say.  it never panned.
oh, my. we're too late.
come on, don't me give a hard time. i'm just trying to make the place look nice for katka.
you don't even know these guys.
what were they, bootleggers?
no.  if i'm not here, you go home with thelma and kim.
it is, roy! and now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since i've been in the game.
why would anyone do something like this?
what do you look for?
c'mon, thel.  so charley had a little fling.  so what? all in all he was a pretty good husband.
equals?
how do you know what i experience?
she wasn't a nun?
yeah.
it's on the boat. he's holding a press conference tomorrow.
come on, charlie. we got business.
you have no idea.
isn't that her picture?
it's a lot more stressful than i thought.
what's this?
really?
you know there's only one man in the world for me, johnny-o.
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
wait a minute, whoa. we can't go now. what's yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
warm water, no doubt.
he's right. do you have any idea what van gogh's "vase with twelve sunflowers" is worth?
no. when you put me on the stand, i'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  and he doesn't sleep.
mister -- miss -- such politeness!
... you married?
can i ask you a question?
...have to wait.
he looks like my uncle.
shhh.
no. 
graff?  because i worked for him.
"good old shoe -- "  we put him in a sweater.
then you saw him, too?
yeah.  ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  we use the same equipment, more or less...
you know they won't do it. it's up to you. you gotta be strong.
what about the bogyman?
oh no, mr. merrick. no. no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
it's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  it would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
that's fine --
never is a long time.
i don't agree. no one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
as long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
get outta here.
yeah, as soon as we got back.
oh, darling. i'm so relieved. let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
who is this?
bourbon and milk.
why didn't you say something?
i know.
hold on a second.
what about the other agents?  ella? tee?
what a tragedy.  it was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
read it yourself.
they're all crude, when they don't work. had breakfast?
no, but i told him i'd be at the town tavern next saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
precisely. and then it came to me. my greatest ever plan. i made a deal with some minor league bad boys. arms dealers, renegades generals, you know the type. with you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
hold me tighter.
fascinating. listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. there's a place on the hill i always get trip to take me.
no.
look, we just got this bucket going again.  i'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
money?
oh sure it is.
i know. well, alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that i'm going through a phase, that's all.
he did?
aw, forget it.
no!
don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
er, yeah, sure, i'll have 'em.
turn around?
yeah, i heard, yeah.
just a manner of speaking.
you're not going to notify my father, are you?
well no, but... jeanne, are you happy at home?
he's tampered with it, dowser.
it was *i* who rose in this chamber to accuse him. he is saying that i was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
not yet, mister worf.
whoever dusted leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the badlands. jimmy looks twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. it's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. his parents were killed in a car wreck.
chew? toby chew? no.
what are you getting at?
when do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
okay.  i love you too.
...i figured...i figured you'd turn back.
it's very monotonous.
well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
trust leonardo....
it isn't important.
and what's that mean?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
steady. continue on impulse power.
you want'a surf, soldier?
that's really sweet, ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
in bad weather, yeah.  mostly i camp out in the woods.  i thought maybe you were down on your luck too when i picked you up.
i can't see...
how high up, which republicans?
grace, i can't.  i can't even get out of here myself.  i need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
i'm sorry, newt.
of course you did. i said a great flyer, not a smart one. you fly reckless. great instincts. no discipline. that ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. of course you got killed...and well deserved to. it was a really stupid mistake. in battle, it gets people killed.
i'm not.  just a little poach job.
in case i need it?
is that your porty or mine?
is that why you brought him? because of me.
um, yes.  i haven't fought with them, since i started here.
yeah.
who are you? hitler's hall monitor?
oh.
yes.
yes, very strange.
go where?
we were all upset about that.
a user?
you have done it?
no thanks. i'm good.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
'it's up to joe'?
yeah, casey and steve were completely hollowed out. takes a man to do something like that.
a matter of hours now.
oh, are we late? there are no clocks in this town.
i don't want him caring about his wife! what about the vice president!
well...
i got your message. way to go!
we're inside the white house now.
who are you talking to?
under the circumstances, you may call me mrs. peel.
that's big of you, bob.
ronnie...
i can't tell you.
know what i'm going to buy with my first pay check?
but i want to say with you,
did he ask you to take your clothes off?
oh.
what am i scared of?
you've asked me that one three times.
preliminary hearing at superior courthouse?
i'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  i believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
really?
ye...
hi, sweet stuff.  good news.
thank you.
anything?
wai...it's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  what did you say...?
hah!  yeah, oz, i bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
i visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes i've been seeing in newsweek.
you don't think he's mixed up in -
pretty fast, wasn't it.  the way they let him go.
uh yes, thank you.  it was quite enjoyable.
give me a readout, dejesus.
with mama, putting the baby to sleep.  francesca's very happy. michael was kind to her.  she idolizes him.  the children are all out in the speedboat.  i'm going to my house.
sounds wonderful.
no.
you killed my husband.
yes, that's what happened.
elaine -- that is not what happened.
we? you and your parents killed your husband?
went --
tell me you recognize me, arnie.  please...
and then killing your sister.
excuse me.
actually, i'm fine.  i'm great. last night i got to thinking, "you know what?  maybe it is time to move on.  maybe we're just not right for each other.  or maybe we are.  but time will tell and at this point i'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." you know?
guests.
deb, i want to throw you a shower.
you mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
maybe.
bela, somebody misplaced the motor. so when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
you're damn right i do.  five years down here and i'll pull in more than 15 topside.  i'm not down here for the fun, i'll tell you that.
i don't believe it, jean – they're picking straws.
what?
my pleasure.
you'll be gone, period.
what are you talking about? we went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
how could anybody behave like that?
yet your still here ... i gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
yeah.
yeah. hi. thank you for seeing me.
yes.
i unnerstand. i'll keep it real short, then. i'm on my way out of town, but i was just - do you mind if i sit down? i'm carrying a bit of a load here.
what scheme?  your scheme, you bloody little genius.
if we married, we'd shut him out forever.
what the hell are you talking about?
fine!
and professionally?
yes. but i got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
who knows? if dr. darling is right, you should watch out.
you're joking.
i'd lie on my cot in the cell and i couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. and i'd say to myself, think of something nice. something beautiful. and then i'd think of you. and my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
that's great dad.
i promise you in time, she'll become your home ...if i could offer you one piece of advice?
i want that brain.
do it my way.
can i use some?
where do our records go to in the castle?
tank, i need a pilot program for a military m-109 helicopter.
marcus, you honor me, but i'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
yeah, i suppose... dad, who's harry york?
evildoers, huh?  big or small?
well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
you don't know she's a bitch.
i got home fine. how's the "warehouse."
sir, planet core readings unstable... changing rapidly...
it's obvious what you have to do. your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the suez canal...
if he talks to me, i think he'll leave you. do you want him to leave you?
hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. you don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
which you don't have.
back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
does that mean i'm back for awhile?
thanks.
the gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of hy-brasil will sink beneath the waves.
who won? how did it end?
actually, i was married.  for four years.  but... well, we didn't fit together.  i'm divorced now.
carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise's proper evolvement.

we'll get you out in ten minutes.
orthopedics?
she'll be here next weekend.  why don't you come too, james?  i'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  if you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia.
i don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
we gonna hit 'em wid da bomb dickey on dis' one.  what's the setting?
yes, please continue.
... let's take a look over there.
so. where are we sitting?
did you know when i was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
he's so cute. i even like his cute little penis. it's like a little pig's penis or something.  rose, we connect on every level. i've finally found someone i can feel completely safe with.
mr. lime - yes.
okay -- no limo.
no. i want to draw.
you had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games.
may i ask you a personal question?
gotta go, man.
what is that old building?
it's my job to keep my job.  and that, by the way, is now head of praetorian guard.  good ole tribuus has been retired.
well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  radar gives me noise. sonar gives me noise.  infrared -- noise.  let's try ultraviolet.  there. flat.  it's totally flat.  a plain.

tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  kids.  kids. kids!  i love them.
sorry i got you up, boy. go back to sleep. yeah, be glad to.  said to give you his regards.
i think that's a good idea.
thank you. now the negro in the field caught hell all day long. he was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. if the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. if the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. and if you said to him, "let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "yeah, man, any place is better than this." you've got a lot of field negroes in america today. i'm one.
come where?
you know, tom, i feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  maybe you should feel that way.
commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
what we missed in the eeg and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. at the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
there is no --
yep.
'if?'  my, my, my...the five hundred people on bruny island that you deliberately infected with <i>chimera</i> needed it as well.
we don't have to kill him.  just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  it was your idea, remember?  i'm doing this for you.  i'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
i will see what i can do.
no, of course, you want to get out of town.
wrong, dad. your idea.
i won't, earl. 
how the hell are we gonna get outta here?
departure angle.
nothing.
i'll say there is!
yeah.  can some of you guys help me?
because i don't have time.
i didn't mean to...
you?
what does that mean?
you're getting warmer!
you're right -- i am a coward.
get some sleep.  and tell sean i'm sorry.
that isn't necessary.
couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
polish?
i told them.
you think i haven't been trying!  it's like there was never anything there.  just water.
oh! you're supposed to fasten it!
sure.
no, but... why do you ask that?
i ain't really thought about it too much i don't reckon.
meade has 18 underground acres of computers. they scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "president". we red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. when the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
what are we looking for?
we can't begin this way. let me turn on the light.
sidney's father?
thanks, professor.
the gentleman has nothing contraband.
a mental case?
a drink? of course.
til thursday, my darling, i shall count the minutes.
you know what, nevermind.  you're not ready.
why?
just...want to be ready when we do.
...browsing.
you're nick's mother?
but ya got a boss.
i'm sure picking up on vices.
shut up, grady.
where's dylan?!  have you seen him?
so... oh, how i wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. what size shoe do you wear? size 9. that's a very lovely size. but i'm sorry, i wear size 8.
christoph had spinal cancer.  his body kept rejecting gene therapy. he was desperate.  it was him, it wasn't us --
it’s because i’m shy, betty.  so, when are you going to leave that old corpse mr. peterson and run away with me?
that's right.
sergeant?
no?
what did you hear ?
what are you doing? you can’t. i...
you guys are thrashed.
you, an imaginary friend.  that's what she calls her.
it's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
jimmy grantz. know him?
you've got a lot of nerve.
recite the lord's prayer.
then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
growls a reserved greeting.
i just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
give it.
yes, thomas, that is correct. then he stopped visiting my garden.
they used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
mr. gazzo wants the two hundred now!

it's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
got a lot of homework?
there should be some kind of manual release...
yes.
it gets worse there. leavin' me to my own mind. that's just not good.
i did. i walked out the door. i felt like i was a scared little kid. i thought you knew that about me. i ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. you said, "so go" with such disdain.
what?
they don't have to.
i understand your concern, but i feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  look at yourself.
you have a map.
why?
can't you let me enjoy the moment?
that's because your union bosses <u>are</u> those guido mother-fuckers.
i'm not crazy.  i'm inept.
the minute we get a job, i'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
you two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. we're there for those stones, period. since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. we're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. what if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
what's with her? if they're not bleeding they're pmsing. if they're not pmsing, they're warning you about the impending doom. if you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
totally.
he'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
no.
it seems highly intelligent to me.
mr. scruggs, jeff wigand. lowell bergman said i should give you a call...
31 people.
i drink.
since when?  usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
burgel, i thought it would be easier, as long as i was passing --
we was by the river? and i hear my friend callin' for help, and i look and she has falling in the water--
we played down in jackson yesterday. heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. it's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
i'm only asking questions.
i just want to get it over with.  my mom's making me do this. i just want to forget it.
someone jumped on your car with their butt...
you can't keep being his father...
so?
what's your name, boy?
mary -- how do you feel?
i know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. like us.
what?
oh, but they can!
tonight?
five years. since it opened.
all right, judge.
chancellor.
no. but i fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the hutu militia and the tutsi rebels.
probably tonight.
how do i know i can trust you?
but there are eighteen patients on the ward, mister mcmurphy.
-- no one could.  no one lives any nearer than town.  no one will come any nearer than that.  in the night.  in the dark.
i'm on my way.
what do you want, hun?
i want to -- what else can i do with my money?  you may not see me again -- for a while.
-- kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
have you always lived here?
why not?
relax!
nope.
all right, he's on final now! put out all runway lights except niner.
thank you.
get it.  from outside, if you have to.
blair.  he's gone berserk.
as you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
excuse me.
i did.  that stuff i gave him was counterfeit.  they'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
and i got mine, meaning you.  nice how that works out.  i'm serious this time, i'm closing this place down.
who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called branded, dude?
is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
guards come exactly every three minutes....
oh, and austin...
we're gonna scare him?!
do you still talk to sylvan?
drafted by the red sox.
no, it - it - nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did i tell you? i mean, you asked me, and i knew you were going to come out no matter what i said, but what did i tell you? do you remember what i told...
it's not your <u>fault</u>!!
isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
excellent!
what shade of powder do you use?
you mean, "consuela" is a good mother..
after we corroborate it. that's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  anything else?
we have to transport mr. israel to las vegas, time is of the essence. the gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at tahoe international. i'm sorry, i'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. return to washington. you'll be debriefed in the coming days.
yes.
good idea!
operations building.  far end of the street.
yeah...
they're none of them right.
oh, dear god...
other people?
go to hell.
pullin' ah pants down...
you. mouth closed.
gentlemen, i am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the manchester cotton company has been successfully negotiated.
yeah. that was me.
scottie, please...!
gregoire, what are you doing here?
you never asked them about it?
i call him the boy with the ice cream face!
ohhh. that's new. that sounds good.
i think maybe you'd better. and connell—i'd like to have the john doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter miss mitchell wrote, for which i gave her a thousand dollars.
you sound disappointed.
no.
can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
one hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
i need to repair my turbo boosters. do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
yes, sir.
i'll try not to remember to warn evelyn.
no, i don't think about fucking my family. that's sick!
no.  but it's somewhere without big worms.
because you're... different.
we'll see you next week, and if--
come on. haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
fuck do you want?
nope.
mercutio! thou art consortest with romeo?
my gosh, alvin, was i supposed to object every time you did that?
no.  hi baby.
the witch's voice.
he was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. a scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
glad to hear it.  tell poor mr larson to come through, will you?
talk to him. you speak shellfish!  hey, look... put it in the pot.
i don't have much time. 
don't "sir" me-- you have no idea who you're dealing with.
he's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
don't you believe it. later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  you go to your world, i’ll stay in mine. so long, mister.
i'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. i'm tired of people saying babe brother this, babe brother that. what's my name?
what else?
i'm from belgium.
this time you're really going?  you know where i'll be.
i've got to get that.  relax.  i'll see you tomorrow.
i don't care.  as long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
that's the first time marty ever brought a girl to this house. she seems like a nice girl. i think he has a feeling for this girl. you heard him sing. he been singing like that all morning.
i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. we've just received word that dr. evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
we're liable to win if we keep this up. for somebody like you, you sure run fast.
like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
but i thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how i come across?
it was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  i knew that was too much.
i'm busy.
it's my birthday.
i'm telling you it's not that.
i threw it away.
i got a kid, you know.  i'm a person, for chrissake.
you own this place?
i must have miscalculated. how. . .
okay.
what's going on?
not at all.
our little baby's growing up...
not what.  who.
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. maverick well, get used to it.
if they've looked at the video.
thank you, i work at it...
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- i mean really naked --
-- that's the fact, bud --
that never would of --
oh that's okay, i hardly even--
i'm not supposed to tell. not until you've counted too. we're each supposed to make an independent count.
so you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  everybody likes me!
she jumped.  she'd been depressed.
what?
oh shit.  you said "boss."
she's the best damn witness we have!
shhhhhhhh!
then perhaps i believe in evil after all.
darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. people are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. if you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? if your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
and we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
she's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
most places are, jimmy.
okay. soon? do you think i'm too fat?
hockey player? he's not a ...
giovanni, i want to thank you.
when i count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
careful of that edging there...
never heard of him, who is he?
because god loves a winner.
you... you think i saved your... life.  i can't take advantage....
about a year.
what do you want me to do?
because i loved jacqueline i thought i knew her. today i found out such strange things ——frightening things. i saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— i feel as if i'd never known her.
that's got to our secret agent man! do we have an address?
second.
jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
yes, father?! yes?
as a matter of fact--i am home.
for certain, no.
hey, wait a minute. when am i going to see you again?
i can handle that.
i'm not sure. but i think they're worried about you.
well, it seems to me...
somethin' i forgot to do. i'll be back.
shit, doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
ah yes.  farley flavors.  you know, i find it...
no. why?
what else?
with a sitter.  we have a sensational sitter.  jonah's really comfortable with her.  you know, a second mom sort of. like part of the family.  amazing with kids.
...i had a dream about...something like that.
what's the chances of mantan being picked up?
no.  look, it's me okay?  can't it just be about me?  for once?
john...
thanks for clearing that up.  i hear your former girlfriend is going out with greg barnett.
yeah. grab one of the cards behind you. call that number. it's my cell.
then he drove me home.  he tried to put himself away as legit, so i went right into the pitch.
i'll take care of you.
are you relieved?
he'll try to finish his experiment.
i'm here, smith, how's the clark?
mm hmm.
where are you?
oh, and austin...
nothing. i'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. i mean let's go see. let's go see if they do or not.
what?
i play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
uh-huh.  i've heard about the rockfall, ray. i think you've been spending too much time with spengler.
as they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
hey! fuckin' a! just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
ray. look at me.
oh, god... kyle.  i need you so much.
hey, she came to talk...
or else what?
tsk.  excuse me, i didn't think he had change for a hundred.
i know where dwight works.
ewwww!  thank you, rosemary.
what about joe?
huh huh. you guys are funny. let's have a drink on it.
most natural thing in the world!
kramer--
bad fuckin' news.  even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  but he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  it'd cap it for garber if he could bring him in.
what signal?
that happens to be the truth.
he's in the living room asleep.
any bit in particular?
corridor a.
sh, sh! fuck you!
if that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
ooh yes. i think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
can i see you again?
good morning.
yes sir. it will be the best of your collection, i assure you.
only five, sir. we've checked them all. he hasn't used any of them.
you shouldn't have bothered. i really don't have that much of an appetite.
for the first time today, superman i must tell you that you're wrong.  but how could you know that -  oh, well. i guess i could tell you now. y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
harvard?
yeah, your fee. i had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
yea, art thou there?!
i have a very low resistance.
you're not working at random house, i talked to them.
it's awright, tommy. i wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. i can't read no fault in you.
yeah.  clay.  i met him sometime in june of '62 at the masquerade bar. dave ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
no thanks.
no. like i say, he was funny-looking. more'n most people even.
where's the dough?
well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's anna -- and then she said, call me at the ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
so what is they have enough to shut us down!
any books you like to read for fun?
because i already tried once.
hey, sweetheart. what you up to?
no sir, not at all. it's just that i'm going to open my own business and...
fuckin' a! we got a five hour drive back to la ahead of us. <b> ext. macdonald's -- parking lot -- moments later </b> choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back parking lot of the macdonald's. alf is hosing him down. domino stares at choco... admiring his body.
yeah! them.
uh oh...
yeah, down the end.
what??
just about anything, walter.
why didn't you?  you knew she was keeping her home from school. you knew she was an alcoholic.
we are...  "south of the border down mexico way."
here we go!
we can't delay the archaeological expedition to hanoran two. it would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
i can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. that's when the girl found him.  something smells like shoe polish.
no.
what does this have to do with me?
no. they never figured it out. i did. most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. not without hurting them.
don't believe it. i'm just skin deep.
i. yes. it is.
we'll discuss sexism in survival situations when i get back.  you just take me through this step by step.  i'm on channel two.
i'm still better than you. nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
yes -- we do.
the others decided to get cute with me, so i'm teaching them a lesson!
some job.  card filing and cabinet dusting.  four years in this dump and i haven't written anything for wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
did you get starside r&d ?
where are you?  are you there?
why don't you read it to her? it worked for nuwanda.
you mean babies with you?
yes.
so inhale!
that ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
i don't think you're gonna need it.
you don't have any money, do you? just in case there's silk.
it was. what sadness lengthens romeo's hours?"
buy some.
nobody can make that shot and you know it. not even a lucky lush.
it's getting dark. go home.
want me to get that?
can i walk you home?
the most. you ever lost. on a coin toss.
they said because the detectives were working for the department of the interior --
a little petting is not the issue!
what do you see?
nah.  it's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
if you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
yeah...
you think you could make an exception just this once, boss? she came all the way down from new york.
what?
you've suckered me before, darling, remember? why should i believe you now?
course i like him, i like pizzas to but i'm not gonna marry one.
i don't know.
it was the poorest lemon ranch in california, i can assure you.  my father sold it before they found oil on it.
i'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
well, technically i did what ya said.
you're not allowed to lie.
it's what?
well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  it's cold out here, susie.
fine.
first i need a copy of the key.
it was there.  this angry music all by itself.  and i heard whispering.
how'd you get the picture?
the coca is my responsibility!
don't touch me! i'm not doing it for you!
correct me if i'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
i've been taking pictures so long i don't know how to read anymore.
is what the money thing?
you liked what i brung ya?
i joined up for her. i wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. i'm a fool.
you're very direct, mr. felson.
cameron?
well, i thought he'd come in the middle.
chris.  you come to collect something, chris? should i have something for you?
thank god for that!
i won't let you have it.
but i love you.
yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
i'm sorry i didn't mean to break your concentration.  i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
yes. i've -- i've met some very remarkable people in india... and -- and when i read what you've been doing here, i -- i wanted to help.  does that surprise you?
sure. i love venice.
no! you will stand there and you will listen! what happened to you, bill? you were the one who joined up to do good in the world. you were the one who believed in it --
my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands.
she's all yours. put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
too many. and you've got a new guest. a movie star from hollywood.
can't you make it later?
"today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  by your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
haven hamilton is your father? can you arrange an interview?
well, i did, didn't i? you didn't go through with it, did you?
is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
i know i won't be your puppet.
well, that sounds fine to me.
brad. please don't tell mom and dad...
it's a white powder that comes in a vial.
you have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
it's lonely in there, in my room.
about 250 million of your miles.
no, sir!  i just want to do my part. to get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  and i have the experience, i know who the people are...
yes.
at least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
sure, ma.
i can get another one going. y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
now phyllis, if you don't invite me, i'm coming anyway.
i told him.
but who was the devil?
through the ass.
and now that your mother's dead?
yeah, but i hear she gives a mean blow job.
how did you get in here? you're under age.
this side.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
the flowers... they're beautiful.
that's spectacularly unfair.
mobile hq. in a blue funk.  can't take chances. i'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
...givem what they want...but...
okay.
what if she says something important?
there's nothing to talk about.
you're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
i don't feel like going to work today.
dear boys. playing it cool. wish you were here. love, cool hand luke.
sometimes right when you're looking at them.
i want to be the way i was before.
what are you talking about?  it’s me, jack campbell.  penthouse c. i put you into commercial paper!
jack... green jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
when hedda says "i'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
connie...
in there.
to do what?
hi, dad.
deuce perkins.  mickey c's narcotics lieutenant.  the night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of mickey's heroin went missing.
so your memory's coming back?
yes.
should i?
i don't know. are you in, anthony?
deathly afraid of it. her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
you have a card in here?
no one knows you're here?
please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
not any more... now i like chocolate.
what's she like?
tom, daddy would like to see you in the garden.  and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee. and remember to say 'please'.
but?... but? there is a "but," nathan.
not while you're driving.
well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? like audrey hepburn.
who?
who are they?
so you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? a-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
something's wrong.
i can't leave the house?
i'm not going anywhere.
i'm not -- i didn't -- al, you know how i feel about you...
your superiors are two days away!
look around, sis!  <u>she's not here</u>.  so you can stop talking to me like i'm your little boy --
what's that supposed to mean?
you're too hard on him.  he is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
created?
go ahead.
i see.
ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
on what?
all right, forget it.  tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
oh!
i want it.
<u>what</u>?...
you've seen enough.
i know.
where does he go?
if not you, then who?
all the time.  it's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
let him come to the wedding.  you're not running, right?  say it. "i'm not..."
why didn't you say so?
guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. just then there's this fuckin' boom like fifty yards down the road. some guy's car hit a tree.
it's true!
oh, my god!
ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  we can all agree to disagree without making threats.
she said that?
ooooooohh. now we're getting somewhere.
what?
dad...
point of fact, weren't tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
he didn't either.
i did?
a jerk.
mine!  mine!  or i'll help you not.
it's a good idea for a newspaper.  four hundred sixy thousand.
yes?
they were all veterans.
yeah?
i thought so, too.
what do you want?
by killing them?
no.
she fucked us both.
oh god... oh god... santos... oh god marietta... are you in on this?... oh god!!!
that's great, harry. so what's the --
i was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
either do you.
annie -- there's nothing between mitch and me.
that's you.
hey...
i was down in adamant...
you liar!
don't burn that gorgeous body, or i'll scratch your eyes out...
i appreciate your honesty, george.
you can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
i haven't looked at myself yet. i figured i could tell from your reaction.
it's a sign.
so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. and, krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
just serve.
i mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- i've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
i know that.
you two better quit it.
i have no interest in your body, mr. boone.  i can assure you of that.
describe mallory.
you only embarrass yourself.
they won't get a conviction. the husband called it in as a suicide. the forensic guys weren't thinking murder. i'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
attitude?  me?  i think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  we're in this together. don't back out on me now!
my cheering section.
then we must go there too.  to rule. finally - to rule!  and then you shall have what you want.
-- standard.
stan... i think you and i need some time apart.
tseirp a si eh! eno on ma i! eno on ma i! ahhhhhhhhhhh!
yeah.  well -- no.  she's kind of playing hard to get.  as a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  so, what's on the schedule?  a brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
they have...  but we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. we can only keep things miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
that's all going to change, yori...
we are not forgettin' webb's promise!
the tv didn't work.
it was implanted by the agency.
yeah? you sure?
was it a nice funeral?
i feel your pain, but i cannot betray her.
i won't try to keep up with you. i'm not as fast on my feet as i once was.
no problemo.
oh, you gonna make me say it.
they're just cops.  stall them as long as you can.
nothing. i'm just saying--i might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and i'd still tear into a guy i saw kicking a dog. not that *he* is, by a long shot--
i felt like it, so what? goddam, you and ann make such a big deal out of it.
too late.  why are you here? did you cone... up here for a reading?
michael, why must you do this.  we have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  it is from love for your father that i've asked you never to more than an hour from the villa.
oh, my darling.  i'm sorry, too.  i won't do that again -- whatever you do.  i won't cause you any more embarrassment, i promise.
do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish?
it's <u>garlic</u>!!  i like garlic, but...
that's okay.  you seem pissed off all the time, though.
nothing at all?  now?  last month? anything in the last few years?
i'll see yuh.
a shift change should come through the scheduling office.
and the one driving the other car?
it's a gift to my people -- and i see macfarlane and gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and i would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
i've been swimming, merv.
he's kidnapping me!!!
there are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank god there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. we've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
enough though, eh?
alderman.
no.  she'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
data's positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise. command codes, security protocols...
it might have been more.  might have been positively grand talk.
is miss dugan well?
i know. simultaneously, they shake and zip. claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
lay on, macduff.
i can't help the traffic.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
we concur, saavik. and saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. i'm getting nervous...
it makes a great deal of difference. that's fraud.  if they found out, you could go to prison.
not at all.
it violates so many trusts.
when i came back, i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman.
what are you saying?
it seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
i know a guy.
come on, bargain with me.
number five with a bullet.
ever see her with someone else?
i think we should go straight. i mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
i didn't.
nor i, on the second.
that's what everyone thinks.  but according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
go ahead! spin it around the block. now i know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
there's fun, bro.  then there's fun.
oh, it's so nice to meet you.
uh, huh?
you mean spies and things like that?
but the machine worked -- that's what i've been trying to tell everyone!  the tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
don't get kinky here...
you better.
i trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, mister?
the venom of bad memories.  you were there; you saw her.  i saw you seeing her.
i don't believe you, rebel. where are your headquarters? on the mainland?
he's dead. cap'n's dead. christ, i was looking right at him when --
i'm not a doorman, miss barrett.  i'm a building superintendent.
comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. in a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  people like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. i guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  you're always chasing after something. at least you think you are. truth is, you're just running away.  from yourself, mostly. 'cause you're miserable. you hate yourself. the world's full of people like you. don't know what they want.
well, jeff put that out himself.
phreak and joey are being framed. we need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
i poisoned him.
goodbye.
this is treason!!  what a fool i was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
that's very nice of you. thank you.
the <u>ghoul's wife</u>?!  god, i can't believe i'm doing this...
yes.
and <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal homecoming...?
i've just come to tell you how fabulous i am.
not one word. he admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
cuervo jones has more firepower than two armies. no one gets near him.
damage control!  what kind of damage? what's going on barnes!
right now it's on the balcony.
well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
you know your father enjoys his company.
no way, man.
i did not call her mad.  i merely asked her if she was.  and i repeat the question.  are you mad?
i made miss - miss alexander send you the note.  she was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
no, it wasn't, it was intentional.
how?
listen, detective, i wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
i'm not the first lady, anymore.  i shouldn't be here.
well, what time is it?
yeah, nine years straight.
how do you know who's real and who's not?
we're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
you're color blind.
stooly.
aw, don't get mushy.
"life can be beautiful." hey, i know where it was.
you don't understand. it's an addiction. you fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. but the pain's back in the morning. and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  i want better for you.
i can make it.
i can dig that. bittersweet perfection. dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
listen you stupid fuck, i want my car.
cassius, didn't i tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
now you'll be mine, cindy.
well, are you sure about this baby thing? it's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
there's kind of this guy i'm seeing.
norther, do you ever regret not making it to paris?
new york is dangerous place.
i won't wait -- i can't wait -- i waited three days before i got a room at all and what a room that is.
i want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
how do you know they're not?
you mean you never seen a jack daniels on the rocks before?
no. [beat] you put me on drugs and then you put me in the jacket.
i'm going back to the institute.
yes.
truman, i think i'm going to throw up.
it's all taken care of. it's down on our bill.
i'm scared, grady.  i know it sounds crazy.  but, there's something trying to get into my body.
i guess you're just habitual.
i...
he's fucking nuts.
how about trying your fine italian hand?
but... but wait a minute. we're supposed to be different, right? clifford says... this theatre is supposed to be different! and this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
he loves you very much.  he just--
yeah.  i guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
 no, that's not possible, mason.  the trout... 
nothing is more important.
okay, just calm down. it's going to be okay.
we were talking one time, drinking rum.  i may've mentioned adele, how she worked for a magician.  chino got interested.  he's like, yeah?  how does he saw the woman in half?  he wanted to meet her.  or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
your house must have been a zoo.
something awful happened last night.
fuck you! fuck all of you! i'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- and drinking moonshine with johnny cash! senior and junior!
you've never said anything about voodoo before, mrs. rand.
disco ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
they tend to follow moving things. maybe it's following polo and timmy.
you saw me standing alone ...
well be more careful, please.
up one kilometer, jay.
not for long.
and you love life?
wouldn't make any difference.
no. it's not don.
i've been trailing the cashier like you told me. you're right about that guy, chief. there's something screwy somewhere.
the usual grind.
daddy, what's the matter?
i have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! and what are you puttin' up? you're puttin' up words!
before i ask you to be honest with me, perhaps i should be completely honest with you--
thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
you do and i'll fire you.
microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  that's what?
it smells like shit in here?
you're too young.  sorry.
i'm sure i can come up with something.
i'm worried about someone.
well, sir, like i said, for the same reasons we do.  i mean, all the experts say the most likely way for war to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
justin?
let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. you do it again, nobody, not rhonda, not yolanda, gonna save your ass.
i used to tell myself. talent is more erotic when it's wasted. will i see you tonight?
okay. i want you to call jennifer and i want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and i'm gonna listen in on the other line.
you want something to drink?
not a coke or anything?
it's true, dignan.
warm them up.
you'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
mr. kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
fi' cents! they pain' you fi' cents?
three thousand miles?... how many times does twenty go into three thousand?
of course it is. do you know what the sun is? why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. a bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
fuck you! fuck you!
simon, why has he become so... so...
this is it! the time for action is now!!  <b>something must be done! this is like a spreading rash! they're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! can't you see what this is leading to? a world of smut and sex and poo! i believe the good fight has begun! something must be done!</b>
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality.
is anybody besides you here now?
do it then.
if it didn't happen in louisville, it'd happened someplace else. if it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. that's the kinda dame she was.
what year is it?
sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. it makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  just like beauregard.  one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
i just wanted... i don't know... after all that... i just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, john." and mean it.  that's all.  after all that.
just use common sense. your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best cross action.
domino. do you have a last name... domino?
mr. rose, i'm in the *doctor* business.  if you want, i can help you. you don't have to go anywhere.
damn if i won't.
funny guy.
grandpa. my father. it's his.
you're sick. you should go to the nurse. i'm going to tell miss dennis.
i don't know.
you like her?
mmmm.
why?
madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of elora danan like your own daughter.  she is all that matters.  are you going to abandon her?
i don't think so.  no one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- i mean unless they're...
i have to think! i have to think!
i come from a big family.
hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  dinosaurs had their shot.  nature selected them for extinction.
well, no. you agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. the station entered into this on that understanding. if you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. you can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. it's not fair to us. more importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. they're interested in you. they've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
it is, and i'm gunning just the same way for your major callaghan.
i feel guilty. i feel like i pushed him away. i spoke and he heard you.
for a good reason.
and wear a crown and everything.
it's flooding like a son of the bitch.
why?
sounds like a stall to me.
is very angry.
if you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
i have an urgent commpic from space lab regula i for the admiral. dr. carol marcus.
quit stalling -- i want to see some identification -- now!
probably.  sarah, if i get zeroed...
place all alone like that?  must be a boarder check point.
i don't like the noise.  just practice.  practice makes perfect.
yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
mmm, not really. but you're gonna love this one.
you stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- i don't know --  but i can't stay here.  <u>i can't</u>.
no!
some other time, cecile.
sure, mike.  i'll go along.
i didn't do if for you, anyway. i just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
he's lying.  hauser turned against you.
what's that -- what's that?
i understand.
...maybe...
yes?
the point is to not call attention to ourselves.
loretta.
don't ask me those questions dear, i'm not the patient.
be quiet!
what?
oh, god!
no. i never date outside my race.
get up from there. i don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. get up from there!
that was grammoo's. it's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. come here, i'll diagnose your head.
dude's a half--squid. ain't many places he can hide. sea world, maybe.
just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
i have to talk to you..
good.  it's terrible.
maybe. but there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
that's why i'm here.  i need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, farrell.
it doesn't matter.  it's too late for all of us.
sorry.
don't do it.
he left here about an hour ago and went down to dude finlay's joint.
sure, claire. if you don't mind walking my way.
i don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
yes.
yes!
good point.
connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
this isn't an animal, vince.  i've been on this case four months, remember?  i've learned a few things.
you gimme this bullshit psychic friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
strange you didn't hear it. omit 274f
well ... if he's your grandfather, who knows?
wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
we're seeing all the signs in town.
kelly van ryan...
there's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. you ever hear that one?
everything i say is wrong. i can't talk to her anymore.
what do you mean you can see?
you didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
i've really got to --
which part of the room is mine?
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
glad to meet you, jill, mr. pope.
jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  if you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
i'm in the bathroom.
oh, shut up. you’re an optician.
of course, he's only here two days a week. he's also on staff over at loma vista.
why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
i'll take it... until i get killed or you find someone better.
yeah, fuck 'em.  no offense.
you'll answer my questions?
charlie?
yes. 
i... i... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called babbitt's...
if you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
don't tell me.  another vision of incomparable beauty?
okay.
that's all right, that's all right...
i don't. but i got confidence in findley.
tomorrow. see you tomorrow night.
i guess it's getting serious.
how many?
look, i'm a very nervous man.  i gotta have a job where i come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  and twice a year i gotta have a six month vacation.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  jesus, alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
mathesar, i need you to prepare pods for my crew.
life is confusing, isn't it?
very impressive.
just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
oh i love to cook. i guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but i believe you should trust your instincts. when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... i don't know... harmless. ready for ice cream?
the whole thing – painting.
it happens to be how i feel.
half the pilots down here fly drugs ...he's always going off....
no problem.
what for?
a lot of things fell apart up there.
no, we just ate. i only remember how tough my father was. now i know he had to be like that, to make us tough. this city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
okay. i gotta tell you. i've. discovered some things. .anyway i have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. the first picture is this.
very well.  that means that you have met all mr. holland's requirements.  now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
how far?
looks like a rope.
but it's absurd.
'yes' is the answer to your question.
then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
mood swing. i'm manic depressive.
hello, alan.
someone bet me a dollar ..
see, that's the problem with terrorists.  they're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
let's get you inside . . . .
sorry.

look, jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. comes september, the picnic is over -- goodbye. the kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  they don't make these shrimp like they used to.

i'm home from school. my father's in the hospital.
i understand.
rug-peers did not do this.  i mean look at it.  young trophy wife. marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  she owes money all over town--
okay, everett.
after all that i've done for that fuck! and he wants to be with that slut? fine! he can have his slut!
the white power structure wants us to act like savages.  but we're a different kind of animal altogether. we're panthers. and the black panther party for self defense is very painfully aware that america has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. so we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! and effect revolution. we revolve the power into the hands of the people. where it belongs.  power to the people baby...
i can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. she's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on santa claus and the other dummies. i've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
to hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  it's un-american.  i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
you're crazy. the camera loves you, vanessa.
even by you?
pull up at the drugstore, will you, max.  i'll get you some.
how are you, travis? i read about you in the papers.

can't sit all day on that sofa. need to get your legs strong.
heaven on earth?  master, i don't understand.  a temple, where heaven is on earth?  a mountain, where earth reaches for the --
this place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
i said no.
two weeks from tomorrow.
don't lie to me, motherfucker. you apparently think i'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! don't you? say: clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. say it!
won't it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
i copy.
it's the paymaster from moscow -- with our gold.
don't thank me. you're doing all the work.
bad news from america.  your brother, santino.  he has been killed.
mr. fitts, with all due respect, i think lawson needs the bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. and i think lawson deserves the bijou.  there's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
no, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. it's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
what about you, delmar? what're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
obeah evil.  i not evil.
yes, i'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. what do you think is out there?
you work alone, savvy? you can't handle the job, i'll find someone who can.
what business?

i was doing my job.
how much time do you have?
you heard the lieutenant ! on the bounce, troopers !
what have you got to do with it?
yeah, and you were--
i'm gonna call her.
i think you gave me too much time, captain.
i thought for sure they would catch me.
paul, we're not trying to blame miss connell.  it isn't a question of blame.  it's a question of what we are to do with jessica.  the commissioner is very concerned.
better than you.
you have to be kidding.
i think you falsely identified him. yes.
fernet and tonic.
blake?
yes, you may... but don't make any noise.

anyone want to go the lighthouse?
i'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
but what?
right.
does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
that's right.  clips.  look, i want you to know what we're talking about here.  this isn't like tv only better.  this is life.  it's a piece of somebody's life.  pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  you're there. you're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
all right.  i'll do it.  i'll do it.
why?
the west end.  we buy it off the streets.  i can stop, you know, and she can't. two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then i get my shit together, and for her it's different --
oh, right.  the guy flipped out or something?  killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
i'm not telling.
would you like to tuck him, though? in that car?
not another lecture!  on guard!
some people do it on the pavement
sometimes. when it's convenient.
two are still missing.
please, nathan. i really need this. you've been working late a lot.
you used his credit card.
oh yeah right, like i'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own goofy gus.

whaddya mean?
he... he's here...
whatever you do, just...don't stop.
that's where the what comes in.
two d-6's.  that's the kind his well was fitted for.
you think this is a good idea? we never did this kinda shit before.
oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
leia! leia's my sister.
but what if it does?  you might need my help.
cris, you made it.  thanks a lot.
who's your partner?
my friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  fire it up, doc.
no, please listen!  they're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
the days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  i plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
- thank you, m. but this is more than your man can handle.  are we in agreement?
let me check on scott. he's hurt bad.
well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and i would never do anything to...
it's that kind of selfish attitude that...
we're supposed to.
just shut up.
if he don't know, nobody knows. told you it was eight.
something like that.
what?
well, one thing i suppose, but i don't think it has anything to do with this.  a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted thomas's father working at some gas station outside of peekskill.
yes, sir, i am.
i've heard enough of my safety... what about my father?... i heard you talking. you speak as if he was dead. well, he isn't!
what?
leave me alone!!
so should i come over?
you see anything in the crowd?  anybody suspicious?
since sixteen or so.
it?
make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. there's cars back there, right?
mr. dumbarton.
yeah.
jerry!  do something --
take your time.
a what?
somethin's in my room.
year ago, i come in here on credit card fraud, but after i shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my dunn & broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
even the best make mistakes.
you stand on your tiptoes.
it's bullshit.  everything. my job, the people i get involved with, i'm up to here with it.
no. cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
no, that would be much too overpowering.
literally. it's not a bad deal, gentleman. i get peace of mind. you get detective sheilds. but this is the best part, walter... walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. capice?
what'd it say?
stop, mathilda! don't talk like that!
walked.
anybody at all.  feel free to speak up.
you were supposed to be reading words.
sure... .
mr. murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
they told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... in other words, things of that sort.
i'll worry about that. let's get on with it.
talk has never proved that question, mr. webster!  cup for cup -- what do you say?
what are these for?
i - ran away...
flo, i'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
law school was a mistake. getting this internship was a mistake.
i don't know what has happened to prince joseph.
i guess i got a little overexcited.  wasn't it incredible!  i'm telling you, this is a first.  you know what this could mean to the university?
"can i? i'm amer-i-can!" people ask me where i get this. i don't know, it's... maybe a gift from god or somethin'.
you take tuberculosis.  my smoking doesn't go over at all.
tell mrs. washington i am compelled to stay a while longer.
you're still my best girl, cora.
i believe you said the same thing about the batmobile.
he has his own submarine. i'll be getting everything that matters. i'll get new york and i'll get connecticut.
this is horseshit. it coulda been so easy.
so what's up?  what'd i miss?
jesus, we're trapped!
both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign. autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films.
floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
where is escort service?
i need you to remember me, kate.  how i am right now, right this very moment.  i need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
what's going on?
you've been married twice --
i know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
and you say he doesn't remember any of it?
how fast would you say mrs. driscoll was going?  to the best of your recollection?
bummer, well, i've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
keep your voice down.
evan. stop it. it's not the time.
...lane six. yes.
the caddy?  why don’t you take your own damn car!
i don't want to hurt you, sam.
which you inferred was replaced by the d-6, which must have been a spare.
what?! no, no. you can’t--
make up your mind, kid, i beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven river... .
what is that a threat? are you fuckin' threatening me, marcel?
they'll come out after us.
what are you doing here?
what's going on?
like it never happened...
i got out of there.	i just grabbed up my stuff, and then i found it.
i know... and instead of "dessert" it says "mindbenders."
she was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  and...
you just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
major, that's all i've been told.  just got it on the red phone.  the base is to be sealed tight.  and i mean tight.
we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  let's turn back.
oh, my god, no!  i'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, i'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  i never leave this apartment now.  nobody ever comes here.  i just wanted to get your attention.  i write and i used to lecture on these crimes, but... i'm not competent.
have you lost your mind?
but you're always at the library.
<u>fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
yes. all you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. i'll take care of everything else.
i can't believe you're doing this after i let you tape me.
getting away with things. like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison.
we'll find out soon enough.
you will, dil
well, time will tell, won't it?
we're stuck with this fucking shit...
football in college.
nobody can do anything right but you!
what do you think she is, madeleine? a doll?
i quit.
well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. but our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? this badge doesn't mean that i am a peace officer.
good thing you are beautiful, kid. you are <u>dumb</u>!
you don't have to say anything else. i've known for a while that this was coming.
i don't need this--i know all about my condition.
be careful.
it's a prison, you idiot!  they don't expect anyone to try getting in!  the problem will come when we want out!
tenderness and innocence in denton`
yes, cherie, of course you want more. and i'll show you how to get it. you drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? never again.
i must protect my interests, ms. kyle.  and interest number one, is <u>moi</u>.
my mommy and daddy did that?
i just had a drive; besides, i want to see my brother-in-law michael.
i don't know anymore.
i found the body of the seer in the stream.
aw, gee. i sent her on an errand.
it's important that i learn this.
it was the biggest i could find.
he saved mrs. halpern? please, the twisted fuck.
can't.  doctor's orders.  the low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  it's all right -- i like it here. ever try sex in zero-g?
hermaphrodites! i rented it so we could watch it together!
wonder who his supplier is.
yes.
this could be bigger than "amos and andy."
i don't know anything about computers.
look, stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
oh, honey. if we had one place, we could have a nicer place and i could take care of it. we're almost never here.
you...made that?
what the hell's a freeway?
no. then they were led by his underlings. but i knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of the fortress. they use up much of their strength to do these things. they are taking great risks.
you okay?
what?
i've never dealt in black-jacks. never.  everybody knows that.
it's happening. isn't that a good enough reason?
20 minutes?
there must be over a million dollars in here.
no, i don't.

why would they?
at times. at other times i think she was...more. but who would know that better than you. i mean, you sure 'nough you her.
that's the loch ness monster.  and... kay-- that's... 444-eyes?
far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
where do you get this shit?
oh don't worry kid, i know where you live.  now i want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy yahoo. you got that space cowboy.  y-a-h-o-o. it's a magic word and i never want you to forget it.
you take japanese.
are you kidding?  if they put him in jail he's dead.  he'll never get to trial.
eddie did.
i know this has been painful, spock. for me too. thank you.
it's no problem.  but i must excuse myself, inspector.
well, then, talk to me some more.
different tables.
disappointed?
okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  i don't wanta be here all night.
who's sophie?
sounds like i'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
buff, sit. you know what i mean though? somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
he thought so, yes.
my - name - isn't - bright eyes it's taylor!
snuffed her.
no.  i'd have liked to.
what do you expect to find? a story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
come on...look at her. don't you know anything about women?... the data is skewed. we might as well go with instinct...
where's the old bag i sometimes call mommy?
well, what difference does it make where you're sitting?
it was a place to start.
i think you're swell company, knott.
gilbert!
don't be a smart ass.
answer yes or no.
people always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. all the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
that's an expensive gun.
i promise i'll... i promise, mama.
how is it this hag knows the truth?
this is a travesty.  a debacle.
you don't exist any more. i've killed you. jill layton is dead.
who said i was a lady?
sit down. i don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
where's the rest?
less than you would guess.  most days two to three assistant d.a.'s. a handful of police investigators.
we've done studies.  we're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as chicago.
where am i?
i know, but that was before.
yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
i can't do it! i can't do it!
no. just confidence.
did he have a wife?  did he had a girl friend?  did you know them?
who's our back-up on this?
merry christmas.
i don't....
yeah, but my-
i promised bonanno i'd destroy the tapes.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
now she tells me.
a hundred and eighty dollars?!
no, you're wrong about verger.
you can't really believe that.
thanks.
louella, hello, i was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
it is just a regular card.
the bags under your eyes. you're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
no... maybe that's not the case. maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
i'm sure.
sure...go ahead.
i can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
richard nixon's going to be president. nixon wears hats.
i don't want excuses, i want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
that'd be swell.  you know, you're an awful lot different than i thought you'd be.
better than good, he is a fucking liability.
they may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... other than that, ask what you wish.
that's ridiculous.
well, i... i hadn't thought about it that much. i was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
uh-huh.
i want to make you happy, toto! i'm going to tell you a story.  once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! and he immediately fell in love with her. but what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...one day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end i'll be yours.' christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! one day, two days, ten, twenty...every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. come rain, wind, snow, never budged! the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. he didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. the princess kept watch...and on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
right.  get me everything on indonesia, new guinea, all the way to australia.
your last name.
that's okay. i just have to use the bathroom and then i'll leave.
the witness will substantiate mr. kim's modus operandi. it's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
i'll rephrase the question.  mr. roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
yes, daddy.
sor-ry  we have to do something. he can't wake up half done.
bruce. son. listen to me. you are a kind man. a strong man. but in truth you are not the most sane man.
rowan...
sire, you have only enemies in the court of st. petersburg, and i fear outside your influence, alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
what happened?
it's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
did you always know this was the life you wanted?
you too.
sure, i'll give you a shot at it, but ganz is mine.  you know, that big indian plays it for keeps...
something exotic i hope.
why not? it's charming. i mean, i don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! it's not indecent!  it's highly moral, majesty. it's full of proper german virtues. i swear it. absolutely!
i think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  could you find them and see who they belong to?
they were wrong.  case closed.  this thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for god's sake!
agreed. options?
hey, take your time.  you know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
you got it.
it's not what you think.
nothing, really...
i prefered the terrorists.
how much time?
i got promoted for things like that.
the apothecary? will, what is the story? where is the shipwreck? how does the comedy end?
you don't know me. what, you've known me, two, three months. what do you know?
you?  personally?
what?
oh, it did. it had a great deal to do with you.
maybe we should take it easy tonight.
then you won't like this one.  it's a piece of shit.
really?  the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought 'hey -- i know where anna scott is.  she's in that house with the blue door in notting hill.'  and then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
yes mother.
too bad.  besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
hey bret. christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
frank -- what are you doing here?
yes.
are you open?
he okay?
signs of the lord. they just appeared out of nowhere. i thought you were loco!
no. god no.
i'll be all right.
but, bishop...
pick 'n' save.
i am aware of dr. argon's frustrations.
no!
can you borrow me a dime?
haven't you heard? there's an energy crisis.  no, this was good enough for my mother --
hello!
who was she?
very well, general -- i know you -- all work and no play!
is he married?
i don't know the number.
you're going to stay, aren't you?
not exactly...
to see what your insides look like.
ain't there yet.
thanks marv, i'll make it good to you.  you know what my dream is? one day to be on the other end of that phone...
'if you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
okay, dad.
complain to the bar commission.
my dad said he found you on the golf course. are you sleepwalking again?
keep saying what?
they're alive, aren't they? come on, man! everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 g for the guys who dared to rape her. do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? of course not. or even for your little sister? the virgin? like shit they would.
i'm trying.
yes.
dr. grant, dr. sattler -- you've heard of chaos theory?
i think i could figure it out.
i can't believe it— a small fortune.   you can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'bye, edie. lord have mercy on joey. 
no more tricks, edward. release chase and dick. this is between you and me.
what other stuff?
but it's not like real work. this is just babysitting.
i'll have to think about it. i don't know about them. i do know one thing, we've got a lot invested in you. we'd hate to lose it. even more than those other guys, naval aviation needs a very few, very good men.
then what's he talking about?
sorry, i just design the maze.  keeping the keys secure is your job.
i make maps.
always?
yes, quite.
you're serious.
-- his car. they have it blocked.
what's that, chief?  say again.
this is a highly irregular procedure! this is absolutely unprecedented!
when...when will she be back?
complicated.  i couldn't stop her apologizing.
yes yes... of course.... the "blacksmith's code"...
it's easy. i've done it.
it is important to assure the succession.
i guess so. follow me.
what? me?
i wanted to stop it, i ran up to stop it --
love holds you to me. and we are in danger, not you.
it's not up to you to save me, jack.
we've got too many wounded for us to handle now! get on the phone right away and...
i think it's time to take the gloves off.  get me some reporters.  particularly louella parsons!
mr. scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
i’ll just check into a hotel.
yeah and he doesn't know when --
why?
twice a year.
story of my life.
i know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? rose well, now, mrs. hillyer, i... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
well, if you put it that way...
how was palm springs?
it is too early to implement all the clauses of the seventeen point agreement. we will establish a preparatory committee for the autonomous region of tibet. the pace of reform must meet with the desires of the tibetan people. changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
i can't believe i listened to one word of his shit.
she must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  i'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
sorry.  it's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  tells me she murdered her parents and can prove satan exists.
then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
what?
no.
i'm married, ishmael.  it isn't right for us to be alone.  people will t...
i'm like a joke to them.
max, i'm scared.  are you sure?
budweiser?  you talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence?  that's not beer!  christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
if i let everything that should worry me, worry me, i'd be dead from worry.
i suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
i don't blame you, niki. really i don't. it's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, tv. it's destroying everything. buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. kids think it's normal. they think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
that's what the one who made me said.
i want the girl.  unharmed.  now.
that's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, mr. sheldrake is a married man --
baby names?
jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
miles?
really.  he has a cop's face.
i thought latisha said you would --
we donít have to, jim.  heíll come after us.
no, you're not really getting married?
great.
well -- i was going, but mollie fainted away and i thought i ought to do what i could.
speaking of the vacant post.
there is, of course, another possible explanation which i dearly hope is not the case.
always.
she'd have been so happy, sidney, to know we'd be together.
life must be peachy on planet ted.
i don't know what you're talking about.
that beynon's got a long arm.
what do you want?
and she'll be alive.  up here.
thanks for pointing that out.
he <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. he never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. she's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
dead? mr. bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
did i ever talk about kirsty?
you see, kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
hard to miss.
i'm nervous. malkovich is fighting me hard today.
stable. we're looking at low twenties. it's a good number, considering the fallout from --
what kind?
what is it?
...but he found you.
what will the lady say?
no, i don't want to hear anything. there are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  you are my wife, and they are my children... and i love you and i will not let you leave, because you are mine!
neither does he.  that's where he loses.  this man's scared to death to go to court.  we only have to call his bluff.
yeah?  is that an embarrassing question?  should i have not asked it?
sure. see ya.
i guess i've told you about my condition.
it's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
don't get any ideas. of course it comes out of your share.
you miss him.
the only jobs are picking jobs. picking apples is truly boring.
oh shit!!!
it's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.

can i tell them you won't go back in the water?
--i'm not here.
one's enough.
of course not.
am i right or am i right?
the play? all right, i guess...
fourteen? --
no.  here.
i thought so.
as if.  will you miss me?
up ahead!
they're everywhere. nobody's safe. and sure as hell not in the south. they like warm weather... you'd never believe it. in l.a. it's out of control. first it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
man named turk baker?
within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. if i can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
he'll barely be able to sit up.
finish your breakfast...
isn't there an easier way?
yes.
chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. when do we start down?
forget it. i only mention it to illustrate a point...
who's captain rob?
then i'll be there for you.
what sorry? what you got? you lose my money?? ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
here. get a good seat.
tits -- see.
i swear.  i swear.  we've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.

brilliant!  molly, give me all you've got.  for merk.
no.
he told me to take you to his conference room.
you're right, son. you must care the links with your family, always.  it's the only important thing in the world.
what do you want?
what's that?
no more! you see? watch!
all that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
i wouldn't know. did you ask her?
hey...you flipped--or something? you better take off...
fine. how'd it go out here?
yes... or no?  do you want the deetzes out or in?
looks like we came a long way for nothing.
you're welcome, grace.
i don't like to lose, either.
but that's silly, child. seeing how you feel, why—
oh, and one last item. immortality. you wanted to go on forever.  well, you damn near made it. except for dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. and with stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. you got what you wanted, kid. how does it taste?
sure allan, i'll be there.
yup.
who?
you know how that makes me feel, deb? wanta know how that makes me feel?  angry, deb.  yesss, that's the word, angry. but if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. i want you to be happy, deb.  no matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. be happy, deb. be oh, so very, very happy.
i know...i know.
it's jungle rot!  this room is making everybody sick!  this is your family doctor speaking now.  here--i brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
well, word on the street is you're welsh.
george.
why not?
no chinese man discovered electricity.
lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
i want to do this for you.  i want to do something good for a change.
and she got the medium.
so you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
and what did he do to the girl?
be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system. here. this wooten here -- easy, easy. very rare.
i wish i could be like my momma though. she always knew what was wrong. knew just what to say.
you bet!  they'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
'course i do -- i deliver money for him.
i came back for you; this morning i came back.  before i even knew about the money. you're what i want.
no, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. he didn't leave me. he just ran.  he just ran.
trina honey, he just wants to find arlyn page.
that's okay, eddie, i do.
really?  you know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. you catch things.
it's yours, joe.  i gave it to you.
no! of all...
i'm authorized to get you out of here.  i thought that's what you wanted.
okay, okay.  i need to go say something to julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
you weren't there.  give me time to get some proof.
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists. i'm so sorry i struck you, mrs. peel. please forgive me. i thought you were someone else ...
engine room, what happened?
it's too clean.
overruled...
got any ideas, little brother?
i hope that isn't true. we need all the downy innocents we can get.
but ian, he's still but a boy.
did you find her?
it's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. now granted that's what "true blue" is about, no argument about that.
yes.  john made quite a study of the whole museum.  he had a copy of my original plans.
we got it, men... ho-jon's keep as androscoggin... if there is such a place. and the big news is, the general wants a rematch.
are they nice?
snow shelter.  okay.  you dig. i'll have a little sit-down.
oh.
amy, it's me.  listen very carefully..
we've already begun.
but you wanted to go out tonight. it's my fault that you can't.
no! luke, run away, far away. if he can feel your presence, then leave this place. i wish i could go with you.
i got the woman covered. where you thinkin' about doin' this?
wait a minute, sonny.  i think you better come with me.
this is great, we got cable.
i know. everybody tells me.
i had to ask.  i apologize.
do you happen to have a picture of alan and his wife?
is that a problem?
i don't know.
you aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. we're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
listen, forget the shoes.  i'll just take a cab... uh...
which one is for the car?
...we need the shooting permit for main street...
go on!  get out!  i can fight this thing all alone!
okay then.
why not?
well, i've missed a lot of classes myself...
because everyone knows he's guilty...
i'm not criticizing. _ did you two get any further?
what do you think we're doing, dad?
my suitcase was vibrating?
was.
tell me about it.
domini.
vecchio.
i don't know. i don't know.
engineer, we need warp speed now!
how many employees?
yes, i understand i'm listening.
hold it a minute.
i hope to score big there myself. i'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
what about when you touched it? what did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
what are you talking about?
look i know what i'm doing. i have experience and training in space walking.
i was the next man.
nuh-uh.
-- studying.
is that why you came to chicago in the first place?  because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
i don't know if there's anything we can do.
i don't believe in it.
if you don't have...i mean...
maybe.  sure—sure, i've thought about it. who hasn't? if i ever met the right sort of a girl, i'd—  yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? they don't come that way any more.
bet you like that shit.
do you have many friends?
i'm sorry. at least it don't look like he suffered.
no, son, i didn't get fired.  i'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  how about if we go to a burger king and then we watch a little t.v. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. just you and me...how 'bout that?
what the fuck i tell you. you don't hafta shoot nobody. just hold the gun. they'll get the idea.
just for a few hours.  julie'll be with you.
victory is mine.  i thank thee o lord that in thy ...
because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight i was sort of tied up with steve... but tomorrow i figured on doing just that.
there was a woman. she was trying to help me. i watched him murder her.
the driver was killed. i think there's a connection --
yeah, i don't know how you could make that confusion.
i don't...what if i made a mistake?
not any more.
actually, yes.  it's by no means bad, i...
he was the orderly, during dr. lechter's stay in prison.
well, look, i have to go. gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
it was you who gave valentine peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the ministry.
good.
lapd. open the door.
brimmer! could you come in here please?
hi, hello, great.  this is seduce and destroy?
lost my eyes in vyee-et-nam.  lost them fighting the commies.  fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
because i'm interested, mrs. robinson. now what was your major subject at college?
can we get to him?
it was my specialty, sir, i trained several thousand over the years.
i think that you know.
whoops.
a restaurant in oakland. where no one would recognize us.
oh, jesus....
that's fucking great, barry.  we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  fantastic, barry!
please! leave the house.
how about your two friends?  you don't have a man dying in there, do you?
nowhere in particular.  don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
you're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
whenever you want it. the money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? in a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
well!
i've watched you grow up, ben.
we playing cards tonight?
yeah.
have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
we just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in england as well?
he was right, wasn't he?
and you should know, if i remember rightly.
the blue men?
yes.
his face.  allie, look at his face.
i have to see you.
you're steppin' on sign.
i'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
and who says what is wrong.
yeah, but what happened after she drove off with glenn?
you missed pudge fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
wha-chu-say, palequero? short time, long time, only ten dolla.
if they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
carnations.
i don't understand.
i got eighteen dollars, dude.
i hate--
come on, leah. i can't scope out wannabe parents in the penny saver! that's tacky. that's like buying clothes at the pump n' munch.
i'm trying to buy you a suit.
why not?
hell with him. it ain't that.
coast guard, special detective detail. we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk.
i saw this show once. it was about logging. i was home sick, there was nothing else on. do you know how they break up really bad log jams? you know, when they're really tangled... ?
if she's not up, you can use my shower.
tell me.  please.
what?
i don't do groups.
these burns.  my arms.  ouch...
what's this i see? is that whiskey in them glasses on the bar? roderick, i'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
no, but something's gonna blow in this town. i can feel it.
my business, will.  as for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  this girl -- what does she mean to you?  how far are you willing to go to save her?
romirez is dust.
i had my mouth full. couldn't you hear me?
oh yeah.
you're sure of that?
"then they'd put you in jail."
no, ace.
why is everything about you, jeff?
shall we?
i guess so.  you're a doctor?
he won't steal. i'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. keeps to himself.
make it five.
what about miss lawson?
go in there. talk to her.
no.  i see them.
what's the matter?
you said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
three more chapters to go.
i wasn't waiting for a bus.
blue-green!  hydrated chromic oxide!  remember i'm schooled in chemistry.  i was a hair analyst! briefly.  interior design is a <u>science</u>, delia!  think of me as doctor otho.  and this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
there's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
messina.
yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
no, not really.  more sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
he'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
no! you can't! they're in on it.
oh, how are you, baxter.  they keeping you busy these days?
hello, beautiful.
nothing. can i open my eyes?
he invited me to his house last night.
so one day we'll meet.
the airport? why? are you leaving?
does she know about it? she's in it!
so ... i distract him while you snoop around? how?
we need it.  sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  so we have to take it to the next level. to remind us we're alive.
time to go.
you're right. i'm sorry.  okay, let's go get 'em.
as a "robbery"?!  no.
yeah, well.  i'm working on that.  i've got something going.
and when i'm 38, you'll be 48. and that's not much difference at all.
oh.
okay.
much better now, thank you. just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
i don't like you working with wendy. why are you working with wendy?
i can't do that. and i appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and i do want to help you and i like to do favors, and i know who you are, but i cannot do that.
what the hell.
all right, move! move! rock your chair. do what i do.
no, there's...
we'll take 'em in the morning.
guess you missed it.
good morning, mr. taransky.
the fight.
that's a bit much.
and?
you a sailor man?  that'd be the life.  drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. a man could pretty well disappear like that.  just sail away until all he was was a memory.  i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
no, you're absolutely r...
no. don't stop.
i, i must apologize.  i-i'm, i-i'm sorry.  i'm so mixed up.
it's okay by me, peanut.
not yet.
i'm going to hang up now, miles.
here's my deal -- don't waste my time. what do you want me for anyway? you don't even know me.
this is my home.  i'm part of the wallpaper.
why should they?
okay.  last one to find otis is a smelly old bum.
i don't need you to defend me, y'know, norm.
i'd get over there, terry. i'll take the little lady home.
he's bright.
i'm serious. it was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. he was a rightie, so i made him switch the pencil to his left hand. just to see what'd come out.
you got me.
excuse me, i'm a little deef-a- hearin'. can you repeat yourself?
carl can wait.
you still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
yes.
i wish to speak to ellie mayfair.
look what you made me do!
that's good, hilda. i'm glad.
you should feel right at home with them.
it is?
the army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
if somebody deserves respect, mr. pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
how can scientific truth be heresy? what if taylor is exactly the proof you needed? a mutation. a missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
i'm tired, hector.  i know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
yes, you do recall, right?
no, thanks.  i have everything i need.  drive safely, you hear?
no, i'm -- rescuing you.
no, we're not!
yeah.
well -- as i remember it, we had an argument.
you can't just run home every time things get tough. first of all, we've got enough dough to --
i've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  i don't have the patience for it.  when did you start playing?
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich.
what is?
that's lieutennt hurwitz. severe shell shock. he thinks he's ethel merman.
interesting theory. where's the proof?
i know it is.  right after my parents died, i went to the beach...  i was in the water.  everything was calm.  and then one of those really big waves hit me.  hard.  pulled me straight to the bottom.  i struggled and finally ran out of air.  if it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, i would've drowned. legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
well, webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. how about...hmmmm, someplace small...
why don't you get birmingham p.d. a methane probe out of d.c. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
yes.
i'm in.
how about that jeep?
hold on, coop...
how have you dumped girls in the past?
you can't!
... my god...
you mean the world series? i thought the red sox were winning.
then why go back now?
this is a complicated case, your honor...
you lie.
why the fuck didn't you invite me? i would've come.
wake up?!
how's your arm?
checking my pulse. it's elevated.  you enjoy frightening me, don't you?
hm!
tell him his country is very beautiful.  tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
we?
i see. was that all she said?
are you married?
we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  and pretty lucky for you.
i'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
of course, sir, that's why i've assigned a new man.  and he's no ordinary marshal.  he's quite sophisticated.  three college degrees.  a master of disguise. speaks french...
another accident?  you've really got to be more careful.  can i get you a drink?
i'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. can't you talk for five more minutes?
oh for christ's sake-
you scheduled a whole day with the first lady?
i'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
you bet.
why are you mad at each other?
yup...  the main word there, the file heading, translates as: treadstone.
you are still so very young.
i think...  ...i think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
well bring yo' ass on...
he was all right to me.
want a drink?
they ain't dangerous adele. they're writers.
well, not just one wish. a whole hatful, mary. i know what i'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. i'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and i'm going to see the world. italy, greece, the parthenon, the colosseum. then i'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then i'm going to build things. i'm gonna build air fields. i'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. i'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
gabriel -- !
you're a liar!
is he all right?
because – somehow – they knew i was getting close.  look, it's narcotics... they make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. they'll do anything.  and they can get away with it because they're cops.
oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
how do you know?
or it might be the firing squad!
i can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when looseleaf and i start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  i can hear the alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "we discovered it in the amazon rain forest.  now we cure you with it.  now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
where is he?
oh, you're dressing, uh huh, harry harry harry harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
i thought everything.
thirty-thousand dollars.
yes. it does.
givin' up that switch like a tramp! behind my back and kill my baby...!
we will know when the next one sickens.  until then you and i remain here. i will not bring the plague to my troops.
oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
good. i'd like to book a massage.
where should i be?  where's everyone else?
yeah, i guess... is this my fault? is vanessa mad at you because of me?
i won't be a moment.
you sure you don't want to eat something?
cause i have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. what do you say we cut to the chase. i'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
of course. where else?
the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
still too risky for my money.  we're running out of time here. this is kiss! a victory for one is a victory for the team. i'm sure i can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. we'll reconvene at that intersection...
yeah, i haven't really absorbed that one.
that's why mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
it was in a church...it was so real. i mean, i could feel his breath on me.
and it's over...?
212-555-4240.
you had one guy "like that?"
maybe he ain't so tough.
he's not coming back again. we scared the rascal off, son.  come on back to supper. your mother has a theory about how to educate rose.
don't even.
shhh!
we just take pictures?
you should have more self-control. you were in the army.
i ain't gonna send no roc whore. the woman's cool, i promise.
we're moving' on. i have to pick up the supplies. just two little boxes.
what? oh, yes, certainly.
no.  i...listen, i can't make it in today.
he could always make me laugh.
that's strictly bàader-meinhof stuff.
what's wrong with that?
in my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
we gotta move...
got it.
for seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  we were saved from starvation by the lupi-loopo indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
no, but--
yeah. some help. that poetry really killed her.
they told me you were dead.
you should stay.
i picked them myself. they grow wild up here.  mmm. so sweet.
what you say is wonderful! but sad...
yes.
he's got a houseboat.
he's not gay.  i found out purely by accident, believe me.
does he love you?
first of all, the constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
screw it, i'm going up anyway.
no i didn't.  not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  then they never showed up.
what about fleur-de-lis?  their slogan's 'whatever you desire.'
okay.
i have to get back.
yes.
well, i'm not, sir.  honestly, sir.
i hear that's a rather popular date.
andy, start breaking up some chairs. you'll need weapons.
mr. d. b. norton!
bottom hose was shot too.  rotted clear through. had to put a new one in. runs like a dream now.
i ain't got a hat.
somehow i didn't think you'd wait for me if i'd sent it first.
we can't do our job unless he does his job.
oh, she's really enjoying it.  i think. is mac okay?
you know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  this isn't just any dance.  it happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
i can't clean anything.  the vacuum is out in the garage.  i can't leave the house.  why don't they tell us something?  where are all the other dead people in the world?  why is it just you and me?
this welsh dude is tripping on ruiz cause he's a shot caller.
sentimental fellow, aren't you?
i saw you talking to my mom.
i'll tell you later.
hey! fuckin' a!
come on. i don't want to miss the filing-in. there'll be some i know tonight, i think...
simon just ejected!
yes.
nothing.  i'm not gonna tell him a thing.  the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
how come?
thirty-seven girls. and not one who can carry a tune. that must be statistically impossible.
because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  why should that mean anything to you?
jesus christ, ann. why is anybody anything? i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
hi mom.
i am on the enterprise. i am also here.  think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. a part she left behind.
thank you.
oh, they'll come.  i'll have guild issue the invitations. 
no, this is quite final.  you see, mr. holland is a sugar planter.  he lives in st. sebastian island in the west indies.
hello.
he's my angel.
oh -- i'm not near ready yet.
leon hung himself.
that's precisely what they need.  some uninterrupted rem sleep to release all this negative energy.
i just told you.
he wanted to talk to general ripper, didn't he?
six weeks. but who's counting?
oh, that's not me.  it's just that once in a while, i have some people in for a drink.
no, really. what did i do that was so wrong?
the man's an ambulance chaser ...
-- ass and legs --
imagine that.
this.  this whole god damn thing.  making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  for what?
you was a golden warrior.
have they questioned you yet, sid?
don't need it, i'm a cat, i've got five lives.
well, francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. this is the way of things, but i guess you already know that.
yes, william, uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
i don't want any...
i'm hungry. i'll eat the first child i see. and i've an appointment with young winton at 8:30.
you know what time it is, sid? it's after midnight. it's your mother's anniversary. we killed her exactly one year ago today.
okay -- take a seat.  i'll check.
well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
okay...
i am not!
i can't help it, i'm just taller than you.
dad...dad... there's... i need to...
yes.
it's not your fault.
i cannot be certain.
good night, then.
they'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. and they can talk about what they do. what am i going to say?  "i killed the president of paraguay with a fork."
where's the challenge in that?
let's watch some tv.
... not yet.
--or a tail--
immigration officer?
speaking of which...
no.  she tink lobo is waste of my time.  lobo don't talk.
you can't listen. you can't watch either.
don't worry, honey, i'll protect you.
maybe hawaii.
ah, did you hear that?  spooky loved you...
yes, she will. you see if she isn't. and i'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
i know who you are, doctor venkman.  busting any ghosts lately?
the strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year i'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
what?
no. i have a cellmate. his name's carl.
the idea is simply this - that i want those people to leave here immediately.
oh, it was such a big scandal.
'e.g.' means 'for example', ray. i think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
yes indeed.
huh?
she fucked me.
about fifty grand.  i won it at the tables.
wish you weren't.
found what?
well you know his blokes'll place the oscor in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
either it goes to mitchell or it comes here.
three...
yes. dorothy -- ah -- dor --
so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
secret recipe.
what did i say?
lucky.  lucky, lucky, lucky.
what you thought!? what you thought... i'm a workingman, i'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
i need thirteen.
really.
i want to go home.
the picture starts at eight-fifty.
her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. she had some bleeding but it's under control.
get the fu-  you threatening me?  i'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  get up and go home right now.
street cats?
yeah, i'm quittin'.
whatta you wanna do?
omar, listen to me--
you can tell father murray to --
i love red!  that's my favorite color!
there's the way, mates.
can the maker repair what he makes?
what do you mean?
don't you want nice stuff?
the "now i get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  that list.
then why did you leave?
well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. remember i sold those three m-60 machine guns outta the five i got?
start back up the waterford sentinel. town newspaper.  show you the plans...
then we're screwed.
just past boise city.
i'm a junior.
you didn't wake me.  i'll be out of here in a minute.
c'mon, get real, will you. you think he's just going to forget about this? these guys are all about respect. all about honor. he's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
of course she knew! for one thing, addison told her how superbly eve had read the part-!  karen, let me tell you about eve. she's got everything - a born actress. sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
ext. fort leavenworth - ten years later - day.
too hot tor those two?  i can't believe it.
yeah.  you could say that.
i'd vote for outer space.  no way those are local boys.
taking my pleasure.  do i need to clear my lovers with you?
you were in bed.  weren't you?
wait a minute.  just listen to me...
see!
that's true ... wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... this is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
he has a wife?!
i thought we had a deal about you watching cnbc in bed.
want to go? let's go back in.
i think you have your answer.
wake up!
you're not trouble by any chance. are you?
tomorrow.
very well, mr. chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... but i must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. if indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
and i'm the feet.
how could he?
oh, sure.
goodnight, you idiot.
i think i need my glasses.
ask her, she's a heroic fireperson. she does this twenty times a day.
it feels so.. .real.
c'mon, mommy.  daddy hasn't been impressed with anything i've ever done.  from winning my fifth grade spelling bee to the present.
- i'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the prime minister. but this is, still, a naval operation.
i will.  i'm trying.  meanwhile i got some crack left, you wanna get high?
no.
it was six in the fucking morning.
tom. how's it going?
i'm an orphan.
of course not. not when you've got so much going for you.
martini out!
actually, no. i've got everything under control. i'd like to clean up myself a bit. i'm going to take a bath. dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
my eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
it doesn't matter. you want to now. you should want to. it's your obligation, your duty.
you're getting out of hand. i don't know what's come over you today.
this could go on for hours.
why not?
one hundred percent.  and i like him that way.
i knew that.
it feels really... good... here.
he's not that old yet.  you've lost confidence in me.
don't worry about coming up with anything. it's cool.
whatever you say, rat.
what?
our love is god. let's get a slurpee.
just call me barney.
he said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because i was civil.
don't do that. please.  or i'll kill you.  please, danny.
i think that's called looting.
actually, i scalped him, and then you killed him.
keys.
what was that all about?
what's fleur-de-lis?
jake. jake pearson. i go to lawschool with your daughter. carolyn. we met once or twice.
she left you, nikko.  she's not your responsibility.  she takes very good care of herself.  if she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  your business is to snap out of it.
and why should we believe you?
somewhere in utah.
not a whole lot. we take some classes together. he's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
yes, my lord.
tell them anything you want. tell them i'm on a vacation, a business trip. tell them i needed a rest. tell them anything, just don't tell them...
i can save you the trouble. you're nutty as a fruitcake. i love you anyway.
guess what?
okay.
no thanks. i got close but it never woulda worked.
i don't believe you.
yes.  i care about you.  i did it for you.
from whence did it come?  our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  of armed and violent dissidents...
yeah.  but all things being equal, i'd rather be in philadelphia.  by the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
he was going to take away all my data, equipment --
i don't want you talking to jerry.
it was done to stop me from talking about a section of the appropriations bill!
i'm begging you...please don't kill me! please!
no, holly's game for anything. holly takes after me.
she turned me out of the bed.
just that it's been a perfect day and that i'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
of course, how stupid of me. a quarter to seven, will that be all right?
oh.  okay.
now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. for the kids there's the butch, or the heinie...
we'll take the car and drive all night. we'll get drunk. we'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
i'm a simultaneous translator -- like sylvie, only she's english to french -- i'm french to english. that's what i did before i married charles. the police probably think i killed him.
god saw to it to put you in my path. and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
24-hour tail on taransky?
it's not true.
how long you been married?
he says he loves me.
nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
i'll just set it right here.
you have to ask like that?
goddamn it barnes this really steams my onions!
this is a done deal.  all but the paperwork.
there must be an answer somewhere.
"paranormal"  but -- you read the transmission.
keep it tonight.  we'll catch fish. i'll see ya back on the docks...
yes...
settle down. i have a plan which i think will work. there is very little for you to do, but i do need your help. aren't you curious about my plan?
i'm joe riggins.  sit down
michael, come on, don't be silly. this is the quickest way.  you're not going to walk all the way around?
why can't i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  ask a few questions.
took 'em all.
how old do i look?
and wasn't that an oath...? these are your initials here: k.c. when you signed this chart you took an oath. no less important than that which you took today.  isn't that right?  isn't that right...?
timmy!  the power is coming down, quick!
not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... look!  cory's going for second!... sneaky!
kat ellis! we live two hundred miles away from each other but i have to fly all the way to london to see you. you haven’t visited me once in d.c. where the hell have you been? i have gynecologists that call more often.
i think it's still available.
are you totally stupid?  what does it look like?
i tried a little while ago. the phone's dead.
no, i did not.
positive?
tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a uv laser going.
where's the plow?
oh, rubbish!  you have no power here. be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
i never knocked over any armored- car. i was sent up for practicing law without a license.
never mind it? that's not my money! that's bruce's money!
a cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- i think the power of the house fades at dawn.
ma'am, i answered your question.
ancient greece.  alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
i didn't aim to.
for one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
the slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
try and burn through the ropes.
okay.
now when i see him with shelly, sometimes he seems like the old harry.
i'm never going back in that house again. get away.
he farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
get the car.
polar bears.
oh, that 'dukes of hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
i can just imagine.
really? both of you?... why not?
yes, of course. miss ramsey telephoned me. well, what would you like to have?
anything you need.
what color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
come here a minute, fredo.
you're not getting any navy contracts.
miss caswell, at the moment, is where i can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
hey, listen... i'll give you something else, kittle.  anything. remember... remember that corpse washed up on huntington beach?  it was never identified...
it was all keaton. we followed him from the beginning.
even as a boy i thought so.
really, jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? five times a day?
i once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  all the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. i saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
you know, i just can't do that anymore.  i still have time to get things right.  get married again --
and why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? these people don't make mistakes, agent mulder.
high school physics, luthor. while i was recuperating i had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
not now, chewie.  lando, aren't you afraid the empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
just jim.
i don't know. i think she's breathing.
no one's saying you did.
i don't-don't know how they get through life. it's amazing to me.
no.
why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
susan, don't go!  susan, please!
they're not costumes.
that's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
is he all right?  is he all right?
alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
what chip?
it is cocktail hour yet?
a fine fair-weather friend you are!
you busted?!
you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
eight o'clock! why, that's twelve hours!
the red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. yes. it is the only way.
nothing...nothing at all.
that's it -- syndrome. so you know all about it?
i'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
this is serious. nobody can know. ah, i've returned from the future. i traveled back here 25 years.
good night, daddy.
yes, you should.
well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
we're half-brothers.  paul is mother's first child.  when his father died, she married my father. dr. rand, the missionary.  and you know what they say about missionaries' children.
i, uh, don't really know any.  we - -
where's sean?
like popcorn?
how do you know about that?
this way, miss.
just because i'm not a vanderbilt, all of a sudden i'm white trash? i grew up in bel air, warner! across the street from aaron spelling! i think most people would agree that's way better than a vanderbilt --
nothing! i simply existed. so what was the answer? a jealous woman, right? a clinging possessive mother.  wrong. with all due respect to oedipus, i don't think that was the case at all.
oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? i've never been inside. but it looks so lovely, driving past.
oh, now, pop, i couldn't. i couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
nothing good.
me?
keep it together, claude. you wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
i couldn't have another bite.
get back!
no!  but let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
sorry, sir.  uh... here's what we got.
oh, yeah? what is this, anyway?  let me see. okay, let's... oooh, god!  oh, you knew i wanted this...  god, it's terrific, god!
you're referring, of course, to chairing the special operations group as vice president.
you saw west, right? how was he killed?
there's no lights back there.
oh that's nice for you.
it wasn't you. it was somebody else. there's somebody else aboard.
i am calm!
how can you not think so? you know the things i can do.
the doctor harry used to go to. he was passing just after it happened.
every day?
i beg your pardon?
what?
nothing to discuss. tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. be grateful for small mercies.
that's what they're going to ask you.
don't bother me, norman.
i'm never unfair.
i shall want you for always.
we should talk alone.
alas, no.
you were partners with him on some slag -- uh, newcomer real estate thing.
i broke up with my roommate -- he was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
yeah.
i know it, and it feels good.  hi, ty.
we're going to get off, all right.  we'll get you off of there.  just...be cool.
this way.
ya know, entry level!
a natural athlete can play any sport. any sport.
you'll be sorry.
why yes. how did you know?
what are they going to do? not invite me to their birthday party...?  look, i gotta go. i have to be in cambridge...
it's not about gas money!!  you have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! not the actor -- whose name is george, by the way. his character!
yes, well, it's all good fun.
i... i'm not sure...  ...i... oohhh... excuse me...
you'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
i got the diamonds.
miss teschmacher, superman is a fairly bright individual. my understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
don't talk like that to him!
you had no inner feeling?
what kind of man?
jeez, what's the difference? just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
i can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'phone book killer'.
i know you want to.
i went over last night, too.
of course not.
you are as radiant as ever, violet.
hello, quince.
he was convicted in a court of law. your testimony put him away. it doesn't matter what i think.
oskar -
what is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? it's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
hey, don't worry. chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
relax. think about the 25 million dollars.
we can't let him run around.  he knows too much.
yes.
so, that's it. i'm out?
we can't go back.  we had something very special, but it's all over.
there an echo in here? your objection's been recorded. she typed it into her little machine over there. it's on the record. so now i'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. does it act as a drug?
uh...i thought you might know a trick or something.  to make her, you know...
so what were you fucking around for, then?
we'll convince them.
i don't know. maybe a hotel.
didn't paden tell you that?
goddamn you! that's trespassing!
get out!
right.  got lost in the rocks.
now let's get down to business.  kuato wants what's in quaid's head.  and he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  now i have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --do you think you can play along?
yes, ma'am.
because he's dying.
you know what they say.  if you have to ask --
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
buying her?
then, what <u>are</u> we, drew?! the <u>winners</u>? "ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of aids goes to andrew beckett and his lover miguel..." excuse me, i'm not your lover. i'm your care partner. fuck!
you do know me.  you helped me once.
easier than that, jack.  screwball!  fetch me down a couple of them plates.
no, did he tell you about it? about the business childs ran?
oh yeah, i figured that. how much?
how about new york?
check.
and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl!
let's go.
what?
i made a decision, because i have to consider the integrity of the scene.  i can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
i think maybe you'd better deliver him. let me give you my address. 
pack it into black garbage bags. throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the fang shan restaurant in china town.  you have twenty-nine minutes left.
but not no more. now people take advantage. bowling ain't what it used to be. there's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
everyone get some sleep.    we're leaving in the morning.
just a habit. mr. schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
c duracell.
well, i'll have to look someplace else.
mm hmm.
who's responsible?!
tommy, take a walk.
the f.b.i., the c.i.a.  you name the initials and they're down there.
you can stop it right now.
no, that's fine.  it's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major hollywood star.  it was a thrill for me.  how is he?
david, please --
what do you think i'm doin'?!
stay away from the garden district. serious crime. i don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
with respect, sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
no harm done.
all right. after school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to detroit rock city.
exactly what i said. i'd trust him before i'd trust you. how much clearer can i be?
bring him.
i didn't forget. i was just working on a tangent. see, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
can i show you something?
that won't happen, billy.  mitch stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  the way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  i know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  that'll be the end of it.
crystal.
yeah.
you get any sleep last night?
what sign? fuck the sign. i want my car.
a policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
we are only moving six hundred people, jean-luc.
have you still never told him?
how about that. well, you always were a screwball.
how come you didn't close your eyes?
damn nigga, don't jack the joint.  i didn't even pass it.
i know, mother sister, but i'm here now.  where's the stuff?
brenda, are you okay? come sit.
well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
i don't think so, he should be along soon...
warn me? will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
well i like your style too, man. got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
where you guys at?
in a word: merk. exposed.
i was looking for annabelle's book, and i found your tickets.  and the note.  from your new boss.
for half a million?
just one favor.
then let's go. now!
it's great.  you wanna speak to mary? hold on...
but--if he *does*, joe--
i know what you mean.  i...
no, no, not beyond an acceptable level. have you been x-rayed recently, martin?
ed?
yes, i am.
that fool. that damn fool.
no, now i can't kill you.
he's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. it's no big deal. me, him, and sooze are gonna...
he's good people, mr. reuben. i swear.
i am understandably curious.
why don't you tell me.
what happened to jimmy?
it would be five thousand more.
i thought i'd wait for you.
please, be quiet.
now listen, swana... i sold monsieur guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne. "the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia"!
great.  terrific.  the good guys won one for a change.
demented.
...no.
beth --
what is it really?
i prefer distrusting you. it'll keep us honest.
i'd go for penetration.  the 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
we move.  place to place.
patience.  concentrate.  you will find a way.
yes or no?
they come in any other styles or colors?
sure.
wally.  this is danny witwer.  he's from justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
you mean, like, "he has the cutest butt"? where did i hear that recently?
i'm afraid i'm a little rusty yet.
but i don't know love... i'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
oh.
my wife's jewish. but that probably doesn't matter right now.
and do you remember where she got off?
 come on!
i'm sorry.  it's just ... you know ...
those aren't mine.
why i do what?
and if he alters it...?						*
fewer will survive them.
of course.
not to mention court reynolds. unfortunately, ronald's moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder.
dickie hasn't killed himself. i'm sure of that. there's a private detective on the case now -- a mr maccarron -- dickie's father's employing him.
there's no child here.
yes -- that is true.
it's alright janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
i'm sorry, i --
i think i'll...carry him.
no, i don't think so, sail. i just need to lie down.
victor, tell me why! trust me!
yes... a kiss... salute!
i see.
continue on course. chekov, any signs of federation escort?
and who's this susan when she's at home?
if he had, you’d be dead.
don't play simple with me, jake. you want me to spell it out for you? i'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money.
shhhhhh.
how 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
look, jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. it's my show here.  that's that.
to me it is. he doesn't trust me. why should i trust him?
that's cor...
they didn't fire her?
these dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved dr. satan working at the looney bin. i'll bet he amputated her arms.
nothing.
i'm trying.
i don't know...
sir?
indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
what -- what is it? last night...
no, just some crazy fucker. cut half his ear off.
perm?
 oh...
it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. especially if you're over near the bay.
i've seen those in magazines.  they're not cheap.
oh, it must be two weeks. yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
they must stay sharp.  there was an attempt on the king's life today.
listen to me -- i can't do anything about what you're going to do. i can't change anything.  i can't stop you.  i just want some information...
i can show exactly.
well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
may i add, sir, that it was with great amazement that i found a copy of karl marx's capital on your night table. that is a socialistic volume which i refuse to so much as dust, sir. i view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this bolshevik lady.
true.
thanks.  but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year. and then i thought "gee. that seems awfully silly. that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
well i didn't know about you until after she was gone.
no.
no.
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
you are the dumbest person in the world.
you never fail at anything, do you, chad?
well... who are those guys?
what did i do to deserve this?
understood.
good.  good.  that's nice.  that's very nice.  i think i'm coming out of it now.  yes.  yes.  i'm definitely coming out of it.  thank you for smiling.  it helped a great deal.
oh good, i'm worse... are you really twenty-two?
i thought you hardly know her.
is that the only way you can succeed, anton, to see me fail?
no --
excuse me, mister... i'm looking for mister rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and i got lost...
thank you very much.
it's midnight. one half of paris is making love to the other half. look at the clock. one hand has met the other hand. they kiss. isn't that wonderful?
they were familiar when i painted them.  that one's copied from a dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  and that's a rembrandt.
and what will we do when we get there? i'm sixty-five years old, ray. so are you. what are we gonna do out here? get married, have kids, settle down? that boat sailed without us, man.
crank or glass?
you will.  you will.
oh-kay...
he would not have gone into the western woods.  no sane man would.
well--i haven't needed much law so far--what i'd like to get first is a little common sense--
of course, yes. just what would you like to know, inspector?
i knew it, i knew it all along - shit!
i wish it were that easy...
this guy's only half cooked. there's no time to fuck around, stan.
honest, i feel fine. you better be married.
the heelots!
sacred herbs. tobacco. don't worry, we don't smoke no mexican agriculture in the pipe. that's a white man's myth. this is a sacrament.
you- they cannot believe you're still here.
i... i'm very sorry, but i never open. i'm very sorry but i never open the door to strangers after dark.
you're a bastard.
not so loud.
she says a lot of things.
you think i manifested the snakes?
i want to help you, will. you'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. we don't invent our natures, they're issued to us.  along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. why fight it?
no, my beloved, my child.
what happened in those three minutes...?
getting to what?
how will playing cards help?
that's about the only thing i don't do – that i'm built for. i inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. sometimes i tend bar and act as bouncer.
then what do you do? do you meet someone?
no, don't!
hey, captain kirk.  i think maybe i have second thoughts.
the average first offender gets two years for burglary. we were all first offenders. that's what sophia and peg drew --
i see your point.
that's exactly... i could have taken that same picture, this morning.
that's me.
a census taker once tried to test me. i ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... fly back to school, little starling.
charles street?  in the village?  when we were living in greenwich village...?  great times.  why’d we ever leave?
then it's going to be 'i killed for sex'... listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ellen carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. you haven't written anything in four years darling - i know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
how'd you meet early?
i'm disgusting.
what is our target in time?
nossir.  i'd gone to tell the wid... to tell mrs. heine.
this can't be settled any other way now...i'll take full blame.
no, i told you...
drew!
it's not worth it. be with them instead.
...i've lost something. i must get it back.
she certainly has.
burglary?
where did you get -- ?
of course.
you had left me! i kept silent out of rage.
i kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. it'll be a lot less scary. you have to go.
i've stopped a hundred times.
new orbit commencing... coming up on sector three...
eventually, cassius. but first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
they could have been put away. anderton could have found them.
if you're selling something, i'm late for work...
you'd better be kidding.
m'hm.
examination and interview materials are confidential. we've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
easily.
-- see this, television!
hey--what are you thinking about?
the blood transfusion.
but you like that in a man?
of course! that's exactly what i want.
did you ever see the sun come up over the rockies?  it hits all of a sudden and below there's california and you swear you're looking at heaven.
what's that?
no problem, boss.
why not just go now?
desi's got a point.  what the hell are we gonna do about the communists right here in our backyard?!
no.  i did not.  i have never told anyone this, neo.  after i saw the oracle i thought... no, i misunderstood what she told me.  i believed that it was all about me. that i would find the one, not that he would find me.
some of us citizens are with you all the way, officer.
five...? yes. no. we're done today
oh.
hello. what are you up to?
i just say what the other person would say?
madame, let me ask you: who is m'sieu laval, anyhow? where does he come from? what is he?
it wasn't me before, james.  it's become me now because of...what's happening.  please untie me.
he's here!... he's here!
it's been a long time, general.
i don't mind her if you don't.
i love secrets.
what the fuck am i afraid of?!
they have done...nothing...they are my people...
gwen...
do you know what she told me last night?
true.
oh, yes, grandmama - i wait until i hear...
you are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and i, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
i never intended you to be.
the man you had the fight with.
thank you, miss -- ?
...haven't we already paid him for his services?
"you do get the opportunity...you get them.  as i do, as anyone does..."
either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
yeah... you said that last night.
mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
it's all right.  it's not hurting...
well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
she's asleep.  i think that's what i need, too. i'm starting to see things.
what?
no.
not that i don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
let me put it to you this way... whether i'm here...or whether i'm not...i'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
no, no... there's plenty for everybody... oh, max, this is sam... and the frog brothers...
i want it...
my guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
that's right.
well, you know, i-i-i...you know, if you want me to, i'll read it.
yes.  no! you can't! you've only just turned it down! 
no!
three including you.
i'd take her, but then who would stay here?
it shouldn't have. but it did.
kiki -- he won't hurt you. there's nothing to be afraid of.
what?
what is it, drugs?
i love lila. i mean, she's a wonderful person. and... she loves me! that's no small potatoes. i mean she really loves me. she's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. and she's a good person. a truly good person. how rare is that in this world, eh? and how could i stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. i mean, god knows i'm not perfect! what about my eyesight? it's lousy, that's what! lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. what about my penis?
i just need some time...
you're back!
okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
no, that's okay. thanks, though.
only give me leave to ride out again, to do what i am most able to do, and happiest doing.
uhh... i don't know.
you win, inspector.  you win all along the line.  why didn't we think of brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  yeah.  of course you did.  when a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. wait for a mistake.
do we still get paid for the week?
sleep well.
i'll work on it, ma'am.
there was no card.
yeah.  the big boys sent it down yesterday.
blind faith is what i consider heresy!
it's not really something i think about.
so what's wrong with her?
and not a nickel.
what good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
she brought it in.  trying to make me believe she did it.
but you never can tell. why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
what?
you won't.  that's why you're whispering.
exactly! i speak seven languages, including hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. how about you? kill somebody?
i didn't get her number.
in my heart, heather's still alive.
thanks you.  six weeks off does a body good.  i heard she got the approval to try the reversal with edward.
my father told me i shouldn't talk to you.
here.
oh, waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
you're not going, are you?
alive?
if y'all don't shut up i'm gonna go out of my mind. and plus you're liable to bust a spring in karl's head. he's already off balance.
glad to know you, senator. meet the boys--
i just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
in time.
bobby cooper.
yeah.  can't wait to see him  i just saw quincy.
we've got a huge problem with the magazine, ted-baby. our readers hate it. hate it. we need to talk.
yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
nothing. i'm just at work and i'm wondering, you know your friend lena?
perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and i see the questions first. then i decide if i grant the interview.
come on.
don't worry. thanks.
yeah.
it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all i did here was follow orders. it didn't add up. plus, i got kicked out.
no, stay. just for a little while.  refill?
but that's no what worries me the most...it's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
oh, yes.
taken care of.
thanks, dad.
fine with me.
no, laddie.  it was a <u>memory</u>.
isn't her album called "number four with a smile?"
get out of here ike, you're too young for this stuff!
keep them coming?  ah, yes.  ha ha.  you are right.  but money.
all my life i've known.
at breakfast.
dude, i'm--it was an accident!
but... why... what's the point?
what happened next?
i'll walk you out.
famous? i've never heard of it.
50 k don't get you to first base in the big apple, dad, not any more. i pay 40% in taxes, i got a rent of 15,000, i got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, i need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
it's about fucking time, kessler! i'd just about given up on you.
yeah.
at the muncie college of business administration.
c'mon, beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. it'll work.
look over there.
you give me a pain!
she said michael.
he's not part of the program.
hey -- you believe what you want. shu kai kim is innocent.
well, you can't do that. you're a free man. you've been let out to do as you please.
what?
yah, how ya doin'. so, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
call it.
they only cover one fifty in incidentals. you've been ordering fucking... motherfucker...
ow.  he's gotta be more careful in the water...
see that wasn't so bad.
no.
sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
it's nothing too hard or anything.  i'm just going to... look for someone, and... i want you to be sort of a... guard. okay?
i thought i was.  i was confused.
you wouldn't know it. it doesn't matter. what's the difference?
liquid metal.
and i didn't like that man.
it's touching me.
exactly.  break it to her gently.
that's not you having a whiskey sour with carmine morada.
what do you mean "basically"?
what's wrong with your back?
listen.
he yours, sir?
right. she doesn't stop talking about you. you're always on her mind. that's love, jake.
i can't do it, artoo. i can't go on alone.
just hold up a second, captain -- i'll get to you soon enough -- we've got things to do here.
i just got out here!
i wish.  you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission.
dig.
yeah, and what might that be?
think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
you ever think about gettin' remarried?
lots of institutions. my graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. for a while i was chief therapist in a shopping mall. had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
i made this place..... now listen to me. i'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
no, sir...
and you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
ooh-kay...
that's the problem. he did.
in the leg.
if this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. but he's george winton and they're playing him up. it's a roman holiday for every paper hat editor in new york.
i'll keep in touch.
not criticize -- plead.  love.  love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  love women, and they will love you.  love yourself, and --
what was edmunds doing outside?
i don't want to hear public enemy right now.
sheriff potter, please.  i can't go to jail.  i wanted no part of it.
right now only ambrose knows that.
explosive. we're blowing the walkway.
leeloo! listen to me! i'll take you on a vacation afterwards! a real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. come on! you can do it!
and you were worried about me. that's nice, i appreciate--
you - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
please?
...you-you spoke to him?
right then.
marty.
yeah.  i'll see ya... dad.
sorry, mom.  it was a mistake. i thought i saw something out the window.  i was reading this horror comic and i guess i go a little carried away...
you called the casino a cesspit.
jesus lives, luis.
call me later.
do what?
i'm relaxed.
it's helms -- it's got to be.
that's right. the word only means "community." but it could stand for "village"... or the world.
hello, george.
-- power too -- promise me that --
that's right.
i helped you because i'm an idiot! ask my mother, i love it when people take advantage of me! i trusted you!! i thought he was real!
that's fucked it. what do we do now? no money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
it was no time to lose my partner. we're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
sorry.
god almighty -- whew.  do i mind? why do i mind?  i do mind.  what a shock -- i don't have a right to... i don't think i like him.  i know i don't respect him...so what am i talking about -- what am i saying to you?
very weird.
just until we get things under control.
what? what've i done?
sure.  he was trying to make us his family.
well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
you are neither, claudia. now stop this --
that's what we should've done in the first place.
you are right.  but it is a trap.
indeedldid, mylord. itwas one ofthe first to cross.
we're friends of beckett's.
are they true!
if you're asking my opinion, no. i'd read it to greer over the phone. ask him if he had any objections.
...gotta run dad. you stop smoking, you hear?
do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
no, it was the perfect level.
no!
you go wait in the car. wait a minute.
how come?
i don't eat waffles.
sometimes when she talks that way to me i'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  or at least, defy her.  but i couldn't. she's ill.
where did you get those pants?
then, i also have a gift for you. true magic which even you will not be able to deny.
what are you going to do? shoot me?
see. there's an example. i don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
knowing i have to die...
yes.
i should go
no kiddin'! i'd need the cash pretty quick there. in order to close the deal.
did you stop to talk to anyone, judy?  do you enjoy that?
well--that's very fine.  saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
the movie's about <u>purity</u>.  so we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  we show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
like you couldn't believe.
too bad! brings our price down ten thousand francs!
i got twenty or so in my purse. give me what you've got.
no doubt paul thinks it stinks.
what of it?
check.
a criminal?
no, that's not, i couldn't...
superb.
shh! is that so hard to believe?
you can still make a choice! make the right one now!
no, of course not.
how long have i been on gateway station?
do you understand?  my stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  i'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
faith.
i'm sorry, sir, but as far as i'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
anger.  rage.  frustration.
it was necessary.
joe --?
fine.     ten o'clock.
off....
i told you. he gave them to me.
you just move in here?
and you love him a lot. he bought you a bmw for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. i mean, i know, it's time to leave the nest. parents hate your smoking. you didn't tell them about the abortion. all your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. subscribe to vaniety fair.
from now on it's e-v-i-l, no exceptions!
how long has dolores been driving that bus, mr. otto?  how many times has she steered clear of danger? what went wrong that morning?
you ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. you can go down to the sheriff's office.
you haven't answered my question.
what do you know about him?
i'm doing this wrong, aren't i?
i told you, leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
wish me luck!
i'm sorry, miles. we did all we could. you've been a real trooper.  tell him i'll call back.
lloyd was such a gentleman.  he was funny and nervous and strange, and i met people that i never would have met before, then i blew it.  i called him basic.  can you believe i did that?
you thought i meant...too tough to apologize, huh? you must have been a very lonely girl.
what do you say, dodge?
... two-thirty-seven.
i'm sorry miss weathers. allow me to introduce myself, mark kincaid, l.a.p.d.  are you familiar with the actor ben damon, or the actress christine perkins?
i'm intrigued.
susan.  what are you doing?
what?!?
it didn't discourage you, though.
...are they hard to get?
why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? especially after i got you such a nice job.
keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
the hell you didn't!
screw you too, kitty.
alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
what? i'm just kidding around with the customers... it's my shtick!
all he's asking is for you to check it out.
the bachelor party's upstairs. they made me get naked. they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down...
at that point it became every man for himself. as far as mr. blonde or mr. blue are concerned, i ain't got the foggiest. once i got out, i never looked back.
yes, dear!
why?
i can't.
do you?
couple of days.  anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
listen, i bag this stuff anyway.  it may as well pay my rent.
i must go where i can be of use.
numbers? no, never mind.
fine. don't come crying to boyd. no sir.
if i'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. that way she'll let me go.
i am telling the truth.
you check it....
then you should.
cuz i want new york.
what else is ballast for?
yes.
come with me now! come with me now. come with me now. i want you out of here.
by a strange coincidence, i was thinking of you.
see that sign -- we retain the right to refuse service to anyone. i'm not going to charge you for this session, but i don't want to see you back here.
julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
it's actually been giving me freddy nightmares.
but, i didn't ask him to kill.
i don't know...i mean: i don't know.
oh, yes... well, doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
no.
i like this music.
we did your mom a favor, sid. the woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was sharon stone or something.

tell him you love him.  with all your heart.
i have plans.
no!, he's fine.  fish are very resilient animals you know. don't worry, i won't get another fish.
wait, i think i have them sighted.  what's the word, frank?
were you asleep?
smile?
what makes you think i'd go for that bet? that's a seventy thousand dollar car.
i think they hear you!
all true.
sure, like i'm gonna take advice from you.
he can learn to be phillippe in time.  but first he must learn to be louis, and for that he has two more days.
because my mother gave them to me. what do you care?  they're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
i wouldn't know what to do with it if i did.
and you, dr. cappucino, you're lucky i don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  i'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
look, there's something you should all know.
up there! i would put it up there!
it was so obvious. i mean, all of nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
i didn't.
where did they get those outfits from? haven't we got some like that, tom?
wait a minute, wait a minute. she's unconscious?
clever girl.
<i>here's the part where i'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until i speak with my attorney.'</i>
yes, that would be great. are you her for the convention?
you think they're still up there?
well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
you're fucking crazy richter--you know that?
no!!!  what do you think i am, crazy???
you have to get out of here.  if tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  he's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  he's such a control freak, he's even paying max to follow me around.
what?
these are your initials, 'k.c.'?
eh?  si!  avanti!
there are only two other alternatives for him.
two years of surgery.  i missed my window.  limped through law school instead.
you will be a jehovah's witness. i have a few "awake" magazines for you. you don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all i'll need. whatiya think?
love demands it.
what happened?
no bela, that's "incorporates."  look, just say "this casket has..."
whoever.  they're the ones.  they'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
do people die in italian operas? gentlemen, if all goes to plan nuclear man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce superman's skin. he'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
yeah, that's a good idea, turkle. why don't ya take rose on a little tour of our facilities...
my hat?
no . . . no . . . no. . .
i think we sort of found each other.
it's dangerous to use a power source on earth. it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
just making me feel like a piece of meat.
he can't be far away.  find him. go!
well you know what i mean.
you've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  all those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
come on, george, no one is going to pay that.
i'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. everything'll be all right, preysing... don't worry. goodnight.
when it comes? what'd you tell him?
what do you want on it?
i said no!
right, right, sorry.
doctor derek sommersby? you mean from "one life to live"?
i'm sorry. let's go.
exactly, charlie! you understand what i'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. because you're a real man!
i have to go.
i couldn't stop myself.
not particularly.
i gotta meet natalie for dinner.
i don't think so. where was it that you think we've met?
finished with these?
what we gonna do?
i am actually ... glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
- michael, his driver's an aussie, new to me.  then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
i'm at sea, jason.
i'm one of his people.  the cubans are his people.  and we're going to jail for him.
alright... the abc telemarketing company?
so what?
those girls drove off because of you.
a moth... how did you predict that?
i think i love you, alex --
oh. i'm sorry. gideon, what do you say?
don't be so literal. ray believed it.
... the gardener?  ... yes, of course... mr. chance, this is ms. hayes.
yeah.
that's so sweet, michael. but, really, i've so many things to do.
of course, where you been kid?
you're saying no.
where?
where are you going?
you saving me? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
arlyn was a junkie; i'm not on junk!
oh for fuck's sake.  nobody uses that gate.
shu lien...
you look wonderful.
... thank you.
what is it, noontime?
make love to me, 'nine? i want you to make love to me. please, please make love to me.
yes.
no way that could just be seawater.
i'm sorry, mary.  my old dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
i have to get in there.  i have to stop this flight.
it's time to put this person where he belongs.
chase. hi...
no.
i should have killed him when i had the chance?
they're rounding up a posse.  figure an hour?
no buts. now. out.
you're an asshole.
been better, buddy.
what the hell is this ?
he told me to be careful as one of goebbels' men was watching me. he read a report on me - everything i said was quoted word by word.
my friend, i am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, i am finished.
unpack nothing.  i didn't say i was staying.
you're bullies!  cowards, both of you!
i love you. don't feel sick.
because - monster as i was - i was bound by laws.  the protocol of hell.  the box had to be opened to let me out.  the truly innocent were safe.  that's no longer true.  the shell of the beast has been fleshed.  what i was is out there, joey.  in your world.  unbound. unstoppable.
it's the freest land on earth.
don't say a .
hurt!  how?
never mind, just say it.
find something:  extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
you're a beautiful young girl... i can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
i've had enough of your insolence!  put him in my car.  i think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the acme factory.
listen, jo-jo. does this mean anything to you? joan gale's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
so did i tell ya?  huh?  nothing to worry about.
mr. castro.
what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? you don't think that was a dream, do you?
you're duty to what? the country you served doesn't exist anymore.
yeah, fuck it. if you think about it, it's all you can do really. you can't tell him it was us. go in braggin' and shit.
pull over.
sid ahmed.
i love you, conner.
ok.
yes.
exactly. you see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old russia. the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
all right then, we'll use your plan.
and i also happen to be a jets fan.
you wouldn't want me to dig up flynn's file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times, would you?
a-fuckin'-men!
you're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
no. you look so beautiful.
humperdinck. humperdinck! humperdinck!
got the number of the motel out on the old highway? bates, i think. 
that's me.
third measure, second beat starting on e.  flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  and fourth measure, fourth beat - d.  ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  do you have that?
yes.
superb.
what?
try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
i would do it again in a minute.
on the contrary -- this is tremendous.  i mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and i'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
no.
i don't let him.  he just loves to.
a sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
that's what i'm going to do.
... nothing.
funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
the man has friends. and they're not likely to forgive me if i testify against him.
don't you know i'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
i know, i know... focusing on one little thing.
what is it you want from me?  some plantation follies?  some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  you want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
more bang for the buck.
i'm sorry, mister mcmurphy, i count only eight.
as soon as i met him, you knew i'd say yes.  he makes julia real for me.
that very nice.
i'm with you, sweetie, but detective thomas j. doyle has a pat answer for that.
do it!
no, i think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
pleased to meet you, mr. dawson.
fuck him.  fuck murray.  john?  you know?  you tell him i said so. what does he fucking know?  he's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
in point of fact, it didn't.  but i'm convinced the theory is sound.
i've got roma.  then i've got moss...
"serial mom"?  wow!
i have a new client.
too bad.
i had 'em hid in the foreign section.
the numbers don't make sense, sir. his brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  one private is simply not worth a squad.  colonel anderson this one is.  he's worth a lot more than that.  which is why i'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
no. just that you need to hurt me with it. i've been where you've been.
but you've never figured out a way to win.
'and the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
thank you... i'm sorry you had to lie.  it must have been difficult.
they'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
what time is it?
yeah, it's me.
godammit, betty!... who's chloe?
nobody knew!
what alien environment?
that's quite a statement.
it's not your concern.  it's... business, that's all.
hi, tita.
thank you, miss boatwright.
let's see.
acid-chewer.
he got pretty burned at chappaquiddick.
oh, man.
god dammit, stifler!
want to take it back?
still, i wish i could remember.   but, i guess it doesn't matter anyway.  we know each other now, don't we?
no, i should stay calm.  like you say.  right, norman?  stay calm.
uh huh. yeah. forget it.
hey, just calm down, i'm giving the orders here-
you miss me?...
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
could i speak to you for a second, dad?
you know what i'm doing with my part of the gold?
oh!--dear god, i did not think it would be me to tell you. a great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
you don't look eighty.
so did i.
give me the radio.
is that your official response?
way i figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total b.s.  and our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
miss weathers.
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i'd just poured him. then i tried to deck the sucker.
you mentioned something called redstone.
agent desmond, would you hold the finger for me. there's something up there.
because i had too much pride.  too much integrity.  i wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  some material i refused to do.
don't be so glum, hawk. the night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
how many murders did you cover up? one? five? maybe an even ten.
i was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. for that, i'm sorry.
damn! where the hell is he? we should've found him by now.
yes.
it's not your time. i get time off.
no, dr. hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  they are science.  perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
i'm gonna go get the money.
he's over at st. james. they had to put two pins in his arm.
judy, i want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days i've had in a year.
what?
did you buy the horse, papa?
five-fifty-five. we'll be at the station in plenty of time...
taking pictures?  it's a long story. i'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
i'm for that.
any sign of the goddess barrington?
no. we ain't even...
other properties as well - here and in europe.  and vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. all yours now.
you wrote bill's scripts!  jesus christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
name's patrick, i met him at the driving range.
this isn't real.
insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people i put away with alternate futures?  my god, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
johnny... what's going on?  i don't get it... did i do something?
good evening, sir.
ah, how exciting! tell me more.
what?
i don't need this... you said tonight and now it's not tonight...
i'd slap his face.
tsch.
you're not fooling anyone you know.  isn't there anything you could do?
we certainly do.  vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  but right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, i take it?  you think i could interrupt her a moment, mr. bernstein?
hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
if only i had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
i was the world's sweetest ingenue.
i had another one of you guys down here from frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  what's this about anyway?
strong is vader.  clouded is your fate.  mind what you have learned ... notice everything, everything!  it can save you.
hey now, look!  let's all get on the same page here.  this shipment is do or die for zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  if we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  he's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  on the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  more old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
empty plot.  memorial stone.  vacant. they never did put her under.  cool, huh?
date?
you know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? he's just gonna call the cops again.
peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  it blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  scared the socks off some poor librarian.
you have beautiful things.  how much is this?
yeah, but i hardly noticed it. i'm more worried about the part where i have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
see, they should've picked him. look how comfortable he is out there.
he's on the island, he'll be back on...
when the enterprise-b beamed us off the lakul, we were partially in the nexus. the transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, i am like a mother tonight. i want a child.
georgetown.
is it true? is ignorance bliss?
i don't know. i guess.
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
the red dress?  no. my black one. then i'll be just like him.
you find him, tell him the dog got run over and i'm out of grocery money.
strickland.
no. sit down.
you know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
alchemy.
it is too! now you passed it!
knock it off will you, general?  crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
all right. okay. i'11 ... see you.
i need a vacation.
that's natchez-under-the-hill.
i agree with what you said...truly.
mr. kimball a bottle of san pelle-
i don't know...somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
"insane?" the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. the event horizon could be there in a day...
of what? they're both crooks.
it was all in czech wasn't it.
not at all, sir.  i have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
yeah, well it's fucking monday afternoon.  you should get out of bed earlier.
arnie, i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass.
and how about your co-star in nightmare i.  would you trust him alone with your child?
a... week?
you're making it too easy.
hello, alabama.
no, not yet.
fucken noddle's hanging off ..
yeah.
yes, i have seen that show on television.
yes... a man i know took me to switzerland last month...
oh. right.
naw, man. i just told you, i'm comfortable. i ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. you bring your ass out here.
get on. i'll take you to him.
ho's a good guy --
like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  fingers rotting off?
i don't want to live any more.
now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
he had the club out on the old trail road--
i'd just like to know your opinion of him. in general. just how dangerous is he?
what do you say, mr. nugent? you'll be doing me and my family a great service.
memory is no trick, it is a power. the power to see.
two.
oh, i don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  what's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  it's only money.  it doesn't mean anything. you're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
you are.  you're losing your mind.  what about walter?
ah, it's over!  elliot, i mean it. it's over!
darling, i was busy looking out for your interests.
can you recall any particular incident that relates to mr. kramer's care of his child?
you make it sound like i'm already dead.
you stumbled around. remember, you've got my id, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
i've heard some odd things about jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
is she ever. i've got some stories....
i doubt it.
...or from the cut on his hand. which is more probable?
well, this guy i've met runs a hotel. brother. loads of contacts. does a nice little sideline in punting british passports to foreigners. get you a good price.
ok...i'll wait.  for now. but i'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
every triangle i've ever seen never lasts.  somebody's got to go.
you touch my spleen, rollo.  and here all the time i was thinking -- if i ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's rollo. he's in vd and he's happy.
i hate to do this, fella.
"the blood tide".
therapist.
can't tie him. either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  reckon we could git him *drunk*?
you never had it.
man bones?
pressures on, eh proximo?  there's got to be a load of money in this. why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
before you do that, you might want to look at what i've been looking at.
why not?
no. exotic.
with us.
yes.
i'm here.
the terms will be mine.
shhhhhhh.  wait... wait...
what's that you say?
watched her come out of the apartment, someone i didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way i didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  golden gate park. five miles. she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the portals of the past. sat there a long time, not moving... and i had to leave, to got to the office. that evening, when i came home, i asked what she'd done all day. she said she'd driven to golden gate park and sat by the lake. that's all.
you're going to miss mexican halloween. the day of the dead.
no, baby, those are the hands of a killer
ah, macy.  why don't you help janet freshen up before rehearsal.
no.  do you?
huh?
we're down to a "couple" now, huh?
he served his time for what he did. another thing... if lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
i'm happy, miss flaemm.
sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
he ain't nothing like me. how come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? you ought to stop protecting him.
jesus, ann, get a life. i just asked what he looked like.
i could lead you right to him. you could take him back to hell instead of me.
is this a contract violation, mr. cobb?
i don't know. it looks familiar to me.
it's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
you want to go with me?
yeah, right... believe me, at this point i'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
no.
-- you thought what?
eight o'clock?
shit yeah, the achievers.
washington sent ya. i know that.
are you sure he's still alive?
hey guys.
that's right. as a matter of fact...
yeah?
really?
oh, you're welcome. nice to finally meet you, jeffrey.
i was talking to another friend of harry's. a baron kurtz - do you know him?
like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
uh-huh.
farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
you can't sing at the competition.
yeah!
do i know you?
a song a comin' i feel.
ya know, ever since i met you, my luck has been for crap.
do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
in a corridor.
i'm told you've asked for a bureau cross-check of flight records to and from el paso, ft. myers, omaha, the murman murder time frames.
with what?
in a way.
you did what?
except for small eyes.
i got it in the inaugural.  "thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
yes.
yes.
hell, no! i just got something in my eye.
how could i be?  we learned some magic...
huh?
i finally found my story.
i hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
leave her out of this.
that cop!  why'd you have to do that?  you couldn't wound him?  the guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
no.
it's focus.  every opponent has a weak spot.  you ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
it says, "records show that ellie thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the willows state mental facility."
we couldn't be on more solid ground.
i'm bored. i'm alone all day and i don't know what to do.
i don't know. but i gave it to you...to help you...not him.
yeah, the guy with the bmw i told you about. i did, didn't i?
i'm glad you like it.
how long have i been here?
maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
this is how you play god.
bill, rod, wait --
asshole probably got lost.
what secret meaning? like a satanical thing?
and what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
if she identifies him.  where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  venza was meat.  he walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  you better hope she identifies him.
couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  and did you catch a whiff of their breath?!  it's like having a conversation with a couple of onions!  not to mention...
hello, sam, this is dr. marcia fieldstone on network america.
it doesn't make any sense.  it paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
but, al, it's the bunk! norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day i met him! why buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
you don't act like the rest of gideon's friends. they believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
hm? yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
shall we mingle?
that might not be so bad... at least for you.
should i hit it?
yeah, long time ago.  i know you?
who was it answered the phone?
what's the surprise?
you don't know her? judy? works in the slaughterhouse.
how the hell did you get into the building?
you know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
some people do it for the money
no...actually, i'm a documentary filmmaker?
i don't give a fuck what you are.  i asked you --
--and we brought it back with us!
they must've hit something.
not at all.  when i was a boy back on the farm i used to pump my own water.
but...i...400 years?
let's see!
sit, creasy. everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  really. you won't find a better carne asada in all of mexico.
what?!  now hold on!  wait one damn minute!
... he ought to put him in here.
my job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  i wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
no.
hey kid, it's me, bill munny.
for her, they might make an exception.  if not, i'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
i didn't check my messages...
what the--
what. a. martyr. understand; martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
but you can breathe it.
then why did they try and sneak in the back door? tell me that. why didn't they contact us first and say...
i'm fine.  my dad said you tore your acl.
there are no experts. you probably know as much about possession than most priests. look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as i have, you'd know it's like saying you're napoleon bonaparte. you ask me what i think is best for your daughter. six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
you know what we're going to do after dinner?
come on, shelly.  who else is gonna give him a lift?
oh, that's all right, stew. forget it. as far as she's concerned, i'm just part of the hired help.
that's the problem with this case. everyone thinks they know jason's life story. but they don't. what you're remembering is a _movie_. fiction.	in the movie, jason's mother runs around, killing people after jason drowns in crystal lake
no.
they must've just missed me.
tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
two.  squeeze harder.
why did you do this?
look, miss, i don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
thanks. so...  what do you want to do?
the least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
ain’t nobody out there, mister.
it's . . . it's locked.
what she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. she's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
that's okay.  listen, give me your hand.
comfortable?
well, what happened to you?
will we ever be in war?
comrade.
don't eyeball your kids.
i didn't say that.  i mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. people say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  it's like they call it off, going "i was wrong."
i don't understand this... i don't understand this one bit. he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. somethin' bad has happened - i jus know it.
hetero.
i don't know her.. or particularly want to.
...how novel.
allright. calm down.
that's right.
well, i was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. it's in the xeno galaxy. or it was. it was called krypton. that's k-r-y-p...
...find him on the...frank. his name's frank mackey --
it's his way.
a "t."
...and i'm going to get bounced and you're...
you're fools, both of you! it's obvious they're out to crucify norville! they're trying to destroy him!
would you like to stay for dinner?  there aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. so would i.
yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
for ever and ever.
you should be dead.  how do you feel?
mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. he wanted to know where she was.
you've got it, master.
and when those dirty yanks go to sleep --  no offense.
you're foreigners.
what you talking?
since when?
are we done now? you've got nothing on me. so if you ain't booking me, i'm walking.
i suppose we might catch them off their guard.
oh, yeah?
david lee morgan. my dog's name is sounder.  that feels better.
you're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
all right, let's forget about them for the time being. what about your weed man?
i don't know. it doesn't matter. the thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
my version of "take this job and shove it..."
i beg your pardon?
do you have it?!
you're walking around blind without a cane, sport. a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
they asked me to help.
really...?  your family there...?
leave her out of this!
warm and friendly and intelligent--  you know -- he's the only real friend i've made since i've been here.
reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
...and i don't think i'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
this is my way of telling you --
yes, but that was some ten months ago. i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
holy shit, dulli.  what the hell are you doing here?
yes.  i see your point.
i'm likin' you guys better
they only took electrical appliances.
you don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
until we're out of the mine field is how long.
i just joined up.  but i'm quitting! i got a trial membership!
i didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
but, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. you come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
get out of here!
look, he's in pretty good shape.
i know, i know ...!
what happened to it?
even with lifts i'm never that tall.
do you always look at it encoded?
so you're monumentally busy?
you're going to return every cent of it!
caesar, this is corky.  corky, caesar.
we want that money -- now!
tired of this shit...
it’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  you did the right thing.
must have a sweet tooth. see if you can find some cookies.
me like.
francis. you gonna leave the seeds in there? in the binding like that?
handsome, thirties, psychologist...
jesus all right enough!
no. you've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
i don't know how to translate that.  e difficile... il signor ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
hmm, i should feel right at home with them...
this isn't reality. this is fantasy.
turn on your radio!
look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, i've got to know.
thanks again.  i 'm glad you waited.
then why bother curing me?
remember our friend healy? well, i didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so i sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. turns out there is no diabetic mom. landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
something the matter?
she just took her hair down.  now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  you better get that ice.
just tell me who did it and i'll go get him, baby.
i don't think so.  you should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
chuck, hello.  this is agent kulok. she has a background in medical forensics.
i ... nothing.  i just stubbed my toe on a rock.  hurt like hell.
diz--
charles is right behind me.
lucky kid.
i'm not that crazy.
says you were a bully...
and we got rid of the red head.
guess.
you don't look a day over one hundred and five, captain. what's your secret?
beautiful view, isn't it?
i'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
well, the idea's right, anyway. are you going to call me?
well, i can't. ... i mean...i'm trying to.  i can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that i'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
i packed it. just for us.
just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and rudy vallee.
it makes perfect sense.  field work is not our oeuvre.
i won't.  now just relax. where are you?  yeah, i know it...on pico. are you alright?
i know! he killed kincaid!
you shut up!  they're beautiful, but get them some water.
nooo.  this way the rotation stays the same.
i am. and i'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
but we who are still free will do all we can. we are organized, monsieur, underground like everywhere else. tomorrow night there is a meeting at the caverne du bois. if you would come...
i always wear gloves when i shoot people.  a bad joke--but better than tears.
call me mark, would you?  cause i'm gonna keep calling you sidney.
if you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. give my love to mama- tell her i'll see her thursday.
juno just wanted a closer look at kimber here.
agents who died in the field.
"the fault, dear david, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
why don't you go to see julia? she handles his money.
some crank.  looking for goat hooves.  come up with anything?
my god.
it doesn't matter how.  i was driving a stolen car--
i'm trying to, sir.
it's okay. they're prescription.  works better with a little whiskey.
no. the kind from kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
no, walter!  i said i thought she kidnapped herself!  you're the one who's so fucking certain--
... but dick, he's looking for two years in tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. he's a good man.  he's only trying to do what's right.
i do.  your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where i was.
i recognize him now.  is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
'ola!
then i won't bring you....
i could come for a second opinion?
this one.
yeah.
oh, you know - junior league - charity bazaars - i used to sell kisses for the milk fund.
let her speak.
sure.  i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. right above your left ear.
jesus christ, joe. fuckin' forget it. this is beneath me. i'm mr. pink, let's move on.
doolittle, are you there?
yeah, i know.
so, vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  a tough guy.
what stuff?
be still my crotch.
mr. jung, do you know diego delgado?
commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
you're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  it wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause i ain't afraid of shit. you think i'm afraid for you to stay here. you're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. not really, i'm just jokin' with you. welcome to our humble home, buddy. frank needs all the friends he can get. frank's a real weak little kid. his daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
i have waited forever for this. you will not cheapen it, little boy.
how do you do, mr. mccord. we're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a ms. betty...
gale, your engine's still running.
mary had a little lamb.
oh, my sweet, beautiful lotte.
it's a place called shaw's siesta motel.  the address is 1921 north east 23.  it's under your name.
i'm sorry. detective morelos.
yes.
i'm so glad.
out in back.
according to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
no.  but if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
now get this, conroy. my name is smith. always was smith - and always gonna be smith.
no me mate.
not if you don't grow up...
it was more in passing.
cancer.
i'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
hello, how are you?
that's what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
yes, i am confident that juan obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  but, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  we get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
ted, i'm leaving you.
yeah. but get outta here. he's comin' back.
nobody asked you to.
i'm going to quit.  that's what has to happen first.  then we're going to tell him.
what do you want me to do?
sort of.
caviat emptor, mother. let the buyer beware.
i need help? whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, graham? not me, buddy. you're the fucking nut. now show me those tapes.
that's smart.
she's as american as apple pie too. have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
oh, you know how parties are. always some damage.
i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
but isn't fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
you look as if you could.
i don't think you know what you're talking about.
go on.
that's good, memories are good sweetheart. vada, i'm sorry; i was trying to keep it from you, i just couldn't. you're a good girl, and i want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  seeya in the morning.
look. i'm sorry. just let me leave.
no sense messing up the streets.
who's the hostage, sayer, her or you?  you look kind of "captive" yourself.  while you're spending every waking hour obsessing over simone, guess what, i guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  get off my property or i'll call the cops.
delbert grady.
i didn't have much to do with it.
to the city.
-- sacha, call a cab.
monster. there never was a structure change. this place was built the same from day one.
what's going on, colonel?
you think you could do better "laredo?"
forgery? fraud?
i just wanted to get past this &quot;old school marm&quot; image.
i would imagine that we are, now. i think i'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
ain't that something?
said.
gee, i wonder why not.
good looking?
m-o-n-y -- i'm right! that's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. m-o-n-y.
and on monday, i'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
trust is something you earn, over time. you don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
yeah -- he really dug his playboy mag, man -- i mean like he was there when it arrived -- he just knew.
me first!
right, the gym.
she doesn't know what we're up to. and we can't afford to let her find out.
gee, um...  i...i don't know what to say.
on what?
of course you can stay. this belongs to the people.
because i want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  i want you more now than i did that first night--  you've forgotten all that, i suppose?
there are cops all over the place.
now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. i got them set just the way i want 'em.
what?
pete... don't...
i get the point, kiddo. but i'm not so bad, am i?
don't take anything.
no, it's not. paulie is virile, by the way. he was very good in... chair.
it would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
it's from hunger.
we don't know nuthin' else.
the way what is going to be?
easy night. bachelor party. can we give wendy a ride?
through the closet.
we have the codes here.  how do you want to receive them?
take the car.  get outta here, tommy.
yes.
good, yeah, it is a rose. only this one is rather atypically made from 100% pinot noir.
whoa, thanks, man.  these are cool. they'll be collector's items.
why yes.  i met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
at least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
sir, i have a couple of extra circuits.  perhaps they might bring something.
i recommend her majesty uses the covered carriage with a full horse guard.  in the event of any disturbance i will ensure --
no.
why are all these people after me?
die tomorrow or die today.
did he tell you how we finally met?
well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  i like to know where he goes, but at the same time i don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
no?
yes.
my mother took this course with you at ucla...&quot;the foundations of poetic thought&quot;.
dave.
what bag?
okay, okay.  you'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
yeah ... betty. you don't rush it. i don't rush it. we play it close, just like in the movies.
i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
for. . . ?
mr. sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
your boss, number two, i understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
just a shotgun, huh? better let me take a look at that.
maybe what?
i was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. i was originally brought in as a technical advisor. first bank had sponsored my scholarships.
i never lied.  i may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
if the french army had been commanded at jena and auerstadt by a tailor, the king of prussia would certainly have gained the day.
there was a count.  count dusan.  he would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
i'm no pusher, betsy. honest. i never have pushed.
joanne bourne.
look, they need a machine to fly.
what...
no.
send them, damn it!  i know, but i'm not gonna be held responsible --
right. but gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. have to be careful who we pick.
so if i let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
oh, no, i'm fine...fine.
my own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
kenny. camera. now.
and --?
sometimes.
her name is pamela isley.  i saw her talking to gordon.  she must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
marry me instead.
it was a payoff and an insult.  ingen never--
what is that he's working on?
i see.
spanish.
it is buried somewhere in the grudd mountains.
i'll take you up on that.
never take up poker, detective.
you from around here?
you following me?
who says so?
you just need some sleep, lou.  it won't look so bad when...
yeah.  old times.
i've got the clients.  i've got the juice.
i didn't come here to drink scotch.
i trust you of course i do but --
if you came back.
i'm not thirsty.
i don't...
yes. say hello to col --
how old are you?
when - you're a big boy.  i mean you know it's bad for you
yes.  in about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with dreiberg.
i know. so am i, right? and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service. he's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of southwestern university -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  i think it's only fair to warn you: i'm going to file an action, miles. and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
remember, skiers stay up longer.
i can't tell you that.
... okay... you made your point.
that's too bad.
it's okay, baby, the police are coming.
i don't think so.
i'd want to set out events as they happened.  the way i see it is this: the british empire was an ideal.  it may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what i think the conservatives were trying to do.  then there's the essential--
i had gotten their trust. we were sharing fantasies. i couldn't risk it.
now that's romantic.  a proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? what went wrong?
your father?
i think he nearly ruptured his truss.
go?
hope you never do. at first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
oh my god, angie crick? from english class?
thanks, valentine ...
have we met?
you set me up from the beginning. it was you that got julius killed.
i wasn't trying --
she's... sick.  actually she never had mai tais before.
look!  scar?...  do you know where he went? and if he has a girl with him...a <u>white</u> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
you... think... i... stole... your... fancy shoes? i... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
forget it, sonny.  they're gone.
thank you. can i see her?
you ain't dying, he is.
this is a tough place to keep kosher.
i know this ain't easy, lula, but i ain't gonna let things get no worse, i promise.
i don't even know what this is. this sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
it's perfect, you've done a great job.
not me, sonny. i'm just going to sit around and listen.  what's this?
two years. ever since we left island.
what?
it wasn't like that.
well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  ain't gonna be much use, though.  lines are dead.
it's a big part of the show.
and absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. do we have that in common, captain?
i understand you joined up in bremen.
aren't we all, mrs. peel?
only at the very end.
they ruined me tonight.
i just don't understand.  you would think someone ... anyone ...
i'm -- i'm fine.
not you.
just be glad you're all right.
yes.
good! snipers can't be in position.
our lives are more important. anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
bob?
did you get him?
i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
absolutely not.
jason?! where is he?!
i can't be certain that you would. but what have you got to lose?
no.
are you kidding me? what's to like?
ball park sausages.
oral hygiene?
don't let up, childs!
the acid bath?
taylor's dead.
i need a dealer.
yes. ceiling. why did you run away?
looks clear.
the "other place," what is that...?
i'm sure we could find a date for your team. why don't i take it up with henry?  thanks for the drink, boys.
hi.  would you mind slowing down?
what're you talkin' about?
you're not?
a serum test possibly.
not if i shoot first!
i like you, dil
you cut yourself outside, miss?
then it's going to happen.  the world's going to end.  -- and you've always known.
will you watch it and see for yourself?
kiss me.
how was the beach?
those two musicians from the garage!
we can still come out of this okay. pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. that's the story.
seafood salad.  you ever operate a jet ski?
it's in the area of narcotics, mr. reynard, that the government tramples on the fourth amendment.
he needed money?  for the operation for you?
oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
yeah.  nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
don't play dumb with me, mickey. you know what i mean. describe mallory.  what's up here?  what's in here?
days... maybe hours... protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  i'm sorry.
no.  you will not run me out.  no one will believe a word of what you say.
naturally.
look, i don't know what this...
where is she now? is she in the truck with your friends?
i'm ready to communicate with you now.
um... he was older.
rose, darlin', you break my heart. but i am only a human man myself of the father variety. rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
i've took as much of you as any man can
sleep.
we never really shared one.
look. those kids are still trick-or- treating. they're still out.
i just got back -- i don't know which end is up.
eleven thirty - jesus!
was i ever of use?
if i spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
maybe i can help you find him. i know a			* lot of people.
saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  god didn't make it that way.  we did.  we make the world -- in our own image.  what else can i illuminate?
wait a minute--jim--you didn't ask *smith* over here!
do you wanna give me a minute?
why do you like to fight so much?
my eyes are lighter.
gimme that damn thing.
i'll call you later.
guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
they'll be up there in a half hour.
oh, just a day--
naturally i am, sir.
the senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
then skip it, man. but you slipping, baby. you done slipped.
what am i, a goddamn postman?  i'm way the fuck up here, i'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  put a stamp on it for chrissake!
everything interests me.
but he's a policeman --
i've got another one.  warmer.  what will you do when it's all over?
so she tells me three times a week.
we're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
first place, you started it with the french over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the ohio.  now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
fixing a leak under your sink.
we've been ordered to -
peppinoooo! come back sooon!!  good thing germany's closer than russia.
why, lois, i didn't know . . . who is he?
well, we didn't know that at the time.
terrorist.  radical agitator.  stool pigeon.
so all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
no, i mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be your goals... whose dreams seem to be your dreams?
of course. what happened to your face?
unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
it was an earthquake and it was dark.  i have no idea.
n-no...i mean...you bet.
so what?
you win.
i can...make it work.
so let's talk.
she does, vince! that's what i'm telling you! she does!!!
what?
all right, i'm leaving.  i'm sorry ma'am.
fuck!
oh.
hide the gun.  throw it away. anything.  listen, i gotta borrow your car...i think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what i mean?
that, and... i'll be done in a minute.
do you recall my instructions to you, starling? what were they?
soon. first, i must bless this house.
i don't think so.
oh, that's <u>great</u>.  let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
mrs. macdougall, i think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
who?
how did i look?
it's something we're all intimately involved in: the reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
shut up.
well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
alright, i'm worried about christmas. i wish i hadn't told him i'd be back ..
jazz.
in manhattan?
it's not a plan. it's just --
look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. okay?  we're gonna be in some deep shit here.  working the danger zone. and you need insurance.  cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
yes to me or yes to the coil?
i'm not scared of ralph lauren. those are <u>sheets</u>.  are you gross under there?  are you <u>night of the</u> <u>living dead</u> under there?  like all bloody veins and pus?
oh... a lot of things. several different factors. will you see her, doctor mumford?
i was going to say dimensions. but i guess technically they are dreams.
george --
you're too late.  there was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  but he turned to dust and blew away.  i don't have any power for you to take.
you're not. merely direct. what were you doing there? at old fort point?
i would thou hadst my bones, and i thy news: i pray thee, speak.
i know what i see.
what's that supposed to mean?
huh uh.
business keeps you on the road?
so am i.
he alive to see this?
what do you know, they moved it. catch you later.
we have nothing on him, ambassador skrapinov.
i'll get home all right now.
yeah. it missed the last four stops.
i say we tape him to a chair.
and he's fine, girl.
for a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
he said if i gave in to you i'd start losing again.
we can stop him.
um...soon tonight...i think, yes? tommorrow...i mean...very soon...very...
good to see ya.  william would you...
he notices.
certainly.
maybe.  maybe not.
don't you?
hard to find doors in this place.
my god, i am going to have another breakdown. god, god.
i'll be there.  the danburrys.  friday night.  thank you, chris.
you didn't come here to tell me this. you have the letters of transit. you can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. why are you interested in what happens to laszlo?
you were in the room. it was your purview. it was your job to make sure bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. you've got the most important job in the world right now. you're the smartest guy the president has.  besides me.
nightmare.
we've come a long way since world war ii, major.  and the lessons we've learned are all in plan-r.
pop, this is important to me.  it's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
what i'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
hey, man, at least in study hail i could meditate.
like freddy.
nobody's going to do that!
i want it to be over for me too. i feel like i slipped over some invisible line, that i'm in your world now.  everything's the same, but i see it differently. it's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
i'm afraid so, mister presient. being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
i... i thought it was great. i loved it. it was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
yesssss. yes. yes. yes.
when does frederick ever come with her?
i'm not going to get up an' leave you.  now let's go over to el's an' have a good time.
better. very much better. i'd like something to wear. and some cigarettes. will you bring me some?
oh yeah?
that, and your thing.						   *
a.p.b.... he isn't breaking any law.  he's a grown man... he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that's what he wants to do.
and you think i'm sick?
yeah. i'm extremely worried about that. it's right up there with global warming.
oh, i'm very grateful.
what the fuck you doin'?!
oh, it'll be fine, i'm sure, claudia.
you didn't marry him for love.
between ten and twelve. once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. i always asked how old they were.
yeah...
one thing i'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to liddy, how did that work?
well, i'm sorry.
guess so.
all the time.
fine.
daddy, *please*...
oh, who cares?
you really suck, you know that?
no one would ever have to know its not him.
i don't get you.
but it's all you do.
yeah yeah, i know the fucking show walter, so what?
pee...per...man.
mm. hey, what are you doing now?
what's that?
try, kelly.
it's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
go downstairs, i will help you.
automatic.
you'll work it out, scotty. and remember: two of them.
no, not for sure. when it comes, it comes. you gonna want some shit?
i've got to feed my cat.  besides, i want to get to bed early.
barry, i'm fucking broke!  i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
the lord be with you.
where do you eat?
i've got the forensics fella coming down from the rangers. no way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
you know what he mean, dude.
i think i'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
he tried to kill me!
i apologize, sir, i'm having a bad day...
it's hairy ,though. that's where we lost mcdonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. it's charlie's point.
he's on the list.
not exactly, sir.  you see, colonel puntrich at air command hq received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  he asked general ripper if he had issued the go-code and the attack order, and general ripper said:  "sure, the orders came from me.  they're on their way in, and i advise you to get the rest of air command in after them. my boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  then he hung up.
i think so.
yes.
it was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
you--you gotta get us out of here.
thank you for being kind enough to lie. you see, i've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. you're hired. any questions?
i've got to leave malkovich.
do you expect me to believe that?
one-four degrees...
what do you think happened?
we're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
in a minute. get us a table.
i listened extremely carefully. nothing was even vaguely implied. he even laughed in your face when you asked him
mary beth! this has never been anything but --
my little sanctum is at your disposal. but i don't think i understand -
that's alright.  we'll take it from here.
if i had one, evelyn, i think you know who'd be first and last --
oh, no.  she tells this story at every major holiday.
and i'll give then proof!
i'm sorry.
will?
mmm... i love it when you talk like that.
okay, let's see. how long were you in the camp for?
<u>dr. acula</u>!
see that?  who needs affection when i've got blind hatred?
1995?
now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
you ordered all members of the royal family to attend you at balmoral.
thank you, eve.
eh, mickey, it's getting late.
oh, i think we're going to have several.
is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
you'll be missed.
hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  players couldn't get a drink.
the same.
no!
eight?
yes, and just one time can be enough.  thank you.
and this - if you decide to take the rest.
girlfriend?
ours!
i look horrible.
we have to find magneto.
people have been crucified before.
that's not an answer.  what is it you want?
nick tatopoulos.
c'mon.  it'll be great.
have they said anything about our area?
well, there's some fellows fishing at pine summit might be interested.  they probably saw it come down.  i'll let 'em know...what's it look like?
sorry. it's a pretty name, though. it means "merciful", right?
that's okay...
santa rosa?
one.
you said speak czech!
but times were different then. i was a man at that age. the master of a large plantation just south of new orleans...
nigh on ten years.  been through a lotta scrapes together.
is what you?
for the last time, i don't want it cleaned. now get the hell out of here!
not the window - i can't bear the light anyway - no, i can see all the way to the desert.  i've found the lost fossils.
shut up and open the door.
really?  and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
okay.  i'll do it.
don't get smart with me, son.
no, i usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
what do i want with a scar ?
you like it? i'll send you a box.
yes.  absolutely.
my boat's neat, dad!
something must've happened! what set him off?
what's it to ya?
goodbye.
how you doin'?
it's just that -- well, i'm honored that you selected me, and everything, i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
yeah, well, that's enough.
long enough.
why not?
i mean...
it's just the wrench, grace. it's for their sake.
well perhaps better than my first. 
mmm, that's a good one.  maybe his echo...  okay, no more stalling.
sure was.
tom.
excuse me for asking.
i've got to get to her....
just make sure it looks like an accident...
reasonable? good, i'd like to meet a reasonable man. why don't you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner?
off a high-powered paraski that was trying to kill me.
they're doctors?
i am concentrating. where can we rule?
it's all right, i forgive you. i'm not the vengeful type. we'll forget what happened. why don't we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas.
henry hill.
miss johnson is a teacher, and...
i'm afraid not.  i can't make it tonight.
he just doesn't talk a lot.
what?
whoa!
yes.
maybe they just want to appeal.
when you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  but then she met peter and skipped the idea of renting.
walter, i'd love to --
i bet your parents were happy to pay.
i want you here.
don't even start, old man.
don't flatter yourself.  i always liked that line.
alonzo?  what are you talking about?  where are you...?
please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
i -- what are you?!
and by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
some of it good, i hope.
no offense, kent. you're good, but lois is the best we've got.
no, but if i get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
you're insane. you've lost your mind.
any of us?
is he cool or angry?
that's too bad.  i would rather have him at home--to see what i'm going to do.
okay, let's heat 'em up!
what do you have in the house?
it's not your fault.
over there.
i am arthur, king of the britons.
to sound like big macho cops. he was probably just found with a knife in his back.
all right.
should we close down any eruption?
yep.  could save yourself a lot of trouble. her name's alice for sure.
just a second. it's my ass i'm risking. you better do it my way. these fuckers don't mess around.
what's with you?
three lousy zlotys. and there are people here making millions.
landon. i can't even do for myself.
we've repeated.  a few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
where's warner?
no, that's quite all right.
we'll know in forty seconds.  only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
you have a real gratitude problem. you know that, bruce? i need a name. batboy? the dark earl? what's a good side kick name?
i never paid for it in my life.
with what just happened upstairs --
you don't have to wait three days...
what?  beth?  my beth?
me too.
but the time is now. soon others will come.
the worst?
no. you can be mine!
i thought you'd never ask.
okay, brother.
hm...
you were just a kid.
i took a cab.
i don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
i'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
do i hear a woman's voice?
it's not a request.  i need to know what white knows.  follow him or i'll have you pulled off 'badge of honor.'  permanently.
wouldn't surprise me none.  wicker man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... that'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. you in or out?
she didn't tell you why she was upset?
i don't know, honey.  i guess it would depend.
such as what?
no, not that bad. it was a fella that sends you flowers every day. er, what's his name? mr. norton's nephew.
i also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
hey, you, secret service man, what are you --
let's waste him.  no offense.
oh, i hope so, dear.
i see you've done your homework. [beat] alpine grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. at the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [beat] now, we do. and things are different.
oh -- oh!
yes. i had thought that... i was loathsome to you. perhaps i am. if i may be excused, m'lord.
the point... 
there are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
paulie!
i've had a drink.  fatal.
it's so exciting. new york. the mad forward thrust of everything. my sense of time here is completely altered.
dr. malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
not spar, i'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting creed for the championship.
well, it's kinda a strange time right now. things are kinda -
oh, and my pace is more librarians.
saw something i didn't like.
i notified everybody! nobody listened.
martha... what?
okay, i'm going, i'm going. jesus...
wait!  i hear her breathing now. there, she just picked it up again.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
hello.
what are you talking about? where are you?
i'll show you! i'll show you!
thank god. i could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
yeah.
what?  i improved her a little...
alright, let's take a vote...
great place huh?
yep.  have a good time at school, ray.  wish me luck.
that's a texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
i know all the kids coming up. got to stay ahead of the game. but i don't know you.
hm.
this is my wedding.
i don't know what he was, but he made frankenstein look like a lily!
j.j., steve isn't...
pleased to meet you.
open it.
why cancoon?
i've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  but i'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
answer what?
in return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, i'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that i stay interested.
why do you think i keep her here?
no, i mean - about my client.
in other words, our scope is too narrow.
three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. see, i gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
well, if you will excuse me.  madame. what a pleasure.
i missed you at the funeral home. santos said you were here.
to what?
yeah.  i guess.
you do?
because "dr. grant" isn't looking for eric. dr. grant is looking for the coast.
i'll never run again.  i promise.
that's a nice name.
but wait...
no, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, i just stay at the four seasons. it's easier.
you mean confirmed, mother. i didn't confirm it before. i would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
come on.
in the car.
twenty months?
i sent them home. go and call them.
there you go.
joe!
miss wollsten!
same old daniel.
if it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. see you later.
you don't wanna know.
well, i'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
yeah -- and lednov's only lookin' for one man. me.
nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
it suits you.
hey man.
jezzie! my feet are throbbing!
what rate?
you're so witty.  i'm so jealous... i <u>need</u> to get out of here, jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
they were kidding you.
i can paint anywhere.
me?? c'mon --
nobody saw. but i don't think so.
is she injured?
heather.
come on, don't you screw with her, please!  you... you got to want this: armored car job.  caltrust bank. they took two million in cash...
don't you think i know that?  but what are you judging by?  bucharest??? this was always a hick town.  they can't get a 'bus and truck' company to come in here.  are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
no.  no.  go around.  keep going...
i like harry, but i can't deny he sweats a little.
something like that.
could be.  do you play the market?
hi.
over the water department, or over you?
you do?
good. it might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... robert... is there any improvement...?
see, i've got bills.  my mother's been dying of the same disease since i was a kid.
i talked to him gordo.  i talked to my dad.
a bunch of real mama's girls.
you should. it's wonderful.
except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up --
i don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
it's this health farm. a bit out of the town. isolated. it's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. the place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
you are ill.
exactly. woah.
egon and i have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in gevs - giga electron volts.
not quite.
i like it up here.
you scared me.
no, ma'am. no way. there's girls on the rubber rose who are political, but i don't share their views. i got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
no.  i shall be out walking.
what engagement present?
i was?  how you spell that?
yes, sir.
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  from the gitgo, from jump street.
in the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
later.
if it must be.  yes.
in eye of that painting.
no.  i'm missing the game for you.
get him out of there!
i shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
it shouldn't be any harder than general motors was. but now...this is what i get for using humans.
why?
dell -- show me that on a screen.
without what?
dorkatops!
she can't get a job, it's a depression. and we can't just throw her out on the street.
what?!
don't change the subject! i want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
nice drawing. did you do that?
if that's the way you want it.
perhaps... perhaps... i'm afraid i must first ask you to pass a test. i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
yes.
that's your name, isn't it?
i told you i was gonna hit you.
sorry, i was seven at the time.
nooo!!
have you looked?
okay. see you later.
just a little queasy...
you think that's wise?
the basic principles of time travel are there.  so you have the vessel and the portal. and the vessel can be anything. most likely a spacecraft.
i was willing to shoot captain renault, and i'm willing to shoot you.
i wouldn't worry if i were you. of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. so don't worry. leave everything to me.
i thought you were my mother.
it looks like he's writing everything down.
it was a mistake, i never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now i love someone else.
yeah.
that's what i would have done.
at least i haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
we're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. if it turns ugly, the russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
no, it's for the best, it really is.  we were so wrong for each other.
let me try.
what has artie to do with it.
you've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? yeah, it was.
does everyone in the world know more than me?  jesus, i'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....lifted a piece of licorice when i was one and a half.  who knew it would lead... they even got the cia involved!
yes sir.
david --
-- what he would do to your dad's department? you gotta let me finish it --
i can’t tell you...  alright, alright! but you must protect me!
thanks. nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. oh, it's been a lot of fun.
sure! i was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls i know.
oh christ!
<u>do</u> you.  what does that mean?
this is really awkward...
yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. it only works if you're on good terms.
my name's 
anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
fine, quincy.
who are these ruffians?... i've never seen them before in my life! ... 
yeah.
no!  no different!  the differences are in your mind.  throw them out! no longer of use are they to you.
just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
so you're like... struggling superheroes?
a pin, neighbor stone! i'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
it's that easy?
it is?
don't call me that, please.
forensics people are sure of it. you have any idea who might have put him there?
and i don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman nung river. you say you don't know kurtz?
from when? you left vegas with four- fifty?
remember one thing.
i don't feel well.
it would be my child.
you are?
who pays for them?
for what?
why can't i -- ?  what the hell is going on here?
i did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
if casanova suddenly ... turned out to be romeo ... having supper with juliet--who might become cleopatra ... how would you start?
oh shit, thelma!!  shit!  shit! shit!
i know. i was there. i saw the whole thing.  if i was your therapist, i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
thanks for the information. appreciate it.
because that's what i would have done...
no -- the only thing i did for him was to keep track of the man named worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
we just take it?
you're being stupid.
oh, i see,  right.
and it's this place. it makes no sense, but it spooks me.
don't worry about dr. dreyfuss -- i happen to know he was out on a case.
she's a cacophony of contradictions.
hold on. i said hold on, so hold on.
subtle, isn't he? hey creep!
eighteen? why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
how much time is left?
um-mmm. oh nathan, this salad is delish...
... that this is all my fault?
what's that?
your honor, i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. and the dust, which counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. each time it has been examined and the results...
i think someone's watching.
why? you wanna have sex or something?
james, you said he was hiding in the barn...
couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
doesn't mean it's a signal.  could just be the hard drive heating up.
i ain't his partner, i'm a tourist.  i got proof.  see, i got a mini-bar key.
you went to those brain butchers?!
patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
do you favor its publication?
i understand.
don't push me, duff.
but why would she -- ?
herb. <u>i have to go</u>.
sounds all right.
don't say anything about this to my mother....
sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
not for me! betty! betty!
ben schwarz.
yeah, i meet a lotta jerks, too.
what time is it?
maybe.  what's this about?
don't touch it! get back in that tub!
when did you decide?
i'd have liked to talk to him.
what do you mean you know?  he told you he was gonna propose to me?
forget it, carmen. the mobile infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
what car?
i have no life. my brother johnny took my life from me.
who are they, sir?
oh please.
well, what is your definition of following?
not at all, if it can help.
she's good.
sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
look, reese, i didn't ask for this honor and i don't want it. any of it.
you have a lieutenant here...
two hundred years old.
it's not that kind of date.
will you just relax, mon? he's not gonna kill us. my father is a television repairman. he's got all kinds of tools. i can fix-this car.
i'm with the band.  i'm the lead singer.
you are good to me sam.
try what?
what 'you signifyin'?
risa, i serviced that bus.  at the garage.  there's nothing wrong with it.
pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
tails.  that's ridiculous.
you've turned her into you.  and i may not get another chance.  to turn her back.
go back to the car and keep brian there. i don't want him in here...  do it adele... now!
where's jones?
oh, i see... that must be a great burden.
nothing.  the bio buster?  i don't get it...
yes! yes! i was thinking that, too. no. i was feeling it. all i needed was to hear you say it! amen! i'll help them.
what's it like?
i'm really glad you think so.
i've seen the way he looks at you. he's always wanted you.  maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
this way, daphne.
huh?  oh, come on, sis.  i'm tellin' ya, we can't play clue with just two people.
what is the five grand?  what is the, you said that we were going to split five...
well, well!
what about me?
and the rest of us are truck horses?
does dorothy know her husband is dead?
care to join me?
the drugstore?
i am certainly glad to hear it. i know he'll be pleased.
yes, i know. a week's gone by and we haven't got the power of attorney yet!
twenty bucks.
i came over to see you.  i brought something...i wanted to show you.
you've gotta get her out of your head, man.
mm. you know, does he tell you about how, uh, jeff, pony, started the band...?
sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. but nothing less, either...
the son of skywalker.  you must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
no.
"you'll be burned out/or smoked out/an' come back to me, i know..."
no, a major, were you really?
he's a selfish bastard.
i have heard that story but i do not believe it.
no.
no.  but why do you let butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
maybe you better hear what i got to say first.
i gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
honest to god, emmett, he would've killed me.
dude, listen, man. i'm cool. how much for the treatment?
man, i wanna smoke a joint.
she's got us.  now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in perfection.
what will they be made of?
i want to talk to you about something, and i don't want to be disturbed.
yeah.
sure.  come on in.  i was just packing.
no. things are too hot. later. i'll send for you.
we put him away where he can do you no harm. you see we are looking after your interests. we are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. we shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
shhh!
look... i'd like to get back to lisca bianca.
you have to lay it on the table.
do you know what i gave up to be with you?
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again.
i'm cool.  i'm cool.
crime was rampant. it wasn't safe to stay in your home.
there's only one worth noticing.
not a tiny little vial -
when i find out who that phony bitch was.
that's a laugh.  if i don't ask, at least i won't be disobeying him.
i don't believe it.  do you?
i am not sure.  the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
you pushed me...
we've got to fix this.
yes! yes! let's get on with it.
okay.
well... yes.
could you tell us a little about it?
you can't do it.
ben asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians.
you steal a car?
came here to fire you, jerry.
outfit? what's he talking about?
okay?
i'm talking about salt.  oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. that's what picnics are for.
come on, jack.  it's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  it'll be like when we were kids.  relax.  enjoy the view.
-- general handyman, yeah.  i do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  i do housesitting while the owners are away.  in fact, that's why i've been in the area.  i've been living very close by.  here's the part that's giving you trouble, but i won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
we are always going to be all right tomorrow. i'd like to be all right a few todays.
mr. ola's just leaving, kay. please tell the senator i won't be a minute.
what did i say?
you have a dog? what kind?
not true.  besides, jack's the romantic.
terry!
exactly.  gregor, he was the russian's man.  it was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the russians who had the capital to finance it.  gregor, he was their insurance, and i was ours. everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  gregor must've got to swede...
not too late.
fuck.
looks like business is booming.
looky here, i know you helped her and i know you know what i want. jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. she do that, we're still friends. now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' louis. and if she tries to turn me in, i'll name her ass as my accessory. we'll go upstate together. hand in handcuffed hand. now that shit's a promise, understand what i'm sayin'? you tell her that, and i'll call you back.
look, ted, i'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  three marriages, two divorces...you're gonna be okay.
what the hell.  for you....
they all are. football's on.
yeah, but the margins are real wide.
why'd you do it? what'd i ever do to you?!?
think about it!  just think about it!
let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
i don't see why not.  why don't you come along with us?  we're on our way to see the wizard now. to get him a heart.
working for the district attorney.
you remember halle.
most of the time, all three precognitives will see an event in the same way.  but once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
you see how much we have to say.
sorry.  i thought it was empty.
remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
but just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while i was waiting outside your place...
get oack on their tail.
that's stupid. what are the odds of you being seen with me?
thank you, anna. i'll dry it up here when i wash it next. i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
right now you're in no position to ask questions!  and your snide remarks---
and if there is, then zero can kill someone?
i'm going to see the diva sing. what's the matter?... do i look bad?
it was an accident, i'll get you a new one.
you loved him.
everybody hates the messenger.
not the 't' word.
you mean that you can't come here and i can't go there?
i went to my room.
how old is anna?
you want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- i'll have a stroke.  i've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
we'll have every leprechaun in ireland here honey.
hey, it's a sellable skill.
the fidelity nonsense...
look at this, it's so lean and clean.
i did five years in attica. lot of cons helped me in the joint. but i never got help from any lawyer... i built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "art's supplies" is for ex- cons. not lawyers.
luther's on the move...
i didn't.
if she does it'll be a miracle outa scripture.
dad, no.  but i didn't want any problems, so i decided not to sleep with him.
cutting edge mathematics. think tanks. the kind of place where a mind like will's is given free reign.
walt needs to see you.
well, i really don't smoke.
and what happens if we say no?
now just a minute, major--
a new disease.
i had to. i was frantic. i didn't know what to do.
...to a tee. like the time tony dogs...
forgot what?
who? donnie and marie?
oh, it's superb--i mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
we can't wait. we all go together or not at all.
i don't think i've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
she sits down.
"we'll all have lunch."  good idea. oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game afterwards!
don't do it!
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. the theater is henceforth closed. as for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
i hate being lectured.
who's asking?
geronimo?
we're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
did you just talk?
i'll -- i'll get married. then i'll never be able to go anywhere.
you can't do this! this is new york! nobody lies in naked in a field in new york..it's...it's too midwestern.
i don't want to talk about it.
okay then.  have you got a lot of friends?
otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you. tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  right, otis?
hi. i'm donald kimball
yes.
you're amazing! you act like i don't live in that house! don't you think i hear the two of you!? don't you think i can tell what's going on? i'm not five years old, mom!  you want to divorce daddy and daddy doesn't want to.
don't you worry about a thing.  this hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
you think you can bargain with me?!
he was a stretcher-bearer in the korean war.  were you in a war with father?
y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
thank you.
i think you do.  better yet, i don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. and i think mr. smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
well, dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. they've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. i caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
evenin', ma'am.
no kidding?
it's okay.
good advice for the french, not for the english!  do you think god hates the english?
listen, stace, you want to know about guys? i'll tell you. they're mostly chicken. before i met doug i chased after every guy i thought was cute. i thought if i gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. well, guess what? they don't call.
and you too, ninotchka.
i don't like coconuts.
i have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and i am prepared to face it.  if it should come to war, and i presume that is what you are alluding to, i would rather have war with the emperor than my own people.
you tell on me, i tell on you.
then my luck would have changed.
jeanne... i have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to compiegne!
his personal safe, he gave it a name. now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? then who knows what else they changed.
i've chickened out. i'm afraid of him. he'll like that.
don't make me... i can't... i won't.
and instead,  i came -- bringing you nothing.
quite, absolutely - i always thought they were false.
but she's --
did you ever go i one?
is he in pain?
you were hired to look for tom, not someone.
quite a few.
i'm not being defensive.
no, why don't --
hello lloyd.
wonder what?
yeah, but check it out. it's gone!
what did you say your name is?
you mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
i know. i suppose, mr. paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
she'll rub it on me - and i'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
but don't worry...we'll be in heaven. the real heaven, i mean. not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. or not being. who knows. maybe we know now.
they do? oh no...
can you spare three hundred? pay you back next month, promise.
what're you crazy?
he knows where she lives?
i'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
and we intend to use them!
well, i don't need them...
sebastian was a pathological liar. i wouldn't believe a word he -
you work around town?
sorry, alan it's been six years.
the comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
it will be very dramatic.
paul!
back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? a change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
look, we have two choices.  we can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
i know it well, sir.
it's a bathtub. what she's standing under.
i...uh...i think she's doing fine on her own.
serious. but you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. she dropped it off for you.
really?
andrew hardly needed leading.  he was a very passionate man.  he was eager to explore.  i gave him what he wanted.  we fulfilled each others needs.
you did not ask me.
sir, yes, sir!
i am, but ...
what do you mean?
it won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
i'm thinking it's too weird now.
so they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
[the ransom was ten.]
oh, thank heaven.
i'm gonna go! three...two...one...
we're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
cut it out.
but... he only wrote nine, major.
a what?
i'm afraid that's not up to me.
no self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
no breach-of-promise case has been filed. the matter has been settled out of court.
who's coming?
as soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. if i told you what's going on in constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  this anonymous report was sent me. they are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. here...  "how can the bolshevik cause gain respect among the moslems if your three representatives, buljanoff, iranoff, and kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
then don't talk about killing.
you know, the whole world thinks you killed freddie? it's terrible.
what makes you think i'm not?
i'll see you there.
...sabotage!
let's do him right here.
we been shoppin'. can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
j.j. gittes. and it's not a departmental matter.
never mind those guys. all right, stand up. now let's see what you look like when you protest.
what are you talking about?
i don't know.  i can't understand it.  something's bothering them.
we'll go back tonight.  bring the children.
it's not a real school, it's a writing class, i wanna be a writer.
guess i'm not used to so much.
i've still got mine.
okay.
destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
now what?
the whole area's being evacuated.
do you know how you will use him?
i don't.
nikko?
wow. that's a place i've always wanted to go. is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
going to try. didn't say i could.
it looks great. don't change the subject. you know how busy saturdays are. and i can't do the icing. i always mess up the roses. you're not being very responsible.
of course, sir.
you believe in the boogey man?
hm?
robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
i know it!
but they sneer, don't they?
i guess not.
don't have to... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
who?
so what happened since? you're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
you mean for you.  a 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. and you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  this isn't going to work out.
mayo, zack mayo, sir!
oh, call me ida.  to what do we owe the pleasure?
i can imagine.
what an asshole.
and i understand why you might want to think he could.
they're inside --
monica, what did you do?
i'm going to bed now.
do you?
because memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  i'll go in the ring, and i'll announce that i will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and i'll let you win!  then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on letterman, like tiny tim did on carson... right there on the show!  what do you say???
why not?
no.  nor to elizabeth.
to throw out of the window.
nothing.
"my"...
cool.
shit, lenny. what's happened to you! we've gotta get help!
not yet.
so that's why we can't get along? because i'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
oh, yeah, i'm calm.  in fact, i'm totally "relaxed..."
yeah, but the untouchables took down capone. heller got shot and killed. the bad guys beat him. worse, sparazza walked.
i told you you wouldn't like him.
hold it.  you never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
but you could do it, baby. we could use the bread...
i wonder sometimes.
there's more than one?
they turned me loose from the state hospital.
to my father.  everything counts.
i know.
is he going to be okay?
his mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
are the coordinates set?
he said something about...
i hired them to. we're in my brain. but i want it to stop, before i wake up and don't know you anymore.
where's the body?
he looks perfectly fine.
i'm getting a little bit fat. i hate that.
maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. they probably don't think anyone would dare try.
i will finish what i've begun…
that sign.  do you think i could have the room for a single night?
actually, i volunteered.
you're goin' out to las vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. what the fuck? i mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
what??
don't know what?
no, -- it ain't fair to make pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. i'll tell.
how are you today?
pity, it tells it like it is. that's why the eastern, read jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. that's a quote from the book jacket. george will, i think.  i apologize if you can't understan a word i'm saying, dr. schwartz.
the guidance system's fried.  i had to switch to manual.  -- some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
what are you talking about?
i don't have much choice in the matter now, do i?  but i can't speak for italics.  traitor!
anti social?
donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>eastern europe</u>.  you made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  what is that?  but i needed you for the transfer with max.  i got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
i know that niche.
i grew up on your mov...
what is it? here!
i've changed my mind. i'll come to moscow. if you -- are still going --
oh yes, of course!  i thought you meant him!  you know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
this looks promising...
right now -- we'll drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
a blimp.
max never had many friends.  so much with the piano.  always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
then why are you teaching me...?
why would i do that?
huh?
sir, yes, sir !
what do you mean?
moving in?
you're never too old for a lolly.  i'm having one.
no! no don't shoot me i don't want to get shot!
thanks.  i thought you'd be older. i expected a red.
i'm not this way, you know. not usually. i don't fuss and fret over my children.  when frank died...  you see, he knew the children, he really knew them. he had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. that's a rare talent.
you think so, jack? well... i wouldn't want to be in that wally's shoes tonight.
no way i it doesn't make sense.
a reel?
i get a little bloated sometimes.
we'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. all of us. together. we all get one vote. includin' me.
no, not really.
it means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. you understand that?
oh, christ. did you go to bat for me?
certainly not mine. come on.
what did you call me, boy?
eight thirty.
let me breathe, let me breathe...
yeah, see you bright and early monday am.  say, where's the wife?
no!  nothing more will i tell you now. clear your mind of questions ... quiet now be ... at peace ...
you want my partner to kiss your ass?
really?  what was it like?  a down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
i didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. i'm sorry.
all of you!
we're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
nikki.
hi, happy.  well, you're obviously making him happy.
tonight, when we close.
go home!
a jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. while i was talking to frank on the golf course.
no... no it's not horse, you see i sold the horse.
so get the fuck outta here.
now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  he's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  and he's got a nuclear weapon.  so, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
what are you proposing?
a goodly length in times past, but lately
maybe you didn't, but i'm here to find out about a disturbance. some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
i don't know.
the "unknown hero."  they found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
but why come to me?
not interested.
you're a lawyer and you're here--
good.
could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
glenn?
more this way.
mints?
where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
i was in the neighborhood.
so?
maybe.
sorry. it's important.
yeah.  see you there.
i can't do anything to make you stay? these people annoy you, isn't that it?
oh come on!
nice one.  would you like my phone number?
deal's changed.
i seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't i?
you what?
"sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  backs together --
no. that's the last thing i'll do. you never asked what happened.
no.
it's just you.
we'll work something out, joe.
he went out drinking beer with mike godfrey and he won't be back until late. you'll have to call him tomorrow. besides, i'm on my way to pick up paul.
that's the rumor on the street.
i think so.
i don't know.  he sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  but i've never seen it.  it's in the exhibit.
my brother's a priest, man.
learn anything?
why not?
if we don't, he'll die.
the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
just thought his work should go on.
shh.  shhh....
it was just like in my head.
no. you can't trust her.
just figure it's my map, i ought to hang on to it.
we need a double-room and as i understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
she said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  the razor just happened to be there.
breaking out
you either.
alright, i love you.
do you have to swear all the time?
let's lock off this room.
<u>wildlife</u> footage, for god's sake. i don't see how he could've slipped you something that the fbi would be interested in.
okay, then ... i just go to the marriott and i'm set ...
thank you. i learn a great deal.
walter, you fucking asshole, we gotta go to pasadena!  come  pick me up or i'm off the fucking bowling team!
crime of passion. he just went nuts. he would have shot everyone in here. he just ran out of bullets.
and i was wondering...if...if i could have a...
john, hold on a second.  i'm in the middle of something important here.  you mind if...
binoculars.
not even if they're a dork?
michael.   yes.
they won't break this one.
if you want to keep it, you can.
is he nice?
wow!
joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in washington?
no.
right here.
i don't understand. why did you want to come here? i mean, i can't imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
did you used to?
nothing.
yes, of course, i'm so sorry. stupid of me. hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
see, ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". she shouts, i stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
isn't there a guard?  a janitor? a fucking cleaning woman? i'll take a burglar!  somebody's gotta be in th...
there is no fuckin' set up!  look, this is the news. blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. white and pink come with me, 'cuz if joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
yes sir, i do. last night's, fresh from the park.
queen cherlindrea?
nothing, crunch.  they picked him up like the rest of--
well, why don't you take it out of your account? there's a lot there.
where's the handle?
michael, you and i are light years apart. you should go, but not with me.
where are you going?
mornin'.
i don't freak out.
where is she?
you're crazy.  i'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
well, i'm carrying three people. and he's got only himself.
she already has a daughter.
no, my dear, it is true. that's how they live in the other world. here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
so, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
it was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
check it out... great huh? i tell you those guys know what time it is. man i'm with that...
snickers, make the list happen. oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  i've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
a forty-five.
you are not in a band, barry.  you are not a musician.  and no posters.
oh, shit.
no jokes.  james is in love.
for when the..uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. uh...
but it's breakfast for supper. your favorite, paulie. i made french toast and sausage. patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
do you wanna go to the van?
i don't trust you. no way! i pick who goes! and i'm holding you responsible.
you just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." i'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
no. i just wake up and i look around, try to figure out where i am... how i got there.
i'm going to tell the truth.
he thought i had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
you don't win by playing it safe, peter.
haven't heard a bird sing in days...
then you got undressed.
how'd you like to be married to... the king...?
no shit, sherlock. i can't believe it. i just killed my best friend.
it did?
what...?  oh.
true.
i'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. and me with a date, too.
laz. i'm gonna put my trust in you. i'm gonna do it knowin' all too well i can get hurt like this. and i have been hurt. just like you.  woman like me, i got a lot of livin' to do. but my days are precious to me. they all i got left. don't want no more fuss. i want love in my life. you understanding me, laz?
what's your favorite scary movie?
i'm training to....
the things you gotta remember are the details. it's the details that sell your story. now this story takes place in this men's room. so you gotta know the details about this men's room. you gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. you gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. you gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. and if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
i just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
what's the matter with you?
i think you have too much to do tomorrow.
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone.
being back here. gives me the willies.
no fucking.
those are my letters!
this was nothing like warsaw.  i held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
what... the dirty bitch! i hope ya trounced her a good one!
i fell in some mud.  now hurry up!
gimme that.
hawkeye's asking the major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
why is it -- breaking up?
please, you're just as ambitious as i am, more --
what about billy?
in order to keep elaine away from you -- i am prepared to tell her everything.
what did you guys think?
yes.
you talk as though you intend on staying.
not until like... eighth grade.
they have plotted against me!  me! the embodiment of god's will!
i'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
what'd he get you?
these were killers. conklin had them all jacked up. they were dobermans.
did you like her to watch?
as much as anybody.
aside from the obvious?
we agree on something.  and for insurance, take his coat.
fifth and mayflower. you know it?
loma vista?  you mean like the guy on "a reason to love?"
you killed him you fucking faggot --
it was never easy, but before jurassic park, you could find money. somewhere. now fossils are out. everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. joseph, send for clarence.
what happened to her?
don't think i'm weak, just because i'm a woman. i have power. give in, stop fighting me, ethan. i always get what i want.
take it off.
no i'm not.  i'm not star--
i couldn't do it.  how did i get here?
hey.
yeah.  i'm not trying to replace your dad... or steal your mom.  i just want to be your friend.
uh-uh.  no predetermined places and times to meet.  give me their heading and radio codes and i will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
yeah. do you paint?
little village down seven.  supposed to be charming.
he's getting big.  vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
it's on.
aren't you the lucky one...
no -- madam grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
well, come on, get your coat. we're going to pick up paul.
well, then logging got to be too much like work, so i went down to los angeles to the pier in santa monica. that's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
talk from there.  you can talk from there.
relax morty, i think your mom is wonderful. she cares so much about you. get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the jdl if i'd come eat by you once in awhile. like i needed any incentive to be with you. she's so...
relax.  helen still loves you. she just wants this guy to bang her.  it's nothing serious. you'll get used to it after a --
hmm.
oh, no problem at all.  i made the trip in three and a half hours.
i've told him. i've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
yes.
forget it, just go take care of her.
how many weeks?
no.
oh so god's like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? it's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
yeah, like that.  same thing.
george, don't be so emotional.  this is business.  besides, i can't kill you, you are my brother.
you want to read it?
been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from mr. dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
no.  not...not you.  you i forgive.
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
my ass be dumb, but i'm not a dumbass. go sit over there on the couch.
no?  why's that?
meet us on the bridge.  be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
absolutely.  and she's got great tits.
well, i got to get back. you can find your way out, can't you?
what?
i would never hurt you, liza. think whatever you want, but don't think that.
well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  specially for mr. hooks.
a shark fin?
don't equivocate.  be positive. just tell the truth.
let me get a shot of it.
i may not be dr. freud or a mayo brother or one of those french upstairs girls - but could i take another crack at it?
what?
where are you?
what?!
not when i get interested.
you think i'm fucking around here? mark it zero!!
we have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
his word.
hi, daddy.
what's your secret?
you want to say some words?
what else?
oh, george . . .
somewhere downtown.
not with those smokestacks it's not.
shit!
execute!
oh, that'll be nice.
wasn't my fault...
a miracle is an event without an explanation. if she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
this is a good letter, dad.
it means i'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
she your wife?
dream on.
she's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
you'll get no information from me. you have no authority... the council can't hold me!

i wish they had.  he takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  but you can't kill a man like fanucci.
course i'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  nice drinkin' liquor.
nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
that so.
they blame me for everything. her, tod, the plane crash...
there she is.
violet, it's gino and johnnie.  they were in a car accident.
they did it... they assimilated earth.
there's a million places to hide around here.
i kinda doubt it.
or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - i believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
holy shit, i don't know.
not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
that's absurd! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
maybe.  i said maybe.  what i mean is, ah...i don't think it'll really work out, but charley seems to want it, so...
ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
oh well, you know.
the audience is interested in you, sonny ... not me.
me? oh, you mean my body. don't worry, doc -- it'll go to the university -- i'll put it in writing --
i write about it?
i am accountable.
i. i don't want to see you tomorrow. mike's coming over.
you've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. i'd like to hear what it is.
hurry.  you have to get them out of there!
hey ben. there were a couple of guys looking for you.
rescued at last.
i'm not implying. i'm quoting. more vested interests...  "persons who will profit from this merger...  ms. helen caperelli, general counsel of cbs news, 3.9 million. mr. eric kluster, president of cbs news, 1.4 million..."
a day or so.
you're a good man. jimmy the finn.
got it.
where did he go?
yeah? greenbacks? i got ten million of them.
no -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, baron.
but you're -- divorced?
what about that psychic, what's his name, szabo?
i know. pull my legs. i'm stuck.
if sheep don't count.
i said i got his machine.
jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? we said it's for better or worse. we said it's for richer or poorer.
fine, honey.  stay asleep.
we're not even sure what it was.
oh sure, it was all mean old marcel's idea. give me a break! we didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! not to mention disgusting. look...
--vanished.
ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
you may call your next witness.
that's too bad.
about a year and half ago.
what gets me is i'm 46 years old. i've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
i'm getting married tomorrow.
okay.
oh shit!
somehow, i don't think that was walt whitman.
i'm sorry, officer.
maybe the bureau. or those bastards at treasury. i'll take care of it.  i hate this shit, johnny. you cut their balls off for me. i'm counting on you.
can i just say, i thought 'ghost' was a wonderful film.
you won't have any trouble finding it.
when i'm done.
i do.  i do want to.  that's why i'm leaving.  that's what you given me, see? i know what i want now.  i want a guy like you for real.  not because you buy me things and give me money.  the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. you gonna give me that?
what about the vault?
if you want to. naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
next week.
hey, i'm not a complete fool, you know. i can see you're going sour on me, and when i try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
maybe.  but not like asians.  we never panic.
just push the red button twice. that's what stops it. if that's what you want, babe?
it's mom.
i don't know... what you're...
cigarette?
who is this war against, sam?
oh! you caught me.
don't you usually like to sit at the back?  to wave at your dad?
not much.  it's hard to talk.
what have you been doing?
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  it's true, right?
good-night.
oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
miss kubelik -- fran.
yes.
a man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  i didn't get a good look at him.  i must call my wife...
we don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
the reprieve for earl williams.
vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  and i'm not any kind of samurai.
no -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
i'm not trying to pull against you, cooch. i've just been having nightmares about the way leo was killed.
don't duff--
thanks.  your dad called again – something about a job.
then it must be wednesday.
shoot him.
it's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
anyway, i'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things i couldn't give her. you know, hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. but all she really ever wanted was a home.
then say it.
every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
what did i think?
it's great when people who work together can become real friends.
how long does it take?
well, i hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. other- wise we're out of business.
don't bother, i can take it up myself...
all the time.
you're smarter than kobo.  you know the price of deceit.  think about it.
well, what is it, honey?
no.  they hired bain.  the contract would have been mine, but bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
-- yeah, i heard. but they won't hold him for long. anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
how's it going?
that's not far enough.  you don't know those guys!  but they know us.  every hood in chicago will be looking for us -
don't do this, hap...
he hanged him?  shot him down?
only by relation.  besides, they hate me, too.
they own the information he's disclosing. the truer it is, the greater the damage to them. if he lied, he didn't disclose their information. and the damages are smaller.
stop! who approacheth the bridge of death must answer me these questions three! ere the other side he see!
look it's very simple. you tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and i'll invent it. we'll be partners. fifty—fifty.
thank you.
alright.
lysergic acid diethylamide... with a little kicker of my own.  surely it must be coming back to you by now?
well, i --
who?
i want everybody to hear because i don't have anything to be ashamed of.
were we always explorers?
...i thought that we were only talking...
well we don't.
he's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. he got us an account number to boot. now even if he's just dumb and lucky, i say we back his play.  i put him out there, sam. if he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. i can't let that happen.
tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. you promised me.
i got caught robbing a synagogue. lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
nah, he's nothin'. it's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
gladys! stop it!
haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
the pentagon.
i like having the car, the car is important.
talk to him, bruce.  there's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
<u>yes</u>.
yeah, but that's not-that's no good. i want the whole thing.
you hired someone to open it.  i'll bet the lawyer loved that.
it's not me, it's my wife.
that would explain it.
standard equipment. the world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
one of our only leads... you had dates with both men right before they were killed.
it has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
ohh-hh, a little. oh-h, i ain't never been to no dentist before. he's gonna kill me, i just know it.
well... i'm goin' ta bed now.
no, you didn't.  when?
then take me with you.
your eyes told me.
on the phone.
knock it off! we got two men need attention here. police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. hoyt, junior, carry gardner.
no. but things ain't always like they seem, arletta. you know that. a man's gotta go his own way.
he's right here in the...
yes, thank you.  intravenous if possible.
magruder obliged me.  no use my saying it wasn't planned that way. i had to clean up.  i'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  nobody in the world would believe i didn't plan the whole thing.
i've seen it before.
the building superintendent, and two tenants. flat statements -- no hesitation. and they all jibed to the letter. the thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
i know i am. why, i even heard a shot up there last night.
sure –– sam wainwright.
fuck you.
we have decided to move the government to gitarama.
oh, i understand.
he won't take us.  don't you want us around?
i took the initiative.
these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class!
my pleasure, jody
yeah, i do.
what did you overhear?
keep your eyes on the ball, mister.
yeah well... i like movies. i figure if i help harry make one, i'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. that doesn't sound too hard. i was in the money business and i get ideas all the time.
hi, lance.
one last score, that the idea?  move to some island.
thanks.  what's that?
you'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
the nerve.
no... she just wanted something outta life. anything. and with del, she wasn't getting nothing. that's her husband, del. i'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way i feel about all of this...
when was this?
why are you being so grouchy--this is an important night for us...
who the hell cares?
who?
a month at most, that's all i ask.  elizabeth, please. things have not yet resolved. i must take steps to see that they do. for our family's sake. for our sake.  you are life itself. we shall seal our vow. the moment i am done.
so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership?
i need help.
everything.
want some?
no.
i wouldn't like to, but i will, if i have to.
i'm only asking you both to think about it.
no.
yeah? she's a shark, frances. i'm not taking you there, and that's that!
sometimes they do somethin' to you, tommy. they hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. did they hurt you like that, tommy?
no, hold back...
those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  they dive with a helium-oxygen mixture.  at that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
that night, i went to the houmfort. i kept seeing jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. the drums seemed to be beating in my head.  the chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  and then i heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  my voice.  i was possessed.  i said that the woman at fort holland was evil and that the houngan must maker her a zombie.
we're coming your way, man!
if that's my fate, so be it.  i'm not leaving.  i love her, jack.
you know them personally?
i think i've heard of you.
i guess, the truth is i'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  even when they try to act like heroes.
must be a circuit breaker.
you missed the tag!
bismark...
is that so?
i didn't know the answer --
not a one.  it's dead.
mack the mouth at a loss for words.
i don't know better. all i know is that you left me in there.
i know.  everyone went home.  we offered them refunds.
i'm not like you.
i'm not hungry.
sure. one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago.
let me tell you something.  listen to me.
you're acting kind of...odd.
no buts. i told you your friends were jackasses.
i don't know.  i'm just guessing.
but you were.
thanks.
it was a long time ago, at some heaven and hell mixer.
well, then, w-who was?
course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. that's what he's doin' with this stewardess. he's scheming how he can get it over here.
c'mere, i'll show you.
call the fbi.  use a pay phone.  don't give 'em your name, dad.  just tell 'em that it was shepard who killed finelli and clark and the others.  that he's the nightingale.
i want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what i got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... i don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
but, you do come from a military family?
whew, at last.  nice to meet you, mr. black.
library of congress.
anon, good nurse. anon.  master shakespeare?!
why?
how long would that take?
but then it is better this way, don't you think?  no loose ends.
why?
our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
sheriff? i'm doctor sam loomis.
well, that's it! i may as well go and hang myself! this sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! that was simmons doing! and he and jeffries always sit together at lunch! the bastards!  ow!  perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
there's some folks i want to keep tabs on. dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. your kind of people.
like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  wouldn't matter.  you'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
you don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
to risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
but you knew about this.
it's not that i didn't mean everything i wrote.  it's just that -- i thought you were dead.  and now --
so i come to england with other actors to make shows, i meet this freak from novgorod i tell him of you and chicken and the birthday here we are.
you're coming with me?
yes?
i'm sorry too.
me? what'd i do?
yeah, but they leave you plenty.
learned judges: my case is simple. it is based on our first article of faith: that the almighty created the ape in his own image; that he gave him a soul and a mind; that he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
hmmm. claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her. i told her that wasn't true, i just knew the event horizon better, that's all.
what's this?
where are we? we're on the street. we're walking down the street. we're talking to ourselves. people are staring at us.
she didn't even know you. .
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
we'll have to go out on tauntauns.
the official cause?
hi, ted.
right, now i need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
tortures so arcane, so medieval, even i haven't the words to describe them. if you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
no.  i didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  instead... i was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  i couldn't bear it.  i broke off my meditation.  i couldn't go on. there was something... pulling me back.
do you mind?
he didn't say that.
you can't forgive me. after what i've done.  i've fucked up bigtime. i've been bad. real bad.
someoneís after me.
for agnes.
the hotels are useful capital investments. the kids liquid assets. my guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
oh, sure.  that was a long time ago. see, she's not a man-hater at all. she's very supportive of men...
captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
that dog ain't mean.
there are things that speak to us from the past.
where would i have seen your work?
who's gonna smell me a mile away?
on screen.
it is serious, mrs. ramos.
wait a second --
mine, and they never tip.
tranquilizer.  causes drowsiness.
sure it is. that's why you act so funny around each other.
the trouble is, i'm gone now. for you. and i can't do anything about it. i want you to love me. if i let you change me, will that do it? if i do what you tell me, will you love me?
my dear mozart, there is no one in the world i would rather help, but now it is too late.
make that 1790.
then why are you eating alone?
push!
"follow in the footsteps of shiva. do not betray his truth."
go ahead.  i'll expose you.
come on. you brought it up. do you know anything?
you could've come over.
you must be high. uh-huh. no way.
business is slow. i told my boss about you, about your condition. he told me to try and rent you another room.
yeah, i know.  this is it, isn't it?
yeah, no kidding.
okay, there was a tasting last night. but i wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. check out the box.
you'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
i can't tell you, amy.  you know i can't.  you have to trust me...
yes? -- tomorrow?
not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  whatcha thinkin', jim?
i've been working night and day.  i haven't had time.
meaning, viznick's a man who answers to no one.  not even god.
what makes you think so?
listen, dammit.
yah, well, i, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - linda passed away. she, uh...
there ya go. always remember, focus on the peach...
how did i get in the house? how did i get into my bed?
as charlie steinway is my witness.
all of us are ... we are all britons.
i'll wait there.
the truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
you should talk to him about this.
i don't think your mother would like that.
what have you left for me?
real soon, jamie. now shh.
you gotta admire the man's determination.
he's dead. an accident. hit by a bus.
i've always taken care of you.
it's not ignorant.
how much?
why? is it because of your white gal? folks say you're running around town with her.
i guess i'll make me some trouble in that town.
life doesn't... make... sense. this city's k-killing me. i want my liquid hijack marlboros!
i don't know. he just appeared as magic.
i don't think so.
lets throw another log on the fire.
ok, bye, bye.
well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  a termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  it is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  she is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
he's the only one i told.
you must get a lot of overdoses. i bet you picked me up a couple of times.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
and it's bullshit. and if i'm right, are you going to put the journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
what's c.r.s.?
what just happened to me anyway? it looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
good.
never
you'll pay for this, marvin a. pickles!  i'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  the prosecution rests, your honor.
now?
the freighter started through at 1:42.  the sea water seeped into carl's watch and stopped it. at 1:47.
yes...?
do you mind?  you're sort of ruining it for me.
hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. it -- it wouldn't be cricket!
sure.
i just don't want to go over it any more.
i don't blame you, earl.  if i were in your place i wouldn't trust anybody, either.
i'm asking for real. i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. will you?
yes. absolutely. despite your crass behavior, i'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
wilfred, that's not bad.
we're going for a walk.
oh yeah, since when?
oh cuervo...
huh.  okay.  well, i guess i'd better do my count.
this is my house. nobody's kicking me out of my house. i picked those drapes.
didn't they tell you? that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
why not?
seems to be back to normal, sir.
because i don't want to ruin things.  because home is where the heart is.
i don't know.
and leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
i'm fine.
you're coming with us...
we don't know that for sure.
we'd hoped to make it straight to san francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
what kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
they seemed to buy our story about the hanta virus. you'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  maybe a small roadside memorial.
yes, very well, thank you.
yeah, that's what i'd recommend. you know how it is. tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
evil?  do you believe in evil?
i work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. i try to help them figure things out.
surely you are familiar with this practice, mary clarence.  only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
nobody's gonna do that, mr. connell. they can't use the john doe clubs for politics. that's the main idea.
you going to tell him?
s.a.c. darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
it never solves anything.
your wire ester - she passed away.
it's those feathers.  they tickle.
funny -- you look married.
hi.
it's what eddie wants. he, uh, told me to give you some money.
we must talk, darling.  it appears we have to... redefine the nature of our association.
no... they don't kid.
darth vader reads poetry...
yes, but very well.
yes.
the premiere. i never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
main street.
that isn't very nice.
the kind we've been talking about. can you answer me now?
mr. nelson, you disappoint me. first you break our school board rules. then you break the law.
punishing.
huh?
no, it's not. [beat] it's december 25th, 2004.
see, i can't do it. i came out of the desert.
--take excalibur. find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
we'll have to make them come to us, won't we? and since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  first: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
is that... one person?
you like that?
do you miss it?
do they?
gino travels with a big man named roy.  caesar calls him the driver.
... graveyard shift.
you must be so pleased, i followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.

c'mon!
honest. the place we stashed it opens monday morning. i can't get it till then. monday morning, that's when it opens. after that, i'll get the money to you right away...
i don't follow.
fuck off.
the turk wants to talk!  the nerve of that son of a bitch!  after he craps out last night he wants a meet.
i ain't in a hurry.
you're out of your mind.
actually, it is kind of rough.
that's just about the dumbest thing i ever heard, wizard.
hey!  make yourself useful!  go save a tree!
it was magnificent, man!
i see.
why us?
you know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. now just leave her alone for a while!  i'm just suffocating. 
what for?
"i'm an incredible woman?"  what is this, a death sentence?
yeah, i think a woman.
yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
claire, will you calm down?
. . . tubby?
i was hoping you'd say that.
alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
i hope they're doing better than we are. we don't even have helmets.
no, that's called not having a mind of your own.  what are you doing, maggie? you really want to let that man drag you up annapuma on your honeymoon?  you don't want to climb annapuma.
scared of a girl?
he's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
i'll carry a copy of one of your books. harry gave it to me.
why?
you think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
i see. the men. you'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
you said the guy down here is good.
she said to remind you that you're having shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the manischewitz.
because you're an idiot.
for real?
you'd rather spoil our walk home.
lan's, i'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.

from what you saw, did huey newton start the shooting?
well, i'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
well that depends.
please. i want you to. it would make me so happy.
yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  three years later and he's still classified?  they gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... put it in context, bill, of what we know about oswald.  lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the marines at 17.  he learns russian, he acts overtly marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate.  he's discharged from the marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  he stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to moscow...
fuck you, roy ostrey!
wonder. beauty. joy.  love.
i dunno.  yeah!  yeah!  yeah!  i did.
simulated one.
it's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
yes, that's correct.
but you knew why. knew why, didn't ya.
yes.
no, i am not. it's quite common in new york state...
you go first! there's no time!
you just said...
well yes i understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  you're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
what do you mean "complete"?
but this isn't the jungle!  this is new york.  how did it get here?  a thing like that crossed two continents.  it makes no sense!
i'm the one what?
your family doctor?
lunch in a restaurant.
very....very!
at least somebody’s using the damn thing.  i was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.

i don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
is he cleaning house?
let's go.
uh huh. the retail end, i understand.

i don't know. maybe i will say it. how old are you anyway?
he's best friends with jim gordon and harvey dent.  they would know.
thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. got me all curious.
who?
junior!
ohh, right. would you like a soda?
then why stay in the hills.
frannie.
much more colorful than the ones we wear.  and, of course, less dented.
then it’s no longer a bomb?
the first rule of project --
assign another team if you need to. i want to re-establish communication with the captain as soon as possible.
fuck you.  i got a call today from sally doneghy ...
who?
silky an' faith, they rode off to the east an' two deputies was followin' them.
me?  i was at rigoletto.
yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
really.
a what?
uh-huh.
i know you will, bruce. are you going to live with your mother?
<u>someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on dr. lechter's head. 
i'm saying i didn't sign it!
i don't think so. keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
why, thank you, david.
yes, general formica.  carry on, my good man!  i don't know what we would do without you.
well it's the company motto: 'if you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
i don't care, i've changed my mind.  ... i feel <u>really</u> confident.  we're getting better at this stuff.  we can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  i've got an idea.  you're going to love it... i'm going to hate it.
yes?
i like them french-fried potaters.
i have no idea who you are.
no.
big house. how many rooms?
have ya been to the celebrity room before? with other, uh, clients?
i guess i ain't.
one, vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. they're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. i mean, if you want to have any fun.
you can trust me on this one.
what is that?  you drop your dive light?
not bad.
oh, it wasn't my secret, richard. victor wanted it that way. not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. that was his way of protecting me. i knew so much about his work, and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
i like it.  really....
okay.
then tell them i had a seizure.
well... i need to close now --
i'm sorry.  that was impressive. the...  tumbling.
it's left its mark still. the last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. take them into town. get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. it's good medicine.
i do renounce them.
aye, sir
let's see... where was i?  oh, yes.  he went to find the man. that man was desperate!  he knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. he killed wynant.  it's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, dorothy.
how would you know?
how do you feel?
umm, ummmmm
here. here. is this enough money?! huh?  will it last you two fuckin' days? take it, greedy bitch.  take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
girlfriend, you got a man.  you				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
she had beautiful hands.
no, it's not that, it's...
i was gonna...

as far as i know.
i know who it is.
i have acted as i think fit.
because i want justice. i want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  and i want to have a little fun.
get me a six pack.
yes.
yes. the five men. they were, of course, your husband, charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and carson dyle. but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
yeah.
i guess he figured it was better.
yeah sure i'll grab something before i go...  hey -- i've got a surprise.
we got a barrel on him. we can't lose him. we stay out here until we find him.
right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. everybody knows the story. the entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. on pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! and the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
you're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
with what? wiseguy money?
you crashed my file?
i'm going to amarillo.
who says i can't? you're a newspaper man.
to tell you that we're interested in the property.
but you're happy here -- you like your work —-
ten here.
fuck you!
please.
you've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers.
no. walked.
oh - and what's so stinking about it?
we've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. surely they've disposed of these boots by now. wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on gorkon's ship?
where's ricky.
the sheets...
no, i don't think so.
before he can get there here comes this federal marshal, and franky's indicted for jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   jimmy, gimme another drink.    how are you?
get out
i mean, why did you get married? was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
in seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of nebraska.
a fellow investor.
why not? i need to get in there!
she's gone, gone to town. she hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
what makes you say that?
you're ready, don't worry.
i did not steal this truck!
what is it?
yeah.
breakfast.
it’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
he's a hairdresser.
we could be together again --
what way?
in richard nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  if i were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
that's like saying they're in arizona.
i think that's what you ordered.
no you're not. jack lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. you haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. and mr helpmann. mr helpmann was very close -
you have sixty seconds... here's the question...  which one of you is frances?
i bit his jugular vein.  now will you shut up and get up here???
i need very little sleep. we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
we'll see.
yeah?
about what?
i spose i'm drinking myself to sleep. it's helena's christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
i want one with you.
because you're tainted. the venom's still inside you. you could still turn on us.
i'm fine!
look, rob.  if great sex was as important as you think it is, and if i was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. and that is my last word on the subject, okay?
no, the mediocre mantini. of course the great mantini!
a situation easily remedied.
mary taylor, sir.
no.
you were talking in your sleep.
yes, of course.  lots of questions.
i swear.  on my life.
i'm an attorney. i'm with moss, brice & fromeyer.
it's too bad you don't live down here, ted.
not to mention andrew zhdanov... otis, come!!
emma!
can see you do. sorry i couldn't make you feel better. you want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... and the theft, is what you want to do!  sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. how about that?
no.
ah! well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
help me lift her.
with all due respect, your honor... we don't live in this courtroom, do we?
well if you're sure, i won't be a bother. oh, i don't sleep on no spring mattress. i always make myself a pallet on the floor.
how the fuck do you know?  what is it with you and this broad anyway?
arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. they miss you pretty bad down at the garage. i told 'im you still had a "fever".
well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
...and she doesn't always -
well, how far didya get?
what?
all right i got a little surprise for you --
and jack wants to trade the missiles in turkey.
maybe later in the week. first i've got to find myself a job.
none of which i am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
i'm absolutely positive.
commandeer.  we're going to commandeer a ship.  nautical term.
really?
i saw him. just a minute ago. some guy.
you're fucking me.
sure.
goin' in. we got a sales convention. gotta be there tomorrow.
what do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
dolores, meet roger rabbit.
in here. with us.
i guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
so what are you going to do?
no!  i'm not going to leave daddy with them!
well you're probably right about that. it certainly can't help sister agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
dad, please.
how's it going?
we aren't going to have a war.  we're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
and - uh - i  guess, 'goodnight'.
oh hi.
it is true.  you know how you love, joe? you dedicate a book to someone.
but he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
this is.  go home.  stay out of this.
don't be ridiculous.
they're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
just a thing i was workin' on.
no!  please leave!
no.
hell, no!  i told this bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. i deal with muni court, i'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
hi, dad.
that's all i need from you. that's more than i could ever ask for. you're just golden, dude.
no, i think you'll find i looked like he could have? by accident even? he's up here spraying the scenery all day.
how can you be fair with animals? they recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own grandmother's neighborhoods.  and everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  let me run my family without you on my back.  i want them taken care of.
...girl, y'know i had to bring big mamma through.
three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
the doctors.
it is to us!  it's computerised.
so? what's l.a. like?
that is so sexist. the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct.
most people are.
i'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, mr. ansel.
hello.
ilsa, i don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
just feeling a bit sick.
the police station.
listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
yes.  it's a present.
what makes you so sure?
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
no wait, don't go!
two or three years ago.
and what in heaven's name brought you to casablanca?
we can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
is... is it... loaded?
i contacted ernie roman's manager, he's fighting in france the same week.
marc shermin.
yes. hi..congratulations. jack lucas. nice to meet you finally. this is anne napolitano, the owner of video spot.
i got him.
pity.
trix...
seven hundred each.
all in good time, mister mcmurphy. all in good time.
with tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
a regret. it was just the two of us, dad. it was a lonely way to grow up. for you, too. if you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
good to meet you, dr. wigand.
this may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. i've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
i'm down.
right.  the royal.  when's the last time we were there?
don't look so scared.
 i must not fear. fear is the mind-killer. fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. i will face my fear... i will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- the reverend mother moves her face up to his. her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. she is smiling.
that dern doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. will you give me your word you'll do it?
officer white?
oh, i know that! that's charming!  i didn't know you wrote that.
i am?
we got a cookaboo inside.  he wounded some kid earlier.
did you... did you... ?
he what?
you don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, cole?  have it taken away?
he's not sorry, okay, fine.  why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? i'll work on getting a specimen, i'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. okay? everybody happy?
of course we do! we've been friends for years.
thank you, carl.
no big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
mr. concannon...?
listen, my darling... raoul was a... a good friend.  and now he is dead and that is very sad but --
got it.
i thought it was a pretty good beginning.
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
war?  no!  i did not!  when you said compromise was possible i believed it was probable.  there's no middle ground at all?  we're the king's children!
i'm not.
oh, no, sir.
the golden warriors.
just a moment, how did you get in here?
i don't know, but i sure hope so.
must be.
put it in the guard's barracks.  man they got pissed.  they beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  you oughta see 'em run around.
yeah.
ahhh.  and is there -- a doll?
why? what's happened?
not tonight, i have work here.
i'm afraid they do.  far too often. so long.
great
you think he's smart?
please, if i start talking --
it was just a trim.
a cop?  you want me to trust a cop?!
look, sorry. don't say a word.  i know this is improper. i've been trying to speak with deputy director koessler. i left a message. i must speak with you before you go back to washington.
good night, josephine.
no, i do not have any of those.
no. i mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. that old doctor in london -- he told me.
joe sounds like a ringer, bill.  i have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  need any help with the details?
we have a little arrangement. anything happens to me, you're dead.
if i don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  all my manuscripts -- just burn them. please.
i almost saw catalina.
i have a place for that.
i didn't --
wow ! santori and zegema beach, i've always wanted to go there.
forget it. he'll be back here. they've got no proof.
hm?
i know.  it's terrible!
llewelyn can take care of hisself.
get out --
but you didn't join a conspiracy.
kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. the thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
hello -- who is this?
you think so?
come on in!
give me a chance --
yes, madame colet?
i don't believe you, eddie. i think you're still a loser.
nice meeting you, knox.  bye, gin.
leeloo... is... she's...
follow me close. gentlemen, gooday. a word with one of you?
i don't understand.
yes. when i tell you.
yes.
in the strait of malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, mr. bond.
i don't know, but i think you're right. he's lying.
why do you think he did it?
sure, claude, whatever you say.
i'll wait for you till seven.
i'm not hungry.
i just gotta talk to her, t.j.
i'm not leaving it here.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
uh huh.
german.
uh...c?
give me the clipboard.
i think you should ask mr. rand that.
nellie baby, i'll make it up to you.
where did you get them developed?
really?    me too.
i'm not like you, you have your wife.
we're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
yeah.
better yet.
no.  i'm running <u>to</u>.
oh yeah, he's good.
negative effect.
why?
the funny thing is, i'm not randall either. i'm logue.
it's an old psychological strategy, number one. to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
nothing, huh, do you know what i'm doing?
i think i'll kill her.
the last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
what was that?
you're exaggerating!
i guess. walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
right.
watching tv.
pamela landy?
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. we wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
let's find out.
the mafia hire jack hewitt?
it will work out.
the kind where there isn't really an answer.
because we aren't ready yet for the french. before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. of course, there is the casbah. but even the casbah isn't safe yet. there are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. we must either convince them or eliminate them. we must think of ourselves first. we must clean out the casbah first. only then will we be able to deal with the french. do you understand, ali?
well you're not getting, either.
because you are dangerous.
you sure you can manage?
birds are not aggressive creatures, miss. they bring beauty to the world. it is mankind, rather, who...
i want to know what my child is going to face.
sleep is all stress reduction. here.  you take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  why do you think i'm telling you this, frank--for my health?  you ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. kanita, get him a glass of water.
who's that!
yes, but.
yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. when i find the exact binary sequence and i apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer i built you last christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
that is a contradiction. the borg act as a collective consciousness. there are no individuals.
it doesn't make any sense.  he wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
saw what, mr. cooper? what did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
what's wrong?
something wrong with that?
yesterday.
okay.
no.  just no.
yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
got run over by a car.
sure, sure. i'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
you got that right.  now get up. we're walking out of here.
i'm sorry but you're...
perhaps.
modelling.
okay.  how 'bout carla goodspeed?  six years, bill.  we've lived together six years.
i promised to protect her from people like you.
mary clarence, could you?  mary lazarus, you're terrific, but...  could you help us?
don't tell me you've actually read it, jeremy.
just think about it.
charlie bronson's always got rope.
one partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. name's carl taylor. long record of arson, assault, the works. the other print - we got nothing from our data base or the fbi or cia... still waiting for interpol.
well, i'd make an exception in this case if i were you.
no.
no thanks.
well mom, i'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
no sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
well, george, i invest for a lot of people. i make a lot of money for them. more than they could do for themselves.
waddaya talking about?!!
okay, fine.  <u>fine</u>  you backed me into a corner again.  you're holding me hostage ...
thanks.
the bitch was there.
don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
she may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
which way do you want to go?
yeah.
one night stand?
teach! where the hell are you?! where's our visuals?!!
cameron, what is the matter with you. you act like they're your mother or something.  you afraid of them?
there's a manhole at canal and bowery.
who said anything about killing?  just keep driving straight...
don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
who are you? what is your name?
are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the senate arms committee?  i mean, i'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
much better--thank you--
probably right.
cut some kind of a deal.  i heard that's what flynn's doing...
journalism lesson number one.  if you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
what troubles you?
it will.
so i'm told.
what would you do for me?
little celebration before we set off.
no.
i'm on a leave of absence. forced vacation.
first one what?
i'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
we have to pull him. he's not going to be able to handle the soviets in front of the u.n. zorin will eat him alive.
what time was this?
are you a lawyer?
alright.  in the shop you mentioned something about--
man, fuck you!!!
i didn't sell nothing! i didn't sell nothing! i just carried the drugs from the chief to sam.
i know you don't know. i said guess.
emily -
i guess so.
i will, dad.  bye, luv you.
i've got you. i won't let go.
karl.
i'm sorry.  do you live here?
i don't know.
you do? you do love me?
excuse me. i really must he going.
here's to the greatest job in the world.
okay.
bet your ass i have. it's an important job, neighborhood watch is.
is on its way ... the helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
i'm in construction.
but ain't no reason--
pain.
what would make you think that?
it was right up on the pg&e property over there.
put the plates down.  it's over.
waiter, the check.  this man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
i was driving back from apache wells when they got me on the radio.
what about friends?
i understand sir.  could you slide your shorts down please?
why not?
these guys back home don't give a fuck about the supreme court and any of this bullshit! they want things to quiet down. they want you to walk away from -
hi.
let go! we've got to stop!
come on, copper.
listen to me, fettes, i'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with macfarlane, and one part fey. you're a lowlander, fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we highlanders call the second sight.
slavers capture them and bring them here.
i'm working on it... i've got a few leads... it's just that right now i have, all these projects that take up all my time.
such as?
you look beautiful to me.
absolutely.  when i come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  what do you think?
i fucking vouched for you. i vouched for you and you fucked me.
is your bad?
but they were indians themselves.
but where's the damage?
and if it got to clark... clark could have gotten to anybody.
twenty-five grand is peanuts!  all you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
what's going on?
thirtieth floor, sir. you're expected.
yes.
alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. under the world clock. alone. give her your phone.
an act of congress!
you sober?
johnny, please. calm yourself.
you wanted to see the propellers?
you know what i mean.
oh?  what do you call it then --a success?  the marriage ended in divorce.
well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  eighty-six it.  we'll blow up the place...burn it down.  something.
you're free, plissken. but if you even so much as break wind on a country road i'll crush you like a bug.
gotta light the scene better.  now it's more moody... like a scene from the third man.
yes!
you might loosen the straps then.
it's me...
okay.
that... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
hi, nick.
maybe he melted.
yes i do.
it's really quite simple... the three- body problem, you know.
since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
this one looks familiar, but i don't know.  naw.  there's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over chicago.
wait. you can't go.
yes! this was how i could be put out of the senate and out of the way! they even *promised* me that if i--
no i'm not.
what then?
certainly - how about some breakfast?
can you?
i got things to do.
in my handbag.
large resources, starling, which i prefer to devote elsewhere....
you're better than candy.
i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls.
i'll check with eve...
it's... a leap of faith. oh, god.
yes.
the warehouse.  buxton seeds.  it's tomorrow.
i know.  i know.  we don't have to talk about that.
hair stuff?
wes is dead!
helllllp!!!!
mission... statement...
oh... not a real doctor.
yes...
and are you afraid?
 there's gotta be...
you on a roll?
what?
i don't know about that. she was pretty into it. but i wasn't gonna try. the whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. show 'em some respect.
fine. except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my civ pro professor. but no biggie. you're here now.  how was your summer?
uh...yes, at the moment.
not now... i don't want to think about it--
there's a red light on the second intake valve.
'kay, mac!
good, now get your goddamned gear.
forget what?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. figured you'd know something about that, wade.
well, uh, trini and i have an early plane.  we were hoping to get back to new york in time for ...
what on earth gave you that idea?
would you let me pass?
sure was crazy. i dreamt i was your father.

yeah. you're so lucky. he really loves you, too. he's always telling walter how wonderful you are.
yeah. you got the whole story just right.
what did you use before?
she's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
a) it's always the person you don't suspect; b) that means you think it's tex because you really suspect gideon; therefore c) if you think it's tex, it has to be someone else -- gideon.
benjamin?
i just pulled and it - it came off.
uh huh. you know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? she came home and painted this whole room pink. she was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
no, i did not. must have been gary at the hitching post. i think we mentioned it to him the first night.
'neutron man'... 'laser man'... i can see why. 'tarantula man'...
don't you watch television? don't you listen to the radio?
hang on.
i'm sorry. here. this'll pay for a course in karate.
stay to your left.
that's right. and you beat round 1. now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  meet me beneath the hollywood sign in ten minutes. i'll have your girlfriend. we'll be waiting.
i couldn't. do you know how hard it's been not to call you? i pick up the phone every night. whenever that commercial comes on...
you're kidding.
don't worry.  i'll have a cool scar.
we have volunteered to rendezvous with the klingon ship that's bringing chancellor gorkon here, and escort him safely through federation space.
what... huh?
i pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than i should.
will you listen to this man? will you just listen to him?  you really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, god knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  that could ruin us.
i'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
everyone's capable of murder, osborne.
being violently ill to her tummy.
34,000. but they're real short lines. 'just came out that way.
was there anyone with you last night?
madmartigan.
go fuck yourself.
what?!
the best defense is offense.
this, this... this is bullshit!
now. i'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that drs. towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed...?
yeah, well max offers a lot of things. and i got news for you. he's not the sweet old man you think he is.
then she said -- she loves me.
i got the message you called too.
bird. that's jazz.
it's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
so, what about you?
i don't care about the money. i just want to work again.  you don't know what it means to know that you want me.
great, get in. we'll switch off in a bit.
i'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
she had another name once.
it just occurred to me i don't know your first name. all this time and i don't know it.
i'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  i'm the one with a schedule.
all right, take care.
okay, down boy.  i can't take this for driving you home. i wish i could, but i can't. so here, take it back. i could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. now take it.
yes, sir.
yes.
i don't know. he bathed, now he is roaming the ship. he must be the only engineer in starfleet who does not go to engineering!
well, i flew single-engine fighters in the air force, but this plane has four engines. it's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
joey ....  look, you wanna ride?  i can go by your place.
no.
she figured it out.  i'm sorry if that upsets you.
well you could tell him otherwise.  it was good of you to be all this help.  but he doesn't want to go tonight.
i like the sound of that.
ed.
commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? these were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
god i hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
end a april.
i don't know that.  that's what i'm telling you.
no, are you?  we want some black people up on the wall of fame.
i doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
i...i'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
it must've happened right after we left.
he knows what he has to do....
andy?  when a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  you look under the bad.  i'm three years old.  call the prison.
why not?  you've done just about everything else on this operation.
they will once i hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
she killed him.
yes, i know.
what?
i promise.
no.
let it go.
you stay out of this, look, if i had a red xk-150 with a black interior, i sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.

joe--*you* know what i'm talking about. the perfect man. never in politics in his life. wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. but the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
the money would go to frank.  the court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
i'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.

kalen... hold on a minute.

i'm a water-skier.
it's been a long time.

...and you don't have to put up a dime, roger.

it isn't yankee whisky, daddy, it's scotch.
a most perceptive choice, madam, if i may say so.  monsieur?
i stole it. from a synagogue.
oh, ray --
what're you doing?
i thought only hookers drank those things.
hos qordu. 
not unless you're sent to the "clinic."
romance!
this mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
i...
were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
no. no one special.
why are you so interested?
hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. not too far from here. this one's better looking than the doc.
my house.  i want to try something.
i understand.
wow, you can't buy this kind of publicity!
oh, there you are, honey. we were waiting for you. what happened?
you know, i had a crazy dream last night. it was about you.
it was just after we moved here. my little girls got in a fight over tony pee-pants and they haven’t made up since.
regret.
you never - ?
no...
how much?
indeed, he has often told me.
we're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
hundred dollars?
the basic grammatical rules of robbing.
he's looking for something. won't stop until he finds it.  sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
what?
i've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
hey! another shot for the lady and a double for me!
well then - yes.  of course.
hello, thomas, how do you feel?
leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
baba mama!
you'll be a father any minute now.
this is a local writer.  kay had all his books.  i think we should check it out.
sean, please..
paper or cloth?

what's happening?
you did?
i know son, i know...
hi.
it's not. i can't take it.
mmmm, you're right. those clothes don't do you justice. why don't you take them off.
thank you. no more questions.
you must be mistaken.
yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. zuzu's sick.
give the flower a drink.
why not sit down and wait?
that's what they called it. a fast trip right down the ladder.  right to the primal fear, the base anger. i'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. but i don't need to tell you. you know.
what ?
i don't understand.  overman's too good a diver to disappear.
did vaughan go home?
sure, i suppose.  that why you're on a bender?
excuse me, missus. no time for the old in-out, i've just come to read the meter. slide of bird's nest with eggs.
uh, thanks...
ah, so i pull the strings!
you cannot say that!
i certainly hope so.
what are you thinking?
yeah, you better remember that.
some times...
i'm ruth's niece. my name's betty. i'm sure she told you i was coming.
yeah.  you gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  that's real progress for you.
"blood?"
goodnight.
if you set me free i will find my way back to the army, march on rome and depose you.  then, the army and i will restore the republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
i guess not, bob. i don't like guns around.
pay attention? i'm not paying any attention to him. you think that guy could get me upset? hah! not that mug. he's a tough mug - hard, cynical. he doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  a bird in a gilded cage, huh? it's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. stew smith, a magnolia! not me. say, i'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! i'll tell you that. not me, not me. i'm going to step out and mean something in this world. you watch me.  say, am i a lucky guy to be near anne schuyler?  i've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me i know it. lucky, i'll say i'm lucky!  don't you think i'm lucky, gallagher?
i can fix cars.
yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
i'm -- i'm afraid i have no money.
look, my wife is understandably--
d'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
oh, there must be one in paris... they have everything in paris.
what do you mean?
father's . . . i never knew he had a diary.
leavin', boy?
there's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
that was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
you've done a lot of growin'...
then they hand me sollozzo.
all right. all right. i just cleaned b-8. give me a break.
where are they?
...yeah?
i think i've found a way to find kristen. i have a plan. but i have to be alone.
yeah... i'd like that.
didn't scare little bill though, did it?
keep your shirt on! i'm almost done!
bomb?
unless spoken to, ain't that right, horrace. didn't you say that?
what's that?
what do you get?
you're not a private detective either, are you?
it's her!  i'm telling you.  she whispered and turned on the music.  she's trying to contact me!
when you don't they're usually nice.
because of the gold.
i'm not interested in you. you disgust me. i'm interested in my own nature and know i can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
him?
sure. it's the right size and everything. i even saw its phalanges today! check this...
i'm not cranky.  and that futon was not too big to carry myself-
are you crazy!? you know that's totally impractical. besides, like the bible says...  an eye for an eye...
i can help you solve the case, i can tell you who did it.
your arm, you can't...
word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think buddy done it.
keep it down, okay?  drumlin thinks i'm enough of a flake as it is.  look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  caven goes to topless bars, vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
good point. excuse me, gentlemen.
what's a ditty again?
easy, that new checker faked the receipt. here it is, boss. 
try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and i won't have to hassle you...
i'm going to see a man called julian cross. ever heard of him?
the water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and ben&ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious thai stick.
i couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
i do.  who is it?  the doctors. what do you owe them?
i don't know.
recruit us to do what?
what? you don't see enough of me at the store?
look over there. two women fucking a polar bear.
who didn't?
really.
i wisht it was day.
god isn't there to do it.
look, i didn't touch it. alright?
we're moving.  i've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. my name's been in the papers too much. sometimes i wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. i'm not thinking of myself. but my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
research.  if your pal was there i never saw him.
don't cry, bubba.
you must listen to me before you go.
yeah, but we have an audit here, i just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
just as the freighter comes through? isn't that quite a coincidence?
you shall find me apt enough to that, sir. and you will give me occasion.
i completely agree.
look, sweetheart, i'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
it's bone dry, morty.
this is bigger. seven years to the day. no blackouts.
an' everyone will say walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
i see. we need to get you one of those plant misters. we can spray you like a fern.
oh, i'm really glad you called.
why?
yes.  a switch hitting witch. very common in puerto rico.
you don't need proof when you got instinct. i ignored it before, but not no more.
no.
not at all. what's wrong?
what was it then?
we're trying to repair doctor cochrane's ship. it's been damaged and --
do you have a girlfriend?
working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. you go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
no, sir!
what'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on?  sunnin' myself?
i'm afraid so. there were rumors ——people were aroused. some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
with what?
guy just pulls up out of the blue... i mean... what is this world coming to?
you're good at riddles... find the ring and the spell is broken.
you do?
damn.
did you want to talk to me?
i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king harald...
yeah, really.
till it's in a powder.  the energy exits within you...
you have to bring this up now? what? did i do something here? is that it? is it something i did?
all right.  what did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
now he'll be up all night...
yes, with these suits.  we've used them before on atomic tests... odd- looking, aren't they?
look, i'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
what?
i'm directing.
we're on our way home. i just...we're running a little late.
now.  i'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that drs. towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
a building?
you're calling me a crank?
i said we'll talk later, roy.  if you're what i think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
impossible.
we didn't kill gorkon.
well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
and then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to peking. agreed. send ngabo. is that all?
you need not worry...not just now, anyway.
this place is deluxe. you got cable?
i'll look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves.
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
we put out the word.  we'll start along the south side of the santee...
no.  uh, uh.  tell him i asked for it friday.  i want it friday. period.
i don't know guys... i mean, he almost looked... sincere. i know, it's bizarre!
you're afraid of the ferris wheel.
nona, please.
there's no doubt about it.  he's got his father's looks.  the kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  and smelly.  you stink!  it's just horrible.  you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled.  what's his name?
i'd like that.
what's wrong, jimmy? tell me what's wrong --
she'll figure it out sooner or later. i don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
i'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
we're not animals.
sara, this is doctor sheppard.  i called you earlier about a book.
i've never ridden in an automobile.
god.  you're a real live outlaw!
we promise.
oh, but it is.  he's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  that's a game.  it has rules and objectives.
i will continue with our french allies, concentrating on new york.
well, dawn, i'm an optimist by nature.
huh?
hers'n zodda meg a livig.
if it was any other brain but yours, i might agree. relax, this is going to be strong.
all i'm asking you to do is listen.  "the heavens made a girl named chris, with hair and skin of gold to touch her would be paradise to kiss her glory untold."
absolutely.
yeah, i'm cool.  see you later.
well, you don't wanna trust me too much. we'll take ned his share together so you don't figure i run off with it.
i'm not afraid of his words.
goodnight.
i thought you said the line was busy?
yes, sir. there are two in the veridian system.
i see.
seriously.
i don't need a tuxedo.
well, i'm not expecting anyone either.
when?
i think two million.
no.
don't leave me here to die -- theo, please -- you can't let me die --
no, sir.
yes, your honor.
ooooo, you are smart. just don't get too smart.
i'm infected with chimera.  you know you don't have a choice.  just do it now.
what is it?  how does it work?
it was clarendon.  he knew i had the gun in my bag.
mom, can't you tell him that i'm sick?
well, that's good, i have to get the kids off for school.  can i call you in a little while?
still, not sparkling.
ok, scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. they say it, but they don't mean it.
he's makin' threats in there.
you promised you'd never ask me.
poison gas...
i'll start with your news before i tell him mine, obviously.  mine isn't much, really, just about marie lasalle  playing at lounge ax tonight.  i like her, you know, she's kind of sheryl crowish... but, you know, good.  so i'll tell him before that. good news and bad news kind of thing.
your girl works in there ...
lily-- 
i bet.  that was our rent!
accounting, david, chartered accounting --
well that was our mistake then. and then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from woolworth's. i don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy.
what's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
i wanted to see the white horse --
oh. i see.
exactly. why don't you leave the guns behind this time? go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
fired?
anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
okay.  here she comes.
yeah.
and he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was.
i don't blame you.
soon as i finish the job.
they had their minds made up before i even went in there. they think i'm a head case.
six months.
pinta...
oh!  well, what happened to you?
no!
what am i supposed to do?  call him for cheating better than me?
yeah, come on.
with all due respect, sir, i think it's the best work i've done.
you should think about getting professional help.
what do you want me to say, gwen?... they wanted the commander.
yes. day... night.
you have nothing to fear.  you're safe again.
tomorrow evening, nine. east river drive and 73rd street.
yah, you bet. it's in the lot there. brand-new burnt umber ciera.
fifteen years ago?  it won't wash, pumpkin. no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. i wasn't born yesterday, you know.
well, i think it's very simple.  here's a tape of birdson's exorcism.  i'll be at the public library.  tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
don't move!
so does half of san diego.
very serious?
if i ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
37 usages of himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 tatum's, 47 riley's. and that's just on campus. it's hopeless.
listen--
we haven't heard from him.
how are the rooms? comfortable?
thanks.
nothing.
yes. i can do "swanee river." would you like to hear me?
then leave it in the past. old flames are like old tax returns.  you keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
it won't. are you ready?
hold my keys, then.
no, that's fine.  i love that you tried... time was i'd have done the same.
papers, sir. got it here.
a big one....
it's not the plaque. the winner can get assigned here as instructor. he gets to fight every day.
just give reed a little more time. you know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
you'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the spanish main.
do you know where i can steal some?
you mean until you showed up?
it's all hollow. nothing behind it.
but i wasn't sure you'd come.
hi.  what are you doing?
sure.
fuck me hard!
the critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - i can't see that either of lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
these animals are dirty, doctor. they stink, and they carry communicable diseases. why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
what is it?
hey, don't worry. you'll be fine, just . . . well, don't rush it.
don't love her too much.
call jane for me.  she's at the little thai place.
of course!
how can i?  no matter where i go, there'll always be a shell station on the corner.  i'll bring this back when it's empty.
jah -- you endorse his product -- he endorses your research.
all right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
you tell me... i want to know who's behind this.  who did this to me... how, why... ?
and you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
swap them? for what?
i don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  and, if he's popular with his men...
me, too.
this will do. 
i'm hanging up.
good-looking woman.
i do respect your mind! it turns me on! it makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! don't you see?
so who... who’s the man? where is he?
that's why we're only breaking one arm.
eat lead, coppers.
no.
just see how happy the people look... from here....
that if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
geller, this is way out of your league.
what are you talking abut, myra? marriage?
the fact that i'm right about your buckling?
i haven't felt like it.
you couldn't have known.
it was nothing.
that's not paul owen. paul owen's on the other side of the room. over there.
i've never been anywhere.  i wouldn't know where to go.  where would you go?
perfectly innocent! man have been hanged for less! i'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were holy gospel!
it's not all good news.  we had to take off the helmet lights.  you'll be going in blind.
toons aren't given imperfections.
i don't know what to say.
pardon me—
you ain't actin', mama.
arbogast said...
you don't know the bedside manner that man has got. why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. and even more important he loves me, like a patient i mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
a drink.
i have the password right here.
you need it.
i'm sorry i took you in there.
yeah, i'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on sunday. i have a terrible yeast infection and i need to see my gynecologist.
you mean that?
what did you think would happen?
come here a minute.
goddamnit, scooter, come on. pardon my language, ma'am.
i don't know... too late to stop it.
from her point of view or mine?
i don't care.  he'll never see me or know my name. if we find him, the police will have to take him down. not me, i'm just looking at evidence.
some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
how'm i supposed to turn this thing?
oh, hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
... garden sports, all.  little swing of maybe fifty degrees fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of embassy suit...
just fine, billy boy, just fine. full of piss an' vinegar! they checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
would you like to get some pie?
that's none of your business.
i don't know. we were planning on seeing the astrodome.
now tell him goodbye.
because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. they don't even like people in their 30's.
oh, my god!  ouch!  no wonder you quit.
see them two big trees across there?
when i said before that i hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, i was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
well, you know, that happens, on the street.
exactly.
how long have you been standing here?
you and the land are one. drink from the chalice. you will be reborn and the land with you.
i came into this world flat on my ass.
yes, sir.
we call him dough-boy cause he likes the dollars. he'll chase a buck straight into jersey.
died! seventeen times - not counting maiming.  shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
fine. well, that's all there is to it. are you alright?
it can be different.  it must be.
all aver the world.  they say he's spent half of his life overseas.
naw, they ain't stayin' here. but, i know who you're talkin' about. they're stayin' at the hollywood holiday inn.
live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
then that would be eating and drinking i'd live like a prince without thinking. the wisdom of old would be mine - a woman's much better than wine! then that would be eating and drinking! the wisdom of old would be mine - a woman's much better than wine. she's much better than wine! she's much better than wine!
well, fortunately, i know how to counter it.  the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
y... yes. i guess i did.
how's your war, mac?
it went to the goddamn fbi and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he could've taken off oswald at the morgue.  there's no chain of evidence, bill.  and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository?  one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser, described by deputy weitzman... maybe, just maybe, lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill - "a patsy".  take it at face value.  lou, susie, i'm going with my gut here.  he's got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle, "o.h. lee" to rent the room, right?  what's in a name, right?  in intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  a name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  then why can't somebody be using oswald's name?
the poem?... the poem was great!
what's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? look, hildy, i'm proposing to you. what do you say?
what if--
i just wanna go <u>home</u>.
really?  well, i uhhh...
because i was afraid.
i said i wish i'd never been born.
no i didn't see anybody i know. no i don't want to go to school here tomorrow. i want to go home.
it was <u>free</u>--i recall that was the chief selling point for you.
i can't go like this. can't you wait a few minutes 'til i'm ready?
i want to go with you!
so why follow me?  escort me, by all means.  following me is predatory, isn't it?
yeah, i do. a helluva lot more than i trust you.
she's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
mr. thomerson, i...
no... but what choice have we?
you say you killed a man and don't remember it. couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? it's sexual. why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
you don't know how true that is.
no.
yeah, i kinda figgered you'd say that...bein' a new husband and all...
you do.
you just did.
... alright.
who?
so there was money there!  who the hell's money is it?!
no! n-o, no!
are they any agent?
tuesday.
no...
aw, johnny... .
whose rooms are those?
i see. it's like as if he's going in a pattern. is that what you're saying, bill?
mrs. rand.
i thought i was very charming, stewart.
unless it's a diversion. milo's in my office. he was tailgating, so i --
in twenty-four hours, zephram cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in montana. if i'm right, the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
richter-we got a problem!
don't worry about a thing, sir. just enjoy your stay.
 no...
insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
i'll get you through.  move and smile.  and smile and move...
did you ever have a baby?
why are there two deeds here?
huh?
i'm so excited i just can't hide it.  i'm about to lode control and i think i like it.
kobayashi.
what are you, god?
did it give you advice?  good advice?
but what did you get on your sats?
before your time, pop.  mid-sixties.  five or six hits. he's got a club down in the fillmore now.
hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. i'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
you don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, diz?
but, joe - three weeks in florida!  we could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
no!
he set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
gregory ——  you'd better take jacqueline with you tonight.
will you stay here till i fall asleep?
those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
no. it's all over.
would that make you any happier?
that shirt?
well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
good. now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the chinatown shooting. we honestly don't give a shit about the kennedy assassination.
hiyah, john.  john, i want to have a little talk with you.  what's the matter—are you falling? come here.
muddy! sonofabitch! hold it. what's he payin' ya?
you should know how it works.  just in case.
believe you about what?
okay.
you can't help me, man.
doesn't it worry you?
i'm sorry.
it's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
i like to travel....
i don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
give him the money.
there's a shark....
it's miller time.  let me go give these koreans s'more business.
and you must be ringo.  look, darling, johnny ringo.  the deadliest pistoleer since wild bill, they say.  what do you think, darling?  should i hate him?
mister mcmurphy!
asshole.
tell me about it. i can't imagine doing all this and donovan's internship next year.
of course you do.  i'll stay here and pray.
just a scene i cut out.
easy. mr. jenkins. what job did mr. jenkins have?
a revolutionary approach to the theater. however, if i may a suggestion...
anyone in this office lives on their wits...  i'm going to be with you in a second.  what you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you? 
you don't hafta lift shit. you don't really work there. but as far as the records are concerned, you do. i call up matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. you're on the schedule. you got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. and ya know dock workers don't do too bad. so you can move into a halfway decent place without scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." and if scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. that day we sent you to tustin. we gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. you're at the taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
you are a virgin!
jim, i won't stand for it.
the three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. now as you know, we had no death penalty -
i can't understand it at all.
but, madame colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. i can straighten that out in two seconds.
when we knock off let's have a bit of a party. we'll drink to god and ireland, its whiskey and its women, to joey and edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
may i remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  so watch it...bill.
what makes you think we're more interesting?
we're losing the war, aren't we.
i bring her flowers too.
i looked all over for you last night, you know that?
joel, joely, look... it's not fading. the memory. i think we're hidden.
a small one...your brother won't be here....
so tell me.  where's z?
let's hope so. because if cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
what's wrong?
yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
i'm going to end it, alexander.  as we discussed...
i don't care. i want to get away from back home for a while. i'm tired of that shit back there.  look at this place. it's made of money. you know what the best part is? nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! there's nobody here to see us! everybody's back home.
in the village.  look what i found.
you all know me.  i'm one of you, i grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in yorba linda ...
you're wrong.
just no pleasing you, is there?
mary clarence!
i hope so.
you loaded it, vince! i saw you!
i, i don't want to see you tomorrow. mike's coming over.
a trip, you mean?
tell him i won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
that's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
even that would be an improvement.
only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
i can't.  i've got billy to take care of.
tell me.
who would do that?
i’m a hooker.
just reporters.
aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
no i'm not...
if it was my own mother, i'd carry on! you know i would. for the paper!
i don't know.
no, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
yes.
i don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. live now, pay later. diner's club!  why don't you grow up, baxter? be a mensch! you know what that means?
and still the film is number one at the box office this weekend. beat out american pasty and arlington street.
i can't help that. all i know is i got my orders. they told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what i'm telling you.
thank you, but i hardly think --
one word.  you won't find it in the phone book.
then what are you doing here?
the thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. nothing. i've always hated her for that.
that's sick!
it’s not about him. it's eric. he's alone out here somewhere. our baby is all alone.
of the woman in the mirror. would you know her if you saw her?
-- but he was concerned about the timing?
i'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
we gotta let the slack out, cledus; this is costing us time.
but you're not...you're not still here.
i can run out and get it.
kinda, actually, yeah.  i gotta admit.
i'm a homicide detective, remember?  when you see what i see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. i think you know about that.
i didn't.
who's they?
yeah, she said we looked queer.
that's my job. i'll take care of that. i'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. but i can't do anything if you go around talking to people. will you promise me to be careful from now on?
and for cleaning up oil spills.
it just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. there's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
don't be ridiculous.
...so accomplished.
well you tell him ta take it easy with that. he's gotta learn ta respect women the way connor does.
only if i want something bad enough.
it was brady's idea, jane. honest to god. please take the money. i want to make up.
i hope not.  now, as soon as you do what i told you, have plan-r radioed to the wing.
i believed her, pete.
be on guard.  mookie has pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
you're a monster.
...regression of modern man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
who'd you vote for?
well, then, from now on, i'm gonna start keepin' records.
...who doesn't?
yeah maybe you're right.
so you didn't come from the poorhouse!
no.
listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  we'll start a private study group.  nobody knows.  you'll ace that test.
oh, she's got a cold. she's in bed. caught it coming home from school. they gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
that's not a bad place to start.
certainly not, but i knew he had informers everywhere. even in my orchestra there was someone
when was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
oh, would you...?
what can we do?  you don't even know who this guy is.
maybe. i'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
you said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. don't you remember?
i'm a little tired, i don't know if...
so how long have you known eddie?
thirty-five.
anything good?
it's not myself i'm worried about.
be that as it may. u is for unconditional election. god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, the elect, and he has chosen them from the beginning of time. l is for limited atonement. only a limited number will be atoned, will go to heaven.
he's nuts about you.
you follow the law and do the best you can. it's all there.
i'm ready.
i could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  he lives on the whole top floor.
we can't.  those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
do you?
well, what, then?
stay calm, identify the problem. problem, rope fraying.  solution, fix rope.
i'm tired now.
there's no secrets here, al.
okay, i'll give here the message.
fuck off back to essex!
do you mind if i... ask you why you got divorced?
at least it can't get up here now.
diet and exercise, that's all there is. i'm not a big proponent of the pms craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "the pms diet," which may be helpful.
how could you?! this is just like home!
don't open that!
no. it's just my job to find him.  i was in the hospital after garrett jacob hobbs.
and church will be fine.
it's practically stamped on your forehead.
women.  'bout eighty percent female in greenpeace.
we went through the door...
wait a minute. wait. whatiya want? for cryin' out loud!
what do they say?
what i'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. i'd like to have them run some tests.
i'm sorry, sir, i apologize.  but if you weren't a captain, or if i were a major, what would you say?
what's it to ya?
maybe i thought i could do more good here than there.  i don't know.  look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  but, you're calling the shots, lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
for example, at this moment the film's out of focus. go see.
i can handle it.
wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
you were the last one i saw just before the accident. do you remember? we made love.
oh, okay.
do you wanna wrestle?  it's a good way of breaking the ice.  that instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
i can't.  the radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  but frank'll be looking for me soon. when he gets here i'll contact everybody from the chopper.
long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
ten to one, it belonged to cliff brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. right along the coast. isn't that right, thorpey?
i've been on my back two weeks. i'm sick of it.
that's another thing i can't do.
<i>i once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
building two.
okay, man, okay.  i'm with you.  i... i heard how the shit's arriving...  it's coming in a lincoln.
i'll get us out of here.
i need this?
i knew it.
... and me.  no, that's be me and me.  is that what i said?
anything?
want to? a million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
he's earned an early retirement.  but enough about losers; buzz fazeli is history. lets talk about your future.  i wanna show you something.
i found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
clarence, you do a good job with george bailey, and you'll get your wings.
i'd heard of <u>something</u>. the gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
well, all right.
what the hell am i supposed to do with him? take him to the zoo?
yes. it's very good, eve.
i been thinkin'...
and see when i get out of here. i've got plans. going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. see, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. no fucking problem.
like her paint job?
i had an appointment at his office, i think i must have got it wrong. we had a meeting...
i wrote a check for a thousand dollars. you guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
don't try to stop me!
you think i'd let you drive my cadillac car?  i ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my cadillac car.
let me think. i need time to think.
why did they built it?
i have my reasons.
you pick any girl for you and your friend.
too bad we all can't, baby... one thing about dell?
look, now, charlie, give me a big laugh here.
my name's david.
well, maybe he's sleeping.
why?
fuck pets. is this your partner? i had to come back and do the malkovich ride again. fuck everything else. is this her?
fron kon steen!
you want to start going over who they could have gotten?  they can't take on people like this for network news.  for god's sake.  what's going on?
no matter how many times i leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
not general korrd.
grounded? who's grounded?
this is good. little hints of clove.
same place we are.
nothing.
a night spent with the partner of my choice.
intelligent beyond our comprehension.
don't make fun of me when i'm being wonderful and supportive.  you belong on the court.  just like i belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
that's who people want to rent to. it's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... all we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
at the hilton. the girls asleep?
okay.
i'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
no.
farewell? you mean - you mean i'm -
really?
but john was with him at the pool?
that's fine.
i don't control minds. i free them.
to your husband.
why don't you hold your breath, instead? maybe you'll turn blue. on you that'd be an improvement.
they didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  they'll get him next time.
we wouldn't have met at all.
got a boyfriend back home?
surreal? strange? nightmarish?
maybe. i don't know. he has not asked my advice. if he asks my advice, i don't know what i will say.
you what?
diane takes care of the books. i don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
...you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  isn't that what you did?
alright, tom.
too little?  too little. okay, wait for me.
what are we doing here?
i think it might also matter to mitch.
yes?
man, i don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
now don't you go monk'ing--
you won't be able to miss them.  can't miss them.
what is it?
well, okay.  what's the big deal?  if she'll forget the new fireplace, i'll marry her. just point me in the right direction.
what?
jesus christ, pop, let's go home. i got waylaid. sorry.
the story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
i don't think of us that way - ever.
you look great.  your dad taking good care of you?
it was alive wasn't it?
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the french send war parties to raid their homes?
that cardboard headstone tipped over. this graveyard is obviously phony!
benjamin -- do they know you?
i swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. the best plastic surgeons in the world, ben. you had the best --
are you calling her?
i haven't done anything.
caesar?
six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
sam! no!
all right, i did, but i was in a weird place then.
er, my check, please.
it - it feels like - like i'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   like i'm fading away-
what is it you want from me?
you should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
it's how i hear it.  the display's just a little something i programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
the pattern.  each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole.  a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
that's what i keep trying to tell him.  you're so money, you don't even know...
yeah.
that's right.
his . . . whatever.
it's her home! it's where she lives!!
can i go too?
you caught that, huh?
maybe.  maybe with the crazy whites.
well good, that's very... nice.
i don't know... every once in a while i just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
kittridge is job.  max delivered.  how far is he from luther?
no. zey must have zem inside. we will have to dig.
well, sir it's not good.  roll the tape... the x-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
what?
i'm sorry, i can't possibly take them paul. i'm overrun with refugees. as soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
lili... i love you!
i wanted to thank you for covering for me. you're a real pal.
a bum. look what you're doing. you want to be brave? firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. you want to hurt johnny friendly? you want to fix him for what he did to charley— and a dozen men who were better than charley? don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. that's just what he wants. he'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  truth is the gun— drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
only rents by the month.  two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
party girls? can i call you?
birds are my friends. that sounds egotistical, but they are. birds know i watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
no.
yes?
two double whiskeys. was wunschen sie?
that's terrific.  that's really terrific, but i notice i'm the one that's cleaning up this--  oh, crap, i'll have to do this one over.
do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
he's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused frank to come and frank's fucking us real good. i just feel so horny. i'm supposed to be here watching you why can't i be here fucking you. listen. i know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
no, not at all.  sure.  you're right. you fly home and get some rest.
because i'm a professional liar. i spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  for my writing.
his nickname is "the hammer."
glad you like it.  my wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  joan -- that was my wife --
at the moment, very little.  your company at my table...
but now, you must go... i give you the pearls. but now you must go ---
and howls alison?
and your father was executed.
what are you talking about?
huh? but why did healy?
edward.  my name is edward.
i could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
how do you know? huh? when nobody knows that much?
so whatta you got for me, sport? why are you here?
where'd you go?
ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
something like that. but i'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
from a slipped disc? that'd be a first.
that's a good question.  what is it about fences?  sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  why would that be?
oh, i love that nose. it's such a sweet nose.
i -- i thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
what are you saving for?
you mean, while i'm here.
there's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
never been to maine before?
hey, you want to drive?
darlin', you ain't seein' santos again, are ya?
yeah.
boat nut.  what is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
yeah.
when i used to have nightmares.  i brought my friends in to help me.  until they all started dying.
it's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
no.
maybe she did, gus.  maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
nice try, old girl. i'd like to help you out. you know, for old time's sake. but all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and i haven't collected my profits yet. too bad. you caught me at the wrong time.
why?
right.  like last night's doozie.
try an angel.
maybe. but that's not the real reason. you think if i tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! me all to yourself!
on the morrow i'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
say what you gotta say, but i ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. not never. you hear?
go on now. do as i say.
...and for our supreme commander over here and our commander-in-chief in washington.
you workin' on another book?
who did?
me too.
what do you do, with the money you earn?
what's your problem?
but you talk about passion, about longing, about things i'll never know in my life! it's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! and then you tell me it ends like that? just empty?
he was born fighting. and born hungry.
we will separate -- you look over there.
hello martin. how have you been?
all right. send him in.
i've brought you something to keep you warm, mrs. stone --
-- but nobody has yet, donald. they just haven't been brought to that breaking point. they have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
catch you later freddy!
well actually i was born in siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my dad.
"i die knowing no one knew the real me."
sun will be down in a minute.
yes.
not really. i'd forgotten how long it's been since i've done this. and i couldn't get any parmesan cheese.
yeah.
i just couldn't sleep. i got up and went back... and then got up again. these last few days... whew!
i'm nothing then.
please, just a minute.
you're not a woman.
fuck me? fuck you!!
i am a fighting man and i am married to the quest. that is enough.
shall i answer it?
not very.
he's terribly busy, sir.
but i wanna write about her.
what more proof do you need?
two weeks, three at the most, aaaagh! for pity's sake.
well, i was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
but it was you that gave nancy her strength.  so to get out he has to come through you.  and it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
yes.
are you making an ass of yourself?
last rites, sister?
of course. i'm a traditional guy... it's a traditional event.  well, what do you think?
what do you mean, you poor ham! this is new year's!
someone probably said the same thing about the romulans a century ago.
more or less.  only for the end i've got a gimmick that's real good.
if you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
get the hose!  we've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
yeah.  i heard you.
okay. thanks a lot, linda.
why not?
what are you?
i know; this a long way from watts.  but what i like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  just peace and quiet.  listen.
call ya later.
thanks.
yes, shit. oops, sorry!  sorry. it's just i told myself i wasn't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it. like i psyched myself out.
when i'm in high school i'm not going to play any football. i'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  what did you do in high school?
you don't get it!  it's a big thing for them, it's like... caesar's palace. prime-time.  they're singing for the cardinals.  it's like... "star search." if first prize was a trip to the vatican. they've worked really hard, they deserve this.
now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. sid is going to evolve.
okay, okay.  listen:
i'm going too. they may need a doctor.
you don't understand sweety, daddy doesn't pay, daddy sees the show for free. but you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
can you knock?
late one night. about three. at the plaza.
marcus, get hold of sallah. tell him to meet you in iskenderun.
at least i was on our side!  look, they want me to testify?  i'll testify.  i'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  jesus, leo, this is my career!
wonderful - like a great release - he was a malignant cancer and i had to remove him - the world is better without him
then you get mom the hell out.  but dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  we don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
what about eric and dr. grant?
look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  no.  you're absolutely right, and i want to tell you something.
well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius.
a visual record, yes.  a before-and- after kind of thing.  this could make your reputation.
they are not.
well, look at the plus side.
you have no right...
i'm thinking of your man.
sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
well, see you at the berlin express.
no.
jumped where?
why?
i never like to talk about my work.
one of them is in on it. he might even be in charge. her security is in on it. there's only one person i know for sure isn't in on it.
i didn't see anything.
you do?
hush now. it's all right frank's here.
oh, okay.  here's let me show you.
yeh, it was easy.
are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
we reinvented ourselves.
what if i was a relative?
the poem! i knew he liked the poem!  billy prince is asking me to the prom.
did he mention the mayflowers?
macleod!
yes.
oh now this one is mine...
you promised.
but you've got to listen to me.
sally, our slave system is a british law...
carol the waitress?
now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
but why him?
huh?
i know that i've been... unwell.  i know it's been like there's two sides to me.
shhh. he'll hear you.
we're ticketed to fly back from baltimore, anyway.
no. i just got distracted. i'm so sorry.
what?
lubbock?
drink your beer and don't get so excited.
gee, i don't know, crabs...  improvise. you're good at that.
birds.
not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
where'd they go?
be careful!--they'll see you.
look, there's not much of a call for shakespeare in this town.
she lied.  cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  besides, junior cut the phones.
if you do the product placement...
wladek, please.
don't you think he trusts us together?
well, what do you want me to do, rita -- i can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  well, of course i know <u>you</u> can.  no, rita, i -- what was that?  -- oh, i thought i heard something on the line.
... it is called ss'jabroka'.  to us it is a potent narcotic.
did i buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
i didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. i didn't have time to get a window, but i found this key.  pretty nifty, huh?
that one -- how you gonna take him? they'll see him.
here.
what were you gonna say?  exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
like i'm going to pay twenty bucks to see neil moynihan in some band that i helped start.
what?
i'm going with you.
leave him, he's dead.
listen, it's late already when i realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and sal.  i couldn't get a baby sitter.
i'm dying.
the frogmen?
it's come to that, huh...?  three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
i know when to quit. you don't. win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
better keep moving....
what is this?  that's my money. you tryin' to muscle me?
you're not going to abuse them. they're all so sweet.
aha! i could sense the vibe.
cover...our footsteps...
bruce, i know, but i was in the biggest jam --
nearly a year.
i never use mine. but it's a good thing to have. just as a threat.
what's that, johnnie?
when i freaked out at the pub?  that was nothing, just nerves. don’t worry about it.
why not?
bummer, huh?  and friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
it's mine.  it means a lot to me. a barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
we have time.
they'll know when you go over to graff...
they turned you down?
i want to go to an east coast school! i want you to trust me to make my own choices.  i want --
dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? you don't even know the boy. if you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
the thing is...it really can't wait.
you men shoot, aim for the white meat!
wh-what do you think--
itzhak stern?  he's on the list.
he said to send you his regards and to tell you that the bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
moving them is one thing. killing them all...
all paved with diamonds and gold?
no ...
oh, that. listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
i've got a right to carry a gun if i want to.
we have to get off this ship.
you left your wife?
kill it, duke. it's got us all spinning.
you're butting in.
i beg you, doctor, don't make me say it.
so this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
what a shame.
god, you smell like whiskey.
yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
but you work for the casino?
is he dead?
i don't know what you could have read.
he just completely ignores me. he could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
i never saw this girl in my life.  is this a kind of joke?
okay, i'm goin'. you'll see, i'll get you.
working, thank you.
why what?
let it drop, bones.  you are my science officer -- i'll expect an <u>immediate</u> report on anything further you learn or <u>sense</u> from here on.
we need fertilizer, winston.
good, auggie. real good.  all finished.
look, you said you weren't feeling great.  i thought you should rest.
of course--everything they asked--
we'll lower a basket from the window ...
it's a corrosive gas.  on earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an oldsmobile.  at a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile.
i'm not snickering.  i'm smiling. because i'm happy.
i hear you sir, but i'm not leaving.
remember last night i was talking to you and i was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  do you remember?
harry, son.  harry.
i thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
what did you say?
they'll be wanting it back.
yeah. sure. yeah. we're on it bigtime. lots of leads. you bet.
keep it down, man.  i got problems.
uh huh. what about you? where you from?
what an excellent day for an exorcism.
i don't give a shit. that guy's got no right.
yeah, look at that thing.
what difference does it make?  it's here....
hell, no!  we don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  it might be dangerous!  what we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
just a girl, i work at magnin's --
so how are you?
tell it to hitler.
don't worry, we'll get it...
but they're so boring.  all small stuff.
wonderful. when your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. i'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
you speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
it's none of my business, but when are you and marietta gonna tie the knot? i always wondered why you never did.
 just give me elvis and i'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
okay.  sorry.  don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
does drew tell you everything?
no, i'm not...
that's right. a symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
this is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
but couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? the same person who planted it in cotton's car, framing him? the same person who really killed your mother?
i'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white v.w. van? you guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. could you tell me who's driven it recently?
that reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, i've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
wait a minute... what are you saying?
young blood
the left, i think.  those surgeons in witness protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
oh no. it is a sublime piece. the grandest operone. i tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
yo, don't sell all that. 'cause i'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at john k's. you're gonna bring it, right?
tractor beam remains constant...
ninety five percent?  just give me the money now.
not me.
that's the dumbest thing i ever heard. where do you sleep?
you're not my real dad.
just wanted to put him on edge...
if there's anything i can do, sir...
i did find it.  it was inside of agatha all this time.  so the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
all right, i'm on fire!  black seven, seven stickin' spades. let's go!
got it.
but i'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
'night, al.
c'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
frankly, yes, to my surprise.  he thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
maybe.  but what if he dies on the way back?  you see what i'm saying, sir?  the best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to caen and catch up with division.
baltimore. pure city-dweller.
john don't like him much.
that's fair enough, jabez. man's got a right to mull things over. we'll drive round again, week or so.
better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
i didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, dignan.
i didn't say it, she did. how'd you happen to get in that line of work?
you guys are so sweet!
a solitary vireo. i like that one.
my, my...
your dennis' kid.  i work alone.
to lunch.
who is it?
that's a direct order. you didn't see a thing!
your name, please?
well... thank you again.
it's already out.
oh, rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home.
git along little dowgie and call me back.
what?
but he knows that, sir...can't i stay, sir?
a doctor on the show... why?
tell me, who was it, set this up?
yes, miss johnson...
and where's jackie?
courtney? dinner?
hey!
no we don't. but that's where we're going. from minden we take a stage to reno, then another one over to auburn and another one to placerville. then it's a day's trip to sonora.
like cats and dogs.
they are little stars and birds. birds fly to the stars, i guess.
when is it?
come on, shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
it sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
no, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  okay, let's get a move on!  when are you leaving?
dishes?  we haven't eaten in three weeks!  adam, i'm not like you, i really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
right ...
but he could have killed everybody there. the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. the backdraft blew out the flame. that's it. that's the reason.
not if what he left me was real.
what happened? the pressure got to you?
what about veronica?
enchanté.  alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
did we want to?
and tomorrow i'll give one to somebody else.  get dressed.  get out.
but that one time --
forgive me, my wife, if you can. i was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. the fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. now once more i must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
all right!  where's the key?
i can't, i have to go home.
why didn't you tell me? why wasn't it in our files?
as long as he keeps out of the park.
that was nice of you.
i'm not bugging you. come and lie down. i'll give you a massage.  where'd you go today?
are you suggesting i call him master???
some -- somebody's father?
they are gone, louis. death took them. death which you can now destroy...
davis. i'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. but come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that i couldn't fully appreciate it. i wasn't fooled for a second. now, if you'd said price, or mcdermott...otherwise, it was amusing. now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. hilarious, davis. a killer.
and what would'st i gain from this bargain?
honey, come here.
--peaches! canned peaches!
no, my love.  i want nothing more of the dead.  i want you to --- chang me.
now, find your power animal.
your guilt is because you feel the same.
it's just -- fabulous.  think you could do anything for me?
no, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
what?
oh, absolutely.  bruce and i are very close.
i don't want you to see him outside school activities.
it's uh, it's down there somewhere. lemme take another look.
like what?
-- yes, teton sioux. father's side.
i miss her.
anything else bothering you?
jake. you can call me jake. here and there.
there's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here. besides, it'll be safer where it is.
yeah...
it looks....foreign.
what?
just get the fuck outta here.
i'm not sure.
i'm in it as we speak. [beat] you're haunting yourself right now. [beat] i guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. you didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, dr. becker. it turned out different, didn't it?
look, this isn't my kind of thing!  i wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! i don't do that! i'm a star!
don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
yes, i'm afraid i did.
like hell!
actually, mel does his own ass work. why wouldn't he?  it's delicious.
no!
i don't know.
just sending a message.  she'll get the point.
slink!  hang on!
what the hell is that?
tell me his name, dr. lecter.
this.
what john doe?
she's, uh, sleeping.
aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
stop calling me that! lampert's the name on the marriage license.
thank you.
of course you must keep control of your family.
the old man said, 'maybe your friend should give in.'  and when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. not only should you quit, you should run!
the american embassy.
smart for your age, eh? top of your class? tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
i'm afraid not. earlier this week, dr. evil escaped from zedel edel prison in baaden baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the electric psychedelic pussycat swinger's club in picadilly circus here in swinging london.
maybe it was more than that.
we need your help to overload the gibson so we can kill the da vinci virus and download the worm program.
antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. head split open like a melon.
the paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. hold it there. yes, there's more bits of paper in central services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and i couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27b/6.... bloody paperwork.
fuck that shit. pabst blue ribbon!!!
yeah.
the breath of god...
you've been very kind about it, mr. hunsecker. hunsecker give susie credit for that.  i took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  matter of fact, i'll have my say about smears on the show today.  that's why i'd like your personal assurance, too.
fuck you.
ma'am, i answered your question.  i answered the darn - i'm cooperating here, and i...
while you were in the shower.
we'll take it! will it fit?
i'm still five....
dammit, it doesn't add up!  ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswald's return.  only intelligence people can come and go like that.
they monitor reading habits.  not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe mein kampf.  whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the f.b.i. from then on.
aren't they precious?  ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. does she have any relatives in the area?
he used to run the nasa. he knows where all the bones are buried. comes in handy.
i didn't do that.
yes sir, boss paul!
and this is why you never told the d.a.
i allowed it to escape the city.
say, "thanks very much!"
that's only natural. maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
how you, radar?
he was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
well, we're...
he bows, goes. door shuts behind him.
i insist.  what will it be?  boston tea party clam chowder, or maybe the chicken red, white and cordon bleu? no...  there's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <u>roasted</u> <u>pig</u>.
remember my promise.
shut-up.
beasley's dead.
and what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
i... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
what's any of that got to do with paul d.?
at a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
visible panty line. max, she is gorgeous.
did you decide on a runway yet?
nah...i decided...i've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. i feel like gettin' into some real life...
why?
i'm willing to take the chance.
and the guy sent you a bill for this?
where are we going?
and failed.  these doors are solid steel.
yeah. it's pretty bad timing. where were you, say, ten years ago?
better. i found ryuji.
take the tape to the cops.
thel, listen to me.  if, on the million to one shot that i should--  that anything should happen to me.  would you take care of billy?
me?  why?
no...
umm.
help you out?
let's not get excited, sir.
three months.
uh, yeah.  cut to the chase.
amazing!  she still doesn't look over 20. when is she likely to grow old in appearance?
where's ken? is he all right?
who are you?
it's what i've been working for.
for god's sake, mrs. robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. you give me a drink. you put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
but first you have something to take care of?
i feel fine.
he's probably the only one who can help us.
five seconds.
yeah.
i'm now begging you.
yes. is this david?
i'm going to open it!
shut up! shut up your damn mouth!
as i said, in every way.  physically and psychologically.  more endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
what's the charge?
no.  i'm up.
that information's being withheld from the media.
what's our weapons situation?
yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
i'll take you with me.
what?
yippy.
nothing. why, whaddya hear?
who told you my name?
there must be a way! what about engineering?
did i say that?
who's watts?
mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. that could be her present...
what are you talking about? i am an anatomist. i know the body. i know how it works.
that's all the commitment you're offering me?  or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
they will!  you tell them if they don't come now, i will shoot you!
i know that, mr. gardiner.
i never said do what i do, i said do what i say.
as which point she drops to her knees in pain...
interesting theory.
francis did a thing for you today so i couldn't have you. and he was wrong.  i am the dragon!  give me your hand.
oh, don't get officious. you're not yourself when you're officious. that's the curse of a government job.
great story goober, how much?
... yes, i am, ben.
but one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the king's law.
oh, yeah. good for him.
we've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  you go get help. i'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad doctor.
forget it.  the boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
is it all fugasi?
no, it wasn't, was it? you didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
his parents? is that what he told you? his parents?
what we make it to? the next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
i'm telling you, i saw it...
bathroom.
seven pounds, eight, i suppose. why?
this is mike yanagita. ya know - mike yanagita. remember me?
so?  so?
watts.  those were his keys nell found.  his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to.  i think he's here.
yes! yes!
how about rapacious and love- starved?
you talk to him?
looks like it, don't it?  here's the woman, ma.
i was, because if you said "yes" right away, i wouldn't get to say this next part.  and i've been practicing it.  ready?
couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
ripley...
thanks.  so... do we talk about this... or what?
i'm upset too, zee, but jesse and cole know what they're doing. i'm sure they won't press their luck.
because bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. he's a goon.  james is the one.  he loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
whose orders were those?
what?
this is so weird.  it's happening, but it's not.  it's like a tv show, and we're part of it.
investigator...
yes!  just do it!
what? no you're not..
sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. i'm just starving.
i am very pleased to meet you.
to what?
the websters!
what are you doing?
we need you on the inside, my child. to report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
let's take a look.
yes, you are. you're protecting somebody. now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. it can't be as important as this. now come on, tell me. where were you last night?  come on, don't be a fool. matt, you trust me, don't you?
oh, hey man, how are ya?  i wondered if i'd see you again.
you're all wet. miss mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
fats, let's you and i shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
i'll say.
at least we know he hasn't got it. just keep nodding as though i'm giving orders. saavik, punch up the data charts of reliant's command console -- hurry...
not really.  just the sub-basement.
not exactly. as i said, this is some kind of-
one drop?
yeah, i'd say some weird things have happened.
yeah.  i meant... you know what i'm going to do with it?  i'm going to buy a sixty- three 'vette stingray.  all tricked out and cherry.  i'm going to be so sweet.
but i'm blind.
good lord.  what happened to you?
i would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. the odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, bacon . . . it won't win. so where is ed with all the bright ideas?
no, i'mma go on to work.  i don't wanna hear elroy's mouth.  now listen to me, craig.  it's gonna be different living over here.  don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  understand?
i don't know. it's getting pretty late...
take it easy.
wasn't it lovely?
gaiijin.
it disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  it's the only weapon we have against the machines.
don't worry. i'll respect you afterwards.
tramp.
shut up.
great. great.  so listen, uh, i was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
well, you go down beechwood...
yes, i'll remember. good night.
that won't happen again.  we're different.
fuck bastaldi and his brother. these tapes are gold. do you have any idea what zammito would pay to get them back?
oh, god, that would be something i really want to do.
can we stop for cigarettes?
motherfuck a window, radio raheem is dead.
i ain't got a warrant.
a little better.
oh, for god's sake, phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! are we listening to lionel now?
my wife wears a seven.  you don't look like a seven to me.
i dunno. one?
down at the station?
no. i'm ok. thanks.
can i help you with something?
my dear, i don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
i know, i built it.  i've just never seen it this way.
it couldn't be for that incident with burgel the other day.
how much do i stand to inherit if kirsty is presumed dead?
soggy bottom boys - i don't precisely recollect, uh -
89   continued:
glaser safety slugs?
what do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
here it is.
what would you like it to be to me...?  i, i, i can't invest in failure.
you must take your own life now, david, before it's too late.
i don't believe it.
they knew it.  time, distance, nothing could separate them. because they knew.  it was right.  it was real.  it was...
killaine's wise to what?
to rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  a little hypocrisy goes a long way.
right now?
i'm sorry.
and what, exactly, is your relationship to mrs. ryan?
what?
i made them, man....
yeah.  me neither.
we're almost done piping in directly to the olympia.  should have it all in about an hour or so.
shit...
you wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
well, you are!
thanks, brother. but the fact is, i gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
woody?  who's up there with you?
before she dumped him for steve.
i understand.
sure i will.
mom, i'm sorry.  i wanted to tell you. but it never felt right.
she was raped. at least that's what she claimed.
what are you talking about?
yeah.
you treat me like i was.
look, i'll call harvey tomes in the psych department, see what i can find out.
what?
what?
there might have been a word or two that slipped by.  maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
you could make their heads bleed, though.
she didn't write to me, did she.
yeah, cougar?
bogutude.  blow it off.
it's simpler, that's what. it makes things go faster.
little black party dresses?
what?
innocence. legal innocence. i know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
do you still have friends on the force?
oh.
a little place in los olivos. new owners. cozy ambiance. excellent food too -- you should try it. thought of you at the hitching post last night.
why call me?
i was gonna do something with joan.
do you... pray?
...the juice is climbin' every week.
and josé, my ace, lots of transshipment.  lots of action. skies are crowded.  and the jit has assets on land, air, and sea.  so any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
and that's the point, that we all have stories. the hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. it's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? don't call it new theater, charlie; call it real theater. call it our theater.
what the hell just happened?
yeah, all right, listen...
haven't you been watching?
what for?
of course, my dear. what can i do?
hotcha character. if i had to live with your cynicism, i wouldn't want to live at all. what you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
and who is "they?"
what makes you think i'd discuss that with you?
they're but off!  do something!
i said you were never a faggot.
well... dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
trying to have a relationship with you, max, is like standing in a fog bank.  you know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
vincent?
any child knows how to tell direction. any child. i don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. if you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
i'm not going to go, george. i changed my mind.
oh, sean --
her favorite poet.
good night!  sleep tight.  don't let the bedbugs bite!  that's what my mom always says...  ...who i'm really beginning to miss. i'm sorry.  it's my first night away from home.
whatever. but you... i get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. so why this?
i want to say something.
sure they did....
right here, why not? i prayed in saloons, i prayed in the street, i prayed an the toilet. he don't care where, what he wants is that prayer.
rug samples.
please! let me sit here. let me stay here with you. i promise i won't say all word. i'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. please, please!
i'm sorry.
but seem to have gotten lost on the way.
come along, they'll be operating shortly.  see you later, mike.
alright!  let's put it on film. camera!  sound!
duck!
i don't want you meeting around that house.  you stay away from those kids. and away from that dog.
santos... i can't...
i *don't* think that's the thing to do! no! i think what you ought to do is--*fight*!

they told me they don't help out stalkers.  look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
no. i'm just not tired. let's go.
i think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
he's inside you, where he hides.
hmmm?
nothing's wrong.  i just want to get something straight.  you agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point a" here...  ...to "point b," here.  now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
yeah.
why should you be?  my wife is a mental case.  please keep that in mind, miss connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about zombies.
i don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  i'm only with 'em because i'm running away.
that damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time i passed.
seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol del. on a regular basis, if you get my drift...
you want to book the flight?
i don't know.  but i'm sure i'll find out. rose, you did me solid.

i thought all for the best.
he never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
why?
the second r is silent.
okay.
please, jimmy.
listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? from people who do work?
we have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. what options? call the police.
i'll have some coffee, please.
oh, i'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  i'm real low on money.
you couldn't just hit her?

oh, but it's a good story, shadow. you're depriving our famous young friend here...
three minutes, 51 seconds.
uh-huh.
nursery?
what?
i need to tell you something, and i'm not sure how.
i finally knew what i wanted when i grew up.
because i can't afford it. and because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
you're more gutless than i thought.
how old is richard?
then our first target will be the initial landing place outside los angeles.
he's staying with a friend.  hurry up now, you'll be late for school.

well ya got me. that's me. i'm ben damon.
i don't know.  for me, i'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. there was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, i'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  she gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  eh?  what i'm saying, what is our life?  it's looking forward or it's looking back.  and that's our life. that's it.  where is the moment?  and what is it that we're afraid of? loss.  what else?  the bank closes.  we get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? none on 'em.  we worry anyway. what does this mean?  i'm not secure.  how can i be secure?  through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  no.  and what's beyond all measure?  that's a sickness. that's a trap.  there is no measure. only greed.  how can we act?

your family?  how can you ever lose your family?

yes, his girlfriend.
and i - what was i supposed to do, throw her out?
i'm afraid not, mr. president. the sub has positioned itself between the pierce and the soviet ships. admiral anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. the pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
but, when you fall asleep, i do things without you...
what the hell are you guys doing here?
no. no man. that's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. that's bullshit. i know these guys. i mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.

hello 
are you free tonight?
could you please do me a big favor?  in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  could you look and tell me what they are?
where did you get the poison?
no, that was in columbia.
barely.
she doesn't know, mrs. kane.  she just sent it - because i made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
and do you trust me?
so what are you saying?
that's comforting.
what happened? i thought we were playing truth or dare.
i'm sure i --

save 'em for the girl in gingham. just tell me i'm not good enough for you. go on. say a woman like me can't change.
they said i was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
-- yeah, banana peel, go head on.
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. he was engineered to skip thirty years of life. but since the rna sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. he's dying.
oh, did he?  what did he say?
not yet!
stark naked? you wish... if you're trying to seduce me, dr. jones, this is a very primitive approach.
yeah, i was emil's box-jumper for almost four years.

what's all of this got to do with me?
well?
i love antigua.  maybe i'll come visit you.
we've decided to go to montaldo's place. in fact, ettore should already be there.
no, it isn't -- where's the money?
well, i'm not saying that i want to join or anything, but...but i know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
we don't.
i can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. the very air that i breathe. the lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. all the beautiful things i see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  i've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. a crime, a great crime, yet i accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. why? can you tell me why?
i know, i need a keeper.
chicks are like buses. if you miss one, don't sweat it. there's another coming 'round the corner.
there's nothing i can do to help her.
goodbye.
i sure would.

trust me. this is bigger than tony pee-pants.
no.  so.  is it working out with ian?
are you drunk?
no, maybe not though. that, that's what i'm trying to say.
yes it is, cause then he'll give you all a's and it won't be fair.
he's got to have a car, right? we just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
oh, not much.  gates just had his tonsils taken out.  the hard way.
shut up.
i wish these people would leave already. i can't listen to another story. did you see him?  that doctor says the brain is coming around. they're waiting for the heart to stabilize. i don't know who to believe. he says they still have to keep him tied up.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
wait, this isn't fair...
okay, well that about covers it.
what is it, rico ?
should i?
we don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. besides...  you've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?

you touched him?
well, we could delete it.
i'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  anything but a talk with her.
a leader, like laszlo?
you met her family? they gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
how old are you?
little boy?!  that's him!
look dixon, calm down! it's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. and it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.

where?
well, yes.  groovy.
the wire is ten years outa date.

we got it.  on your feet.
i'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and i'll show you.
that depends on the man.
this is a man's game.  requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
"national priority."
you're a great man, mr. roth, i have much to learn from you.
oh, lord....
mac.  what's shaking?
you gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
i guess that's what i'm doing, then.

oh, oh, yes.  i-i-i-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
then he must have pulled her.
juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. there were never witnesses.
hell, no. but you missed a damn good sermon. "you can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the lord."
who are you, then?
jesus.
i think most people right now have other priorities.
no, really, mate?
how long's the job?
i work alone.  like you...  ...we always work alone.
i ordered it.  it's for your own safety.
i'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.

it doesn't bother me either.
no, no, no.  i have to talk to him.  if i can only call him..
ayegor!  find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
i'd be able to see something.
can i ask you a question?
i don't know, rose. i don't know where i've been, and i don't know where i'm going.  you should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
-- we don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
you've brought the federation into the middle of a blood feud, admiral. the children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. except ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
and you're all alone.
hey, don't be ridiculous.
'that right?
george!  so good to be back!
a friend of mine offered me a job here.
we've got a lot of people looking for us. we'd just like to go home.
sure.
talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot i'd remember
we're like his handlers. he can't function without us.
no, mr. white.  pierce morehouse patchett.  now, i sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all i'll give you.  if you persist, i'll meet you with my attorney. now, would you like miss bracken's address?  i doubt she knows anything, but --
how do we do that?  make a buy?  that went well...
watch everything? how? they are gone.
i'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  aren't these the greatest towels?
your good friend leo fast elk.
happy birthday, darling...
i mean it, let's get away from here, first joey then nolan, now charley— and any minute... .  ...i'm frightened— i'm frightened.
um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
she was... she was on the bed.  she was just sitting on the bed.

marge, you know dickie has i hate opera tattooed on his chest.
tammy curry?
the premium leads.  yes.  i know what they cost.  john.  because i, i generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  nineteen senny-nine, you know what i made? senny-nine?  ninety-six thousand dollars.  john?  for murray... for mitch...look at the sheets...
i miss you, mike.
maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. remorse. over the innocent people you've killed.
you're welcome.  dad?…would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
in seven years jackie's never missed one of tucker's parties. where is she?
you ever lose somebody stephanie?
wouldn't i.  just watch me.
i know that. but the buses don't go there.
your pop said to put these on his tab. sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.

shit!  our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  we got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
collected shoes too?
yes.  yours.  you haven't murdered anybody.  you killed mitchell. wasn't that an accident?  it must have been.  if you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
she took everything!    didn't even leave us cab fare.
beth shalom? it's reform.
our chance to do what?
jameson?  who are you trying to con...?
it wasn't difficult. only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone.  i see you brought along the female of your species.  i didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
yeah, i <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
what an old, old man you're getting to be, francis. weren't you ever a yellow? i bet you were even wilder than --  come on, sandman.
'76?
i am afraid of nothing.
what do you mean?
and my father?

a sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
mr. appleton, do you know an "albert lucas trumbo?"
you're a real heathen, you know that, jezzie? jesus, how did i ever get involved with such a ninny?
forget it, really.  i'll survive.
that's what i had in mind.
sometimes 76 or 80. sometimes i squeeze a few more hours in the morning. eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
that's good.  that's good, sweetie pie.
thank you.
this man, hawkins, has killed dozens of people. suspect zero.
as little as possible.
he is only curious to know who you are.
you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... it glitters!
yes.
good night, idiot!
who're you kidding? you can so.
few months perhaps. i'm gathering the raw materials even now.
go on talkin'. you're talkin' yourself right into the river. go on, go on... .
careful.

even the swallows are back.
look, mrs. dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. i'll wash the dishes and --
like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
it is a big deal.
jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. your methods won't do here. this boy is a senator, however it happened, he's a senator. this is washington.
ynyr!
because i'm the one who's single.
no, no. see - they, no, see, they only deal with me. ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
i knew. i rescued you, didn't i? from the terrible dawn.
i'm your doctor and i'm your friend, jim. get back your command. get it back before you really do grow old. before you turn into part of this collection.

sollozzo and mccluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on times square, under the big camels sign.
yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? i mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
no.
yep...  yes...  it is.
only if you really, truly mean it.
then i'll leave thee.
oh... well, i'm very sorry...
not unless you can fly.
sad commentary, huh?
i'm getting dressed now.  i'll be over.  bye.
ok, so maybe i was a little over emotional.
i'm scared.  i'm very scared.
thanks.  thanks, pal.
i can't do that.
my brother's in jail.
by the way, jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
he's going to pop!
let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. they're portable. they're controllable. they're eager. and they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
come to think of it, i haven't been very pleasant for weeks. for that, i'm truly sorry. more than any two people i know, i don't want you and lloyd to be angry with me...
why?
yeah...?
don't you read shakespeare?
i mean, it's there, reggie. if only we could see it. we're looking at it right now.
mr. treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
what's that, peanut?
... deborah ann kaye ...
goodbye, darling!
don't worry.  you won't even see her.
what are you going to do?
bree, what's actually happened? it wasn't that bad.
i'm exhausted.
i could give you a false name, but i won't.  just call me x.
because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
so, that's good, right?
ninja falcon zord!
naw! he wouldn't have cared. just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and i've got a feeling you'll do just that.
no, we're paying for the wine.
you're a great architect, albert.
no.  why?  i like to be with sam.
a few cops.
by the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. we'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
he's gentler than i thought. and he has a sense of humor.
you think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
i know everything about you, diana.
by "they" you mean...?
i thought you didn't recognize me.
you'll have the money.  how do i know that you won't --
no! i -- all right, look, if you hear from ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
we shall say ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
i didn't say i'm going to die, but if i should--
i want to talk about the baby.
sound good to you, danny?
oh, you do?  with all your legal expertise, you believe that?
yeah.
if you hadn't been gassing about hoagie....
that's funny.
this is a good one!  shut up, everybody! listen to this!  'the president of the united states to harry shapiro. greeting: having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' what do you know! so now i'm a draft evader!
we cannot write our destiny, macleod. in the end it could be you and me.
oh... "i love you... i can't believe you're doing this... drugs are bad..." whatever. after-school bullshit. the role is brother.
it is a difficult situation.
dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  we're clueless, you're tired. why don't you go home and get some rest.
you live and learn. i realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
it's about life.
i always assumed hamlet meant death.
frances?
of course. yes.
don't hurry back.
three years.
you wish!  i nearly scored with that little blonde.  i need me a short little queen.
great, bye.
if she was his wife, she should have all the money. that's only fair. i don't want a penny of it.
good!  keep going, now.  the cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to hot town. green lights and white lines all the way.
who gets killed?
as far as i can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  all he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
fifty cars. fifty cars by 8 am friday. or kip goes in that box. that was the deal ... goddamn, it ... that was the deal ...
it was a long time ago.
evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
no, but thanks for the warning.
i tell you one thing trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
i'm not going to let this baby die.
soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
look, fuck the border. let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
i was appalled, just as you are now.
hold on, alice.
i know you've been trying to kill me.
yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
stop pressuring me...
after our hero had killed wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  he realized that he and julia could still collect money.  wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay, signing wynant's name, so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia.  he even telephoned macaulay --  do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
that's my stuff from the office...
holy cow.
i'm not much good at handwriting. or parties.
very interesting, even to a layman.
i didn't guess until it was too late.
you want it straight? medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
yes. mr. buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. he's in the hospital. how about it?
i am.
oh, i am.  later..
where's corbett?
look, i feel bad about this, so i'm going to try to look into the programming of his maestro teaching tool for you.  ) i've had one sitting around for years. maybe i can learn something that you'll find useful.
what happened to him?
i left three messages already.
hey, now -
worst case, it's a bloodbath.  the detectives come out with smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass go.
well, lemme sing the one i picked an' see what you think...  "when there's a fire in your heart/break the glass/sound the alarm..."
no. tell me why.
it ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. i got the i.d. on this armitage character. he a bright boy, your friend?
clark . . . wait!
no, sir.
yeah, but i...uh--i thought you needed that.  when-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
m-e...
'bye, jocko.
the orangemen!  now there's a football program.  jim brown.  and that other tailback ... the one with the blood disease ...
easy morg, don't think about that now.
don't worry, i'll settle up with your boss. we haven't skipped town yet.
you don' t need to know that. it's none of your business.
yeah... well...
the infirmary?...
make a pass or something. isn't that the way it goes?
you're wrong.  everything we do leaves its mark.  you said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
three years, john.  is that not a bit long to be grieving?
no... no... no...
cole and munoz are going in the back door.  babbit is backing me.  so i want you at the side window by the hedge.  you're strictly backup, got it?
you wanna go to paul's house?
if i was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't i go deal with this guy chigurh?
well, stop the world.
what the hell are you talking about?
oh, i get it; i'm dreaming!  and this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
son of a bitch!!
uh, atomic energy?
hope i make it through both.
put him under the table or i'll stop her from coming in.
his horse.
forgive me. it is not here. i assumed he had mind-melded with you. it is the vulcan way when the body's end is near.
nykwana wombosi. 
did you tell that to marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
yes, ma'am?
i think it's an energy form, sir...
jeffrey nothing.
what are you doing here, melorra?
you're a little boy and you like to be bad.
i will not.
oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? that's it. you're out of the cool crowd. next time turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
it's a strange hobby. curious, i mean.
who else could have used that key?
oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
who's this --
why?
what is it?
hmm.
why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  the people have bread and the city is quiet.
but i'm afraid of--
-- last night we said a great many things. you said i was to do the thinking for both of us. well, i've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. you're getting on that plane with victor where you belong.
a hundred and five years?  he really hung on, didn't he.
what about the shit they write?
make it on his own? does he know the kind of money involved? i mean the real money. he thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? we're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? a nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? is he really crazy? listen, joey, you understand, you tell him. i don't care how great he is or how colorful. he could beat all the sugar ray robinsons and all the janiros he wants to. he ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. i'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
but you didn't do that.
[o.k. so tell me more.]
i'll be careful, darling. you be, please.
are you sure?
yeah?
fine thing jim taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--i need this job like i need ten pounds.
i don't know what that means. i'm talking about not rocking the boat.
here are two quarters. when you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
"a warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." nietzsche.
mph rmph rm rmph rm.
thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
up on the coast. about sixty miles north of here.
i don't know what's going on.
everybody's got some, i guess.
daniel! ... you must go to sleep.
so i want you to keep a clear head.
all i told them was the truth.
'predate it.
where?
he don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  do you, boy? ah, many's the time poor brother ben told me about these youngins.
i wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
look lady, i appreciate you saving my life and all, but when i signed on, i agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and i did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
that's what you do. that's why we need you. you have an insight.  you know monsters.
hi, everyone.  i don t think we've met. i'm sam coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam.
because i guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. girls like mary don't stay single.
i would not be too sure.
does that mean that the bath is my own? --- private?
did i say anything?
what kind of trouble -- ?
turkish? oh, if it's turkish, that's different. i want to be in it.
act.  here we go again.  reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  what if we have some, you know...like, calling?
it knows us. this one knows us.
well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  i mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  they're like --  -- the mighty oak.  it's not a look.
that's necessary, huh?
until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
you're a ringer.  she brought you in to replace me.  out with the old.
mrs. kintner must've put her ad in field and stream.
i don't know who they are, or what they are. but they're gonna get me and i'm scared, jake. i'm so scared i can't do anything. i can't go to my sisters. i can't even go home.
ten seconds, rod.
your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. says they'll send you up again.
well i can't say that walter!  she's incomparable.  they're both great.
they'll get in! we'll all die!
... you worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
where is she?
okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
shut yo' ass up.
no. i was calm.
yes, of course, i would.  you know i am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but i certainly know nothing about this.
don't get upset!
what for?
we got five. putting ashley outside.
on speakers.
he's just pushy.
now you're using your head. for all we know, he's the rat.
she's at school.  we've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
no...
i don't know. something's missing.
my brother, tom hagen.
you better run out to the house. she may be... unable to answer the phone...
i will be there in five minutes.  go back to your guests.
i’m afraid i have bad news, mr de moraes. i have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
lancelot?... it is lancelot!
she has died.  you are the next to be called.  why do you think you were sent to me?  trained as you were?  you bear the mark.
frank galvin's ... who's calling please?  bishop brophy's office ...
he leave you?
about what?
he won't do anything for me, but for you --
all i did...
well, i couldn't be happier for the both of you.
no -- i will.
what do you propose?
wanna be a part of history?
fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. he just wanted to fix their cars.
"environmental concerns", again. an android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
how do you mean?
wow, you're right!  us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  coulda been a disaster.
yeah.
we bring her in for questioning.
is that everybody?
i . . .
well, er... let's drop it. i don't think you would care for that one.
you got a brew?
no. and you have to be.
more proof god's a guy...
montgomery clift, wait 'till i tell shelly.
she knows you real self?
go home!  show them how rich you are for a change!
no, you believed her, we drove all the way to l.a. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? huh?
um-<u>hum</u> ...
it was my fault.
what do you mean?
yes.
they're enormous! a new species created by man's recklessness. that's what i've been trying to tell you, i'm only a biologist. i take radioactive samples and study them.
i know i'm your hero.
no.
look, tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
nothing. tom, i thought you were going out with me tonight.
hey, what i did for you is working out?
mr. jones is dead.  so are two of his men.  the other three are in jail.  i have the disks.  i have walter smith. and you know what, you motherfucker?  i have you.
the scum of the earth.
we always knew you'd come to us, louis.
the sword of damocles is lifted from above seth's head. he's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. he knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
you don't think i put something in it, do you?
he's right.
he remarried. apparently they were having an affair for years. apparently the first mrs. delaney was a bit of a stiff.
i'll see you, then.
if i talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
nothing doing. this is my percentage. you birds are going to get yours. and anyhow, i found this dump.
me? no - most ordinary guy in the world, me. only one thing wrong with me—
and two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  frank, i can't sing that fucking song anymore!
harry, are we gonna build this thing or not?
you think i'm improving?
our father, montcalm, is greater than the yengeese in the arts of war. the huron do not fear english anger.
is everything ready?
what expenses? all you need is carfare to long island. you'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
in the corporate offices.
ladies first, troy! that was close.
and if you're wrong.
what's mezzaluna?
daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
94   continued:  
you bullshittin' me?
would you, mr. phillips?
you know i don't like these tribal rituals, freckle face.  i'm interviewing clay shaw this morning.
gee. i don't need to. you're a natural. you should sign up with my modeling agent.
isn't it true that you --
heil, baby!  i just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
we'll have to go after them.
could use a dash more jet fuel.
audrey, thank you for coming. thank you.  i'm sorry to be such a... such a... thank you.
you wanna get up? well, you've gotta you see... well i want you to lick it. go on... lick it. alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
where's mom?
then - would you talk to mr. fabian about it?
see? right there. just what you just said. that's beautiful. a thumbprint on a skyscraper. i couldn't write that.
i think you're in anaphylactic shock --
i looked for you in my closet tonight.  it's crazy, i don't know where you came from but. i like you.
a grill pattern.
what was it like?
all right.  it's a beginning.  las vegas, nevada.
i read the file.  yeah.  marx and towler.  i know who they were.
shoot, doc, the only one i'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. that's all.
you're crazy baby.  i love you.
whoa, check it out.
sal's alive???
ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. my boy was taken from me... far as i'm concerned, he's dead. now, i ain't gonna ask you again. -- who are you?!
that's the guy?
i was afraid you weren't gonna come. we haven't got much time.
well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog dna to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  they mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  now, some west african frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  malcolm was right!  look, life found a way!
where are you going?
and i know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
looks like today's your lucky day
that's the power source that was lost from argo city! that's what i came: to find! where does she live?
i thought i smelled gas coming from your apartment.
i just hope this yutz can pull it off.
it was. really a shame. to go so suddenly.
then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, mrs spitz?
and if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
you've always had hostility toward david ever since i mentioned him!
kill you? hardly that.
it was an accident.
mrs.  otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  the word doesn't mean anything to me.  as far as i'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  that's what's done, mrs. otto.  i've seen it happen so many times before.
i don't know. depends. i'm in a bad mood.
you shot her twice?
worried about me! well, you just stop it!
it's a long story.  right now we gotta do somethin'.
what if it never happens?  what if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- this place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
ain't that the sweetest thing. what am i supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
what about your toe?
...as soon as andy got back home, nicky heard about our talk in the car.
fuck you, mr. kane.
then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the greater world...how pleased am i to see you looking so well...
alex, what are you doing?
shut up and let me in. you ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
- you got to be blonde -
trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. you couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
really?
well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
i don't understand. what's happened here?
no, sir. i haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since i've been back...
i believe you! don't worry.
because you love me -- you love me?
that is not an "option." there is no multiple choice here.
she didn't take my name when we were married.
please! will you just --
we've certainly been in some swell jams.
it would be worth the risk.
tomorrow. we're late for lester.
i don't think it's working.
that would be murder, mr. deckard.
judy barton.
well...
i'm on my way to get a haircut.
if you don't calm the hell down i'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
no, boss! i won't. i won't. i got my mind right. i got it right, boss. please don't hit me no more.
can't you have a normal conversation?
no, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
immediately.
you asked to see me, ma'am?
a flop, ha!  that's putting it mildly.  a disaster!  a catastrophe! an outrage!  a guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
are you sure?
maybe we can catch it.
i'm so sorry.
you're dreaming, willie. you want to make it real, just knock on my door.
you seen john brigham...?
don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
good thinking.  what's all this?
you can't bluff me, burns. i don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
during the time i cooperate, will i be outside?  outside a jail?
i think so.  although i believe that to be true of a number of germans. might i have a glass of water?
i have to reach him. this is an emergency. could you give me his home number?
yeah, i did.
yes, we know that you do.  i have it in my files.  that's at the manhattan health center...
i don't understand.
sure know it wasn't me. and if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, evelyn?
no...you idiot!
your mother thought he was a good man.  he worked very hard.  what i remember most was his manner was so... slight.  it was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
that's what i told her. if she could just see him a second, then i could take her home.
what things?
where is luh?
jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. we're totally committed. it's time to brainstorm.
activated.  vertical drop checked. correcting course.  on tangential course now, orbiting.  crossing the terminator.  entering night side.
okay, louise... it's okay.
i'm gonna do somethin with it.
oh, it doesn't, huh!  you got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
i would have anyway.
blow me.
so? that's logical. you see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
oh, so that's him? the panda man.
that's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
"and though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
i don't see why. i'm twice as old as you are. how could anyone think --
okay.
that's going to cost.
i'll watch.
okay.  and what do you love? say everything.
gloria -- i've waited for years.  i won't be put off!  i love you!  i want you!  can't you see that i'm at your feet?
matter of fact...
not very long.  there have been a couple of bids already.
what?  that he knew johnny roselli? hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
then we got'em!
oh, of course. what is your name?
i like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, i enjoy a warm cup --
fuck that, we've got company...
i swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff i think i ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  rafe was...he was lonely.  he had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  the week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
he wants you as you want him. he's been waiting for you. he wants you for a companion. he bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
come in.
yeah.
what's up?
yes.
to my room and then i went for a walk.
put your tiny little mind at ease.
oh, yeah, tell everyone i'm crazy. beauty ida.
yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
sure.
okay.
it's a secret.
can't help it. you're doing time for me. no greater love, as the man says. wish you'd tell me why.
don't talk about it much, though.
why do you always answer a question with a question?
i'm pulling up right now. evacuate the fucking van! plans have changed! <b> ext. texaco station -- next
and when he got serious?
and what next?  popcorn?  curtain calls? this is not a theater.  or a casino.
i can't get it!  i can't get it unless i move!
what's going on?
there are some things, my dear conway, i deeply regret i may not discuss.
what if he's dead?  what if you killed him?
no, she was crying her eyes out.
so you really liked it? yeah, there's some really rare performances. you liked that memphis minnie, huh?
yes, shaking hands. i don't take a very good picture, though.
i'm certainly not going to swim across.
i think so.
a-okay.  got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  i'm ready for action.
long as it's fun.
beautiful but so sad. i did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
so you're saying she moved out.
thanks, mick -- i'm gonna try.
hal, i'm going out now to replace the a.o. unit.
shut up.
sometimes they do.
i believe they will deport you.
counting the gray hairs in your head.
don't worry. she's good with kids.
but mr. norman said --
so those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
okay.  all aboard - new york, new york!
blue'll git him, boss. we'll git that bastid, cool hand luke.
did i?
he's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  don't worry about it.
giancarlo... rinaldi.
of course i shall say what i have to say.  i always do.
good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  part of your education.
what is this place?
the united states.
look -- you may be a big yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as i say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. now get down here!
orange, new jersey.
you got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- we don't know how bad it is -- the guy ripped the phone out -- swat said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. if swat makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. i gotta go in. maybe i can see what's going on in there.
you have a boyfriend?  of course you do.
people say that?
do you mind if i ask why you do that?  it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
and then --?
i know.
well...
what am i?  the fall guy?
i have to be simple again, swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. i've thought it over and i'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
oh, um, like famous quotes. i find reading them inspirational to me. and in my reading i've come across some i thought you might like, too.
what difference does it make?
sartorius.
nice speech.  what's it supposed to mean?
here?  in this house?
brian --  -- see ya tonight.
yeah, i think i gotta get these fixed or something.
evelyn, put her to bed.
yeah... there's no straight lawyers in turkey... they're all bent bent as hairpins...
i'm sure you're overreacting.
can you make him stop!
the loneliness? lonely with all your gold, mister stevens? that hardly makes sense.
not bad.
but it doesn't make sense.  they - they used lasher...  they conspired with him.
old man delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
hello.  so very boring.  peter parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
you stupid bastard!
darlin', i'll take a taxi to the hotel. you and brother can handle the girl's epizootics. i'll just say one more thing.  rose, i told you you had a friend in mrs. hillyer, didn't i, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
was your family traveling with you?
did you not hear me? we can't give out no information.
suits me.
thanks.
hey, excellent.  thanks.

peace is made is such ways.
yes, i do.

we've never met.
that's the idea.
no, indeed.
i know. i wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
apparently, gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. she said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
i'm just tired in general.
yeah, you met her?
send oona up above the tree tops. she be our eyes.
no, please! i just want to talk to you!
of course.
where are your headquarters, rebel? tell me or i'll let you hang there forever...forever!
and not too expensive.
dude, i'm sorry--
when?
how tight are these shafts?
all deserts have water, somewhere. god shall lead us there.
mr. vanderhof, in public relations, and mr. eichelberger, in mortgage and loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
i gathered that.
why?
it's not funny! i mean what am i gonna do? without that yearbook i'm lost. i can't just walk around town looking for someone with a wilson high school letter sweater!!!
yes...
there're no cars on this street.
what i was afraid would happen. the stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
uh-huh.
i'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. i think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
one chip?
be the swallow.  be the swallow...
they will know you helped us, if we go this way.
i'm the stenographer.
i wish i knew, edie, but— 
john ultrarelamensky.
yeah, but i'm okay. i've got some work to do.
c'mon, lee.  he's going to jail.  you won, now just put the gun down.
yes.
oh, good -- well, i hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
and suppose a little old lady lives there?
it's the gestapo. they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow.
put a fork in me harry, lets get started.
you have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
what?
they're all fine.  just bruises and shit.
right!  where?
not long... a few days.
open the bolt!
there's still a patch of blood there on the road. did you see it?
look at this, everything is different down here.  all our furniture is gone.
jesus, i don't know, baby, i been cutting too much hair lately. i'm losing all my concepts...
where were you?
i'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  hi there.
my office?
oh god. what hospital?
wow!  french toast, really?
just a waitress.
two or three days! while lyssa is in their hands?
so do you.
i'm so happy you like it.  i'm so relieved you said yes, and i'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
really.
your mom.
i cannot betray my bride.
i'll just have to try harder.  i don't know.  i will.  i will.  i will.  i will.
marvelous plane.  did you look?
mind if i change the station? better traffic reports on am.
you shouldn't watch such things, doll.
they’re german jews. came here before the war. they both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon. it’s not guilt, more of a curse...  and then there’s something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters... but i think that’s just one of leon’s dark delusions...
i know what day it is!  get off the phone.
yes?
well sir, i'll show you.
i just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
what's that?
well, no, johnny, i just thought i should've been told if—
that is what you must discover.   see what i am, my love. with all your power - see me, and know what i am.
mm-hm.
and now?
"what sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. what fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  not knowing that we are nothing.  we are not what was intended."
he's a pussy.
will that help?
i just don't want natalie to ever find out.  she deserves better.
really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
we can't leave him out here, open the door.
what?
right!
don't you see...
suit yourself. but i'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. under the authority vested in me by the president, i'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
what's that, like a p.o. box.
you apprehended him after he gave himself up --
i have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
we're staying in <u>tents</u>?
it's a question of habit ...
approach control... this is enterprise. ready for docking maneuver.
what else? what kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
what other reason could you have come? a captain. ranger. paratrooper. graduate of the recondo school. am i right about these things?
i love this car. some cars sit, you know? this car, a car like this... grows. i mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
i can't remember the lines!
never mind, papa, it doesn't matter now.  she loved me once.  i want to die remembering that.
we can shrink an army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. that's why we call it <combined miniature deterrent forces>.
no, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. allah has given you a great gift. use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while he is all.
hurry up!
just a hunch.
don't do it, norman!
yeah, i'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  this is important, you know.  this is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  the century?  forget it.  <u>history</u>.
i can't, i have no idea how he's doing it.  and that leaves you trailing, jim.  you gotta get your act together.
what?  what was that?  something funny, miss swann? share, please.
i'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
it's in my room!
pipe down, brain lady!  and you...
everything that's been missing.
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. the world is a hologram, albert.
they cancelled it. why are you acting like this?
oh come on. price. there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about. sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
the airport. trying to get on the plane for the states.
they suspended me.
get the fuck outta here.
yeah, right.  by the way, as long as i'm getting things off my chest, i'm the one who killed your little monkey.  made it look like a mafia hit.  did it for fun. ciao.
and maybe pass arbogast on the road?  thanks.
maybe we can stop there for lunch.
sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
little ones.
theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  it may not come back at all.
no, i'm more furious. i'm pissed off. i feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  he has his friend do it for him!
take it as a compliment. geesh.
you don't think he was a hero?
it does.
thanks. i like it when you say that, sam.
i promise, my dear, i will give the matter some consideration.
just that i'd talk to my superiors.
truth'll set you free.  i'm listening.
i need to know how skynet get built.  who's responsible?
now, judy, it isn't anything to get --
i'm serious. this is how you do it. i'm telling you.
uh huh.  and i said, 'that's good, because i like the feeling of someone watching me.  i acquired the taste from lenny.'
well, you did invite me here.
remember the message... the future is not set. there is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
receiving.
yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with john bubber.  the whole country, in fact. and they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  look at me!
yes. it's very cold outside today, isn't it, thomas?
i'm real upset about what you wrote.
are you hungry? i have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
they are in tune.  but not with each other.
can't do it suits. i can't lay down for this one.
and yours.
why don't i just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
he's a big one. you two tight?
o.k. thank you very much.
he's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * cut from completed film.
no.
we're both of us damned, my beauty.
last night he proposed to me.
how do we do that?
how about me?  do you think if i concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day i might be a putterer?
yes, yes...
good, i hate long waits.
twice.
mr. robinson?
well i don't want a damned thing to do with it.
they're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
no.  as a matter of fact i haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
i don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but i don't think it was me.
what in sugar hill's the matter with him?
your money's no good here.
he's a nigger.
she said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
you know that girl i told you about. the one i love.
she says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
was he?
what? whatta you mean, no? who is -- who is telling you? whatta you mean, no? yes, you'll wear pink or else. or else you'll wear pink.  and, darlin', oh, i'm gonna take you to coney island.
those are sarah lawrence guys, patrick. you're making me feel weird.
i mean, there's no instructions--  what do you mean, they're not tricks?
53!
well, are you?
surrender!!
what i don't know, i can learn and what i know, nobody can teach. excuse me for saying it about myself, but i think it's true.  what do you think?  never mind what you think.
i've had time to get over it.
oh sure. for the first hundred years. then it starts to get a little monotonous.  sleep well.
the creature!? are you sure!?
by what name are you known?
i don't believe it is, no.
shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
yeah, but... you know what i mean.
yes, there was a man with you... she brought you here... she didn't know what else to do.
and-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
you better get some fresh air.
i'm twenty-seven.
dude.  that's my sister.
i just wanna kiss, that's all.
'course not.  strictly business.
leave the rifle here.
in here i am.
you know ...  what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
yes.
it's simple. bastaldi's moving up. he's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
simple, numbers.  every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. we lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  i'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  that's over three hundred men.  maybe five hundred.  a thousand. then thousand.  any number you want. see?  it's simple.  it lets you always choose mission over men.
... it's time to get this society back on track!
who's that?
i am. eddie -- we've got nothing.
pop!
i'd like that.
california.
do you have visual?
all he's gotta do is read.
...like macaroni and cheese...
i thought you’d never ask... as i was having my coffee and crescents at the mondrian the other morning i spotted your photograph in the los angeles times... there’s a tough lady, i thought. just the kind who might help me...
no. i can't. not yet.
no!  <u>doctor acula</u>!  you can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  not a count.
don't you fucking knock?
some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
missus fusari, missus canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  you ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? you don't wonder that?
you think i fear death? i welcome it. i get on my knees and pray for it. you, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  she’s beautiful isn’t she? you should have seen her before. flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
no clubs.  i wanna reach the top!  carnegie hall...!
no, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  i grew up here, and i know my way around the studios.
no .. but we have a theory ..
for how long?
yeah.  well... i gotta split. goodbye's make me crazy.
i think that's it.
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go.
you just did.
just a few more minutes. it'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
there's two ways out i figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. the other way is under.
for four fucking grand?  one palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
this is the phantom zone. but why did you come here from argo city?
i ain't pissing nothing away--i got a porsche already.  a 944 with a.c. and a quadraphonic blaupunkt.
calm?... he doesn't seem so to me... he was awake all night.
why d'you think these seats were empty.
congratulations on the deal.  how exciting.  is sally doing sally?  i mean it's sally.  the character that's based on sally.  the character that's based on sally in the book.
what's that?
i'm terribly sorry, mr. de mille.
we'll kill fairfax this year.
tradition.
what does that mean?
based on what?  you never even see him.
this could be it!
um... yeah.  now he's going to need a respirator. do you have one?
car clean? plenty of gas?
this brother from my college.
just...images, really. feelings.
i swear to god. silent bob, am i lying?
couple more seconds!
what?  oh, i don't know.  let me look.
with those big, dark, haunted eyes. as if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
yah, that was different. management was restructurin'--
harriett...
oh, just some friends!
the chief-inspector thought you might need a hand.
he's a freak! that's how they live. we're partners, him and i, business partners. you're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
i came to see you.
i'm not your boy, jake.  i don't like you, and i don't like what you are.  i got no choice but to do business with you.  this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
no advice from the experts, huh?
clem, i'm sorry. i shouldn't have --
that bite healed up quickly. it's been about three weeks?
everyone but me--what do you want now, mary?
|      it's not working. you're not doing it properly.  ni!
what are you talking about? yes we have. and we would have been beautiful about it. we would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the king with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
gold leaf, art nouveau, french, early nineteen hundreds... i could probably fence this for three or four grand.
then you shouldn't have started with a question. because people want to answer questions. you should have started with, "the thing about icebergs is..."
is that right?  think you're gonna make it with her?
who's nina?
it wouldn't be half so much fun for me. toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
hey drop it, okay?
i don't know... surprise me.
tastes good.
of course - of course!  hands in...
i'll just try the first one.
can you play "teddy bears' picnic?"  it used to be her favorite.
ever since i've known you.
the zoo.
yeah.
had it with deals.
no you're not.
well, maybe that's what they teach you in new york university. in real life, it don't work out that way. you wait till you are a mother.
no. it isn't.
oh, the poet? where?
why don't you return this car and borrow mine? have debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
forty-five all total.
i love you.
but deliver us from the evil one.
why did you do that?
this morning.
and i'm the devil! now kindly undo these straps!
mr greenleaf.
well sir... i'm not sure i understand the distinction between 'reflexive' and 'voluntary' nerve impulses.
the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran.
uh-huh. why?
i'll take him.
don't miss your plane.
well, i've brought you here.  what now?
will you lead me to her?
why don't you go on. we'll meet you at the clearance desk in a few minutes.
right. long live... what's your planet?
as long as i get the laugh.
no, i didn't. i didn't kill anyone, sheriff.
relax now, sarah --
and what are they doing now, mac?
no, neo.  that's not true.  it can't be true.
oh, well...
thanks.
what about your grandmother?
sure it's about you.  but it's about society, too.
it's okay, rose. you can go with him.
she got the child labor stuff from me.
the pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
not if you're careful.
yes?
i was just wondering.
i suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
... i will.
who's there?
a few days, ma'am.
nah i think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. i just hope none of us end up dead.
i haven't been a detective for four years.
haldeman too?
oh, this?—i like privacy when i retire. i'm very delicate in that respect. prying eyes annoy me.  behold the walls of jericho![4] maybe not as thick as the ones that joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. you see, i have no trumpet.  now just to show you my heart's in the right place, i'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
i'm proud of you, sam.
does it work?
so do i.
takin' a bath.
forget it.
how do i get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
of course he does. now get the key, get these things off me.  unhook me.
no, no, no. we've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. the security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
oh . . .
not the one thing. i used to think i could at least some way put things right. i don't feel that way no more.
you got me.
yep.
let's see...  next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
i'm sorry... i don't know what to say.
or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
you are an amazing lover.  you should be giving motivational seminars.
i missed all of you.  we're okay, aren't we?
what is it?
for some. live forever, never get old. the ultimate high.
i... um...
yes.
everybody shut up.
if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, i'd arrest you right here.
i've just been so busy, lisa.
bullshit?  i'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
how's that, buddy?
this.
well.  good luck with that --
but ringo starr doesn't look anything like topol.
i'll meet you there.
yes.  tell me.
yes it was.
yeah.  jackie treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat lebowski.
brother malcolm, i want you to meet brother earl. he just joined the nation.
no need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
yes.
well you should have eaten your breakfast.
when?
how can we stops him now?
the point sounds fine.
uh, yeah. does she have big hooters?
karl, what in the world are you doing here?
so that pudding was bought, i bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by healthy choice and american airlines. it's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying healthy choice products. they make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
send the following message...
and if future man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. all right?
i know about esparza.
well, mister hendershot, if i was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if i was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, i guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
no.  i was going to let you do that.
you work for me.  i'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
what are you talking about? this bar is packed with professional people!  everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... luckily, i'm currently off men, so i've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
i took a loan on my car and my computer.
you're a nice man.
no! i can't explain now. oh, look -- the pearls. you wear them now...
shhh!
sins of the flesh?  everybody has those.
i am always on time.
let's get out there. and have them run down every 167 shelby mustang in the area ... find out where they're at.
there's another choice.
me neither. nothing too exciting. so tell me, to what do i owe the honor?
i've heard so much about this club of yours. i had to come and see.
gone out with you. she woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
i'm sorry. . .  i'm. . .
yeah. transmission's shot.
sometimes, yeah. you know, i started to do performances.
you don't call.
their child died, and they got a lawyer.
yeah, yeah. yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. i mean, it's dumb, i know, it's just...
thank god. now listen to me, asshole. i'm giving you a break. but if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in sioux falls maximum security.
congratulations.
that's what i thought he said.
this won't take long.
you said five hundred and fifty!
why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
what happened?
hm.
they're holding position.
we don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  you have <u>my</u> respect. have you discussed the note with dr. hudson?
oh, no!  i run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows i might be capable of doing.
don't tell me your ticket was in it?
in her dreams.
it's alright.  i'm very happy for you.
that young lady's size, right'cher.
oh, pretty good.
good morning.
what... what do you mean?
five thirty.  okay.
i was teamed ten years with the best in the business. cole langley.
what am i supposed to do?
and decent.
ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. i can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  i will not  be known only for my failures.  and you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  you're too smart.  you'e too proud.  dr. malcolm.  please.  this is a chance at redemption.  for both of us. there's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
he's irresponsible.
hey, easy now.
and by sea!
it's very interesting.
florida license plate.
no, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  if he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  i think you'd better get some people out of bed, detective.  in the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
okay.
the boss is watching us...
umm, i don't think that...
not enough.
we'd better see.
april.
yup. sixty years old by our count. but he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: he's barely out of his teens.
did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  and that her mother killed herself in our living room?
uh-huh.
yeah.
marry my child next thursday morn. the gallant, young and noble gentleman, sir paris, at saint peter's church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
my attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for chrissake.
yeah.
yes... i've always wondered what patrick swayze is like in real life.
oh, julie...my poor stu...my poor baby brother...
yes?
you think about your father a lot, don't you?
frank?
no kidding.
yes. sure. what's a steering committee?
it's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into bat shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that bat shan is surrounded.
oh, god, sir, i dinna think so...
alright!  alright... put me down...
you mean -- you and me? i thought you were taking the branch manager from kansas city --
oh fuck, toby's that little china girl.
that is of no interest.
i'm a professional killer.
since when?
dude, your chick's a little high strung.
it was in the 70's, everything was different. i was well known for my parties, rina knew what they were. it was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
i don't mean her --
i'm tired of this.
well, she's a pretty amazing girl. what are women like out here?
now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. it's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. it's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
what?
lover's lane!
if what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? a man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
you've been through it.  that's how you love people.  when it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
no, you can't --
what do you think?
you dump her and i'll give you cash.
great, great, fantastic. fantastic. incredible. incredible, really incredible.
now and then. why, do you?
they're screaming for starbursts.
well ya know, delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. yep, it's like our friend george is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. but don't worry, delmar; he'll be back on top again. i don't think we've heard the last of george nelson.
no one, sir.  it was just me.  i did the proofing so i inserted my article in place of rob crane's.
don't make me tell you, jason.
not much. we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
bingo.
yes, of course...maybe one hour.
'thou sayest it; i am a king.  this is why i was born and why i have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
all i have to do is grab my suitcase, and i'm ready. you're lucky cause i happen to love night drivin'.
seven o'clock?
when they watched at all. do you like movies?
so that was why she tried to run away.
you wait here'n to take us?  like you bus driver to dere?
just how easy is it to build a... device?

babalouey, you were perfect, i could hardly keep from busting up.

your words drove bouchon to --
i'll get him.
i mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  well, guess what?... it isn't.  not for you, not for anybody.
jeremy if you pull that trigger i'm going to leave! i'm going to go to new york.

that tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
you don't know me. you don't know me!  so fuck you. fuck you.
tell him i was looking for him, okay?  i'm dan.
the nazi's killing his kid. he could've jumped the guy. he could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... what would you have done if they were killing your son?
still the man.
how do i know you'll keep your word?
the kiss tickets, you nimrod! they're just fuckin' gone! please tell me you have'm!

that didn't leave much for wallace reid.
hey, believe me -1 know i've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
that silly-ass look on your face.
well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and i guess you have.
look, i really appreciate your help, enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
oh no!  uuh.
sneaking around with your brother?
someone beat you.

go ahead then.
i will protect you.
no, i don't mean you have to. it's just that we may not have enough --
i'll give you half of it.  here's seventy cents. 
honor thy mother and thy father too don't kill, don't steal, it's bad for you
you and mom have a lawyer?

you run the job, but i run the show. you got two weeks to set it up.
lydia is the girl parry likes... and i thought, if i could get them together i...

bullshit.  you probably know the light schedules, too.  listen, i'm in town tonight on a closing.  five stops, one night.  i gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  i got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  why don't you hang with me?
again?  i didn't wanna do it the first time.
but honey, i'll be good. i promise. i love you sweetie. i'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
you're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
if she was dangerous before--
is the marriage off then, miz wharvey?
they do this with impunity!
no.
go for it.
gimme the binoculars.
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. it's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. i was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
i used to helm a school ship.  a long time ago.
maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the getty museum...
we've got the kid!  we've got your kid!!  what the fuck is she thinking?!
we got free tickets.
mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped...

he has come to help mister burns. somehow i feel responsible.
ya looked through it?
no, i don't.
--what?
but you don't agree?

i'm gonna finish packing tonight... i'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
lock the doors and call your husband. get your family as far away from haddonfield as possible.
listen, "princess", you can't order me around.  out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
just now... i went with seymour.
what you been up to?
she didn't seem herself.  for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  one night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  she took some clothes.
where you goin'?
tell me you love me.
tell him that.
no. mother superior told me to come.
she called the consumer...the attorney, i don't know.  the attorney gen...they said we have three days...
a number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the chamber of commerce.
what is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that i could tell. what you make of that?
duets? but can we trust him?
i have a half brother.
that's okay, lar. i gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
what d'you say, willie?  tighten her up?
but i...
and he keeps it in his apartment?
and you were a sympathetic ear.
keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
here i am.
the "skylight?" fool!  it's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
your mother and i do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
what are you talking about?
[cutting in] mackenzie, listen to me. listen. i'm going to die.
i thought you were going to take him that night but...
forget it, venkman.  you had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  now it's my turn, smart-ass.
i was on a roll!  i’m a little overextended now.
you can't just -
i'm sorry i wasn't here for this.
how did you know we were on this island? do others know? will others come?
uh-huh.
listen...
martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
afraid not.  you can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
i'm afraid i'm feeling a little tired, mr. lovett.
i've had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow.
yeah?  well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  but take my advice.  put a little more life into it than you usually do.
you attacked me.
-- plus the forty to mason... how many letters is that?
good. you're discreet. i like that in a partner.
but it's not a year from now, is it?
tony.
look at him.  you think he played it square?  how much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
<u>what</u>? she's <u>blind</u>, bro. you may as well ask one of these beethoven guys on the piano?
the word is no.  i am therefore going anyway.
this is your home. it's not nowhere. and it's not dull.
i don't know if that's such a--
what rielly?
so we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
i... i love everybody, man.  i love my wife.  my kids.  little tyson. my new baby kaydee.  my brother tee pee. i love my friends, my teammates, who am i leaving out?
well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from moscow and return to poland for the winter.
i'm frightened, mitch.
still makin' jokes?
four.
d.o. to number three..come in.
it's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. jesus, i'll-my accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, i'll pay for it.
i'm sorry.
duh hickey.
it's not mine either.
but, he didnít know about you.  in all fairness, ethan, claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. but i was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "thou shall not covet thy neighbourís wife", ethan.  oh, ethan is in love with you, claire, make no mistake about it.  and like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way i do?"
i've got friends.
a think wire---but very, very strong.  let's get out of here.
sorry.  we had another bat sighting.
what happened to him?
i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
i must have fallen asleep. i was asleep when you got home, wasn't i?
harry, what are you doing? she's a foreign exchange student. she doesn't speak the english.  ching chong ching chingy chingy chong chong.
bye. 
i won't forget this.
i'm glad you let me talk to you. you used to not let me talk to you.
only in bad weather.
i wonder if i might look to see if there's an address for family -- i thought i'd like to write to them.
no. he did not.
why?
say we've arrested a good suspect. you walk in and see him. what is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
aubrey run! aubrey stares in horror at maura - just then the knife fades away as maura rolls over, returned to normal -
margo, as you know, i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith. i have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. you were one. jeanne eagels another... paula wessely... hayes - there are others, three or four. eve harrington will be among them...
and you think it's best if i don't come.
a massive cardiac arrest.
perhaps.
no, they won't -- i won't let them.
maybe later.
yes... but... i didn't...
i guess...i don't know...i guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
nowhere?  i'm...here.
bring him up.
you must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
show yourself.  the real you. the secret you.
this committee owes an apology!
they can't do that to me!
it is my oil!  mine and my family’s!
oh?
i really think we should go back...
shall we say dinner on friday. just the two of us?  you can come too if you like, schwartz.
don't go playing policeman.
i shouldn't drink when i'm driving.
what's that?
right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
straightest answer your department's given me all week.
what?
seven o'clock.
i'm sorry.
that was -- oh, shit. what if he's on his way over there?
i don't know.  soon.
i don't know. like i said, she's not my father's case.
i didn't do anything wrong.
go on.
now.... according to the file, krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. but get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in springwood. all teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like krueger's.
i'm fine, thank you.
sir?
guess so.
we were in love... weren't we?
don't tell me boston is different from new york.
why? what difference does it make? you already got his money...
primary arming switch.
you saved the ship.
twelve.
other clinics?  oh sure.  clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
gray. they were a lovely, lovely gray.
he made you give him a blow job.
... perhaps there is a way... i have heard tales of another power.
next time, date only basketball players.
hello.
i'm no good for you katka, besides i won't be able to stay in prague.
if my guests do not like it here, i suggest they accompany you to the nursery where i'm sure you will all feel more at home.
it is customary to make a little speech on the first day. it does no harm and authors like it.
it’s my father’s pin. he wore it everyday of his life.
i love two things. i love you, and i love the opera. if i can have the two things that i love together for one night, i will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
fine. i'll need a $500 retainer. you can mail it.
the water ski show!  we have to get them out!
sector four is secured, we put out the last three german one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc.
we talk different?
that's against the law, isn't it? i can't wear a uniform anymore.
i'm sorry.
i tried.
no, no.
i was wrong.
oh well, duty calls. time to add another chapter to my work of art.
get out of there now!
i think i've heard this speech before.
not my choice of toast, but it's your call. to your triumph over annette.
apology accepted.
in a few minutes....
look, food!
it's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  alright, let's set this spinnin'...

i give a fuck?  i'm done!  i quit! do you fucking hear me!  i'm fucking gone!
they'll be back. he had to go in for a urinalysis.
it ain't. it's part of the lessons of life. i picked me up a pack of vantages before we left the cape?
yes.  it's asta's christmas present.
fucking map quest. <i>never again.</i> <b> ext. downtown garage rooftop -- next </b> ziering and green approach a large tent. the winnebago is parked off to the side. alf is inside... doing something with a welder on the front of the rv.
that's just it huey. the pigs don't know how many panthers there are. both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. we're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
at least i've stayed true to myself. which is more than i can say about some people.
i'm sorry, tron... he's... he didn't make it.
... and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
i know i did.
yes, osgood?
and i'm arranging deportation papers.

i love this guy! 
this really looks like hawaii here.
he has? .. what's he doing here?
i agree.
give me what i want -- and i'll consider it...
it's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  can i help you?
well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
let's let the machine work on him.
i thought it over, and you were right. you wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
genesis?! whatever for?
and what do you want out of this?
so are you.
yeah. i got elbowed right in the eye. and if that wasn't enough, i got hurled the ball when i'm not looking. wam! right in my face.
he filmed his victims.
dwight. dewey was something i got stuck with a long time ago.

laws don't touch men like thaddeus rains. only justice does.
no, we're just...
how did you know?
ruiz isn't here.
what?
for what?
because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
isn't it? isn't it! you know i was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
it’s not me. i swear. it’s her. she’s magic.
i see, a flying carpet, huh? i don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
not usually. mostly trustafarians.
he's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
what do you mean, i handed her? the patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
what are those mirrors for?
what?
once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
nothing...hey michael...you know i was thinking about yesterday.  maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
i used to be so proud of him. my big deal daddy. and now, he's just a crook. worse even. and the weird thing is...
have you seen this?
he loved her.
smythe! give them one drink and throw 'em out!
who are you? doctor adams was supposed to assist me.
well, listen to this. he got mad at me one day. boy, did he get mad at me. he took the light bulb, ya know. i thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. but he ate it. he ate the whole fucking light bulb.  now, tell me! is he crazy? tell me! is he crazy?
you know how when we close up, i close the register, then you lower the shades, then i turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.

awe inspiring.

the sicilians.
i'm getting by.
when do we get to drink it?
how long is the voyage?
i don't want you to do anything. let your conscience tell you what to do.
it needs a more object-oriented language. this doesn't scale, does it?
and we can watch ...
we moved rooms because of him.
like a tea ceremony?
you turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
fuck you.
it looks like ít, but who knows? the opportunity was there. in my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
what are the heads?
take it easy, bongo.  we'll handle mr. valiant our own way... downtown.
uh-huh. do you remember what she said? what did you talk about?
is that why you and your friend split up?  because you wanted to be free?
so do you.  and to think i was worried...

was it funny?
well, i hope you like these! fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. or "nori" if you prefer. i love sushi.
betty sizemore. what do you mean you wrote it?
only thing, what i go after, i want to go after. i don't want it to come after me.

oh, for christ's sake.
<u>i did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. i must be senile. mr. saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
tonight's the night.
that prick tried to get jessica to blow him in the bathroom --

what do you want?
...just kickin' ass and taking names, mr. mannheim.
getchmis...?

munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of british military interests.
i know that this was probably a great white shark.  car-cadon... caradan....
just a guess. she ain't dead though is she?
we don't have any coffee.
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva?
we walk.
you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."

actually i've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
i need ya help again.
who is he?
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there i don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
yes.
the what to what?
yup. the whole rig. i don't care much about the rest, but i surely will miss that bay. least they didn't kill me. that was right considerate, i thought. they were laughing when they left me. thought it was real funny. i walked for a little while but there was no use, so i gave it up. figured it was just bad luck.
he wishes to inform you that vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of kanly -- is still alive. he does not wish to meet or speak with you.
well i'm on my lunch hour. i'll wait.
and tell me that she's happy.
yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
she's dying. but i could still hear her big mouth.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
so have you. so have i. so's everybody got a record. what difference does that make? you can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
silencio! i just drank my weight in sunny d. and i have to go, pronto.
yes, i see that private trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  i also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  fort dix?

okay. then you can be of use.
thanks.  so which one are you? sister bruce?  sister doug?
i love her.
watch the tell-tales chuck.  if we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
i'm not knocking it.  it's a great solution.  not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
the one in your mind. the one that you see on a bright cold morning. the one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
i’ll just full yours up to the top.  happy anniversary, sweetheart.
have a good trip.
you guess he's your boyfriend? or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
suit yourself.
i'll find it.
not counting this week.  you secured employment last june as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
no way to start a partnership.
you're not scared, are you?
i'll bet.
yes.
oh, yeah! you and what army?
you don't have a room?  paolo?  what did i just hear?  i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
nothing lasts.
tryin' to get a buzz on. but i'm too buff. too much muscle mass.
it's too late for me. and besides... who'd look after her? she'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. when you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. oh, i don't hate her.  i hate... what she's become. i hate... the illness.
upper management thinks you're dull.
skeleton key. this opens the gates of babylon.
alright. good luck, yourself.
y'know what?
--fuck your bullshit pieties! you were the next to die, asshole!
what's old got to do with it?
how come you never got married again?
i'm not going out anymore. i'm not getting hurt again. this was the last time. i told you.
prepare to receive the act of penance. how many sins have you committed since your last confession?
but, bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. that brings you good luck for ten years.
and you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
roy! what are you doing here?
well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
'bye.
is he on the level of assistant to the president or not?
if you'd apologize i think dennis would take you back.
max, i've got a hit series.
you say that just to flatter me.
well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
oh, i'll just mosey around here and there.
technothugs.
yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
mainly.  and also that i'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
don't say "okay," diz. say you think it's beautiful.
take some allergy medicine.
backdraft.
wiping cut the human race!  that's a great idea!  but it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  i didn't say a word about "you know what".
but it hasn't been forever. 
we spent a lot of time in nicaragua... places like that.  for a while she was with this crazy ex-green beret guy, running guns.  then there were some other guys.  she'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  didn't you know?  it's like... everything i'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? i hated her for that.  but everything she said was true.  we gotta get her out of there.
listen. you have to -- finish me off. you don't want me coming back.
i don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
shut up.
are you a rotten liar.
it's not that easy.  worked construction every summer to get through school.  three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  finish school first, sean.  then make up your mind.  if you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
why do you think i ask?
my god!  wha-what is this?  the gestapo?  no.
can you watch gideon for a while? one of the girls is going into labor. junior is going to drive me over.
i don't know anything.
not now, elaine!
it's perfect.
president.
i don't want you to think that i'm a drinker. i can stop any time i want to - only i don't want to.  especially when i'm blue.
no.
man?
gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
like what?
champion's going to bounce back, and i want to be here when it does.
razinin.
you did what?
cameron -- do you like the girl?
th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
one, two...  three, four...  five...  why you, dirty, stinking...
letting him use your toilet? no store does that.
it just slipped your mind.
no water.
have you succeeded in your task?
i might still get there first. the lights are with me.  how would i identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
but i love you. i'll love you forever.
bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
i've met someone else.
in time for what?
don't you remember what they called you?
yes.
you think lorenson kills you?
yeah...
yah.
wrong! i was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to california... there's a big difference.
what do you mean?
this is doyle, jeff.
what does clifford say?
i -- i -- i...
fuck you, you fat fuck.
yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
i've been tempted.  but i think it's important to retain objectivity.  i wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
good.  how long will it take?
our band "mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. jam's mom said something about sending him to st. bernard's, right? we gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
i need it.
yeah, sure, karen.  you bring in chirino, you can be on the task force.
you wanna know why?  'cause that mother fucker kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents 'til kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause kennedy promised 'em too damned much. revolution comin'.  fascism's coming back.  i tell ya this - the day that communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  i jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  people should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'cause he was a communist.  put me on the stand, go ahead, i'll tell the same goddamn story, i'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
father, i have betrayed my family. i betrayed my men.  and i betrayed you.
so you're chicken?
spear.
not the point.
er, fertilizer.
we practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
why wouldn't i?
do you wanna head back and call it in?
where do i sign, mr. thatcher?
can i help you?
i don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  something under the floors, not on the plans. i don't know!
well, i just don't know how to thank you, mr. barnes --
me too, doc. and i can't tell you what that package meant to me --
my adoptive grandfather. who knows what my biological grandfather did.
stop!
doctors and nurses can only do so much, alma.  they can't cure everything.
do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
go for it, man.
when it's not yours. my mom was going through her harlequin romance phase.
it did, pop.  it did.
it's simpler than that, brad.  a society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
we're going to think about it, cole. among ourselves.  we'll get back to you.
i stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, mom.  get out of my room.
it's me, honey. it's mom.
bye, barry.
sattler.
half past eleven.
i don't think you're a bum.
if they were having an affair how come that cotton couldn't prove it in court?

tomorrow?
what do you think you're doing? go on, get out of here.
okay, that's your opinion.  i don't agree.
no, i'm not.  i don't know why i said that. i've been in a very... strange mood all day. i've never done anything like that before. it's... i'm just...  well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
i can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  i can give her the brush ...
yeah, i've always been able to make my way in the world.  i don't like having to rely on other people.
seems like i hear everything that goes on in this dump. pipes or somethin'. i'm just glad i don't have to ply my trade in the wee-wee hours.
this, this is life indeed!  life worth preserving, such life as juba never felt till now.
six rounds. 357.
mr. scott -- how soon?
what is the northcountry development association?
stick around and find out.
y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
that's nice.
carl said he didn't like kabuo much anymore.
all right --
sure.  i loved it.
i don't believe you, margaret. frank wasn't like that.  i'm the villain in the family, remember?
terrific.
i varn you. if you don't lie on the floor, i vill have to stun you.
five.
adios, bridge!
my life is a living hell.
our other dinner guest.
if i never eat at another waffle house again, i can die a happy girl.
not very well. we met shortly after the enterprise-e was commissioned. i found her to be a most... promising officer.
look, look at that guy.
correct.  now secure a sinex drop reading.
choices?
jesus.  two in one night?
what about julia?
it is his new partner that i'm worried about.
transmit a wide band co-variant signal. that'll get his attention.
we, we...no...we just had a small reversal in the case... i have some, uh...i have some work to do...
i do okay.
shush.  of course you can.
yeah, i broke my fall.
mr. treves, tell me... tell me truly. is it alright, did i make any mistakes that you can see?
you can't quit, scully.
look fella...this is private...
we should just do it.
we already did.
how could we prove...  well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
they would?
no you don't!  no... lydia... why?
i imagine that'd be rather difficult.
no.
he's dead.
she came to talk to me...
what'd the devil give you for your soul, tommy?
no, i'm sure we'll be fine.
she's out with a friend.
yeah, cool.
well, that does sound very odd.
now, please, swana.
i'm not going back in there. i told ya this was a one way trip. now stand aside.
anti-semite!
yeah.  that's it.
mmm.  look closer.
right.
what did you expect?
no -- you musn't. he thinks i've bewitched you. he won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! my only chance is to stay away from him.
why would he be frightened?
good, it was all right.
look... you... take her and get the hell out of here. i'll keep 'em busy.
date of birth, november the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
i'm sorry. i was in jail once.  i accidentally burned down this house. it was abandoned. i got held back in school again. can't drive until i'm eighteen.  i think when i grow up i want to be a painter. or maybe a writer or maybe both. then i'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. you know, change things.
yoo hoo, bomb...
i blame myself.
like you, i'm good at it.  but at this exact moment in time...like i gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
how are we going to cope?
look, i didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, i just thought you'd call when you came back. you didn't and...  don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
... no, no, no...
all i'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  i've heard stuff.
let's have lunch!
curing countless diseases, not just ours.
yeah.
well - it's cold, margie.
the weather.  i see.  keep me posted.  i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
i know who he is...
but how long?
are--are you crying, penelope?
in other words, par for the course.  how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
neurologist? why? what's wrong?
a bit sadistic, don't you think, captain...?
ah no.
good.  that's it...see you.
i was on call. 
no!
you're not a man because of a job, duff.
this would be it?
thank you, bob. the electricity is everywhere tonight. rocky balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier.' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... his record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
no... don't hit me please...
is she as pretty as you?
no... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
but where do the rats come in?
soon, bela... soon.
in time she'll be what you are.
sounds familiar.
i'm sorry about the misunderstanding, hal.
tragedy?
you cheap honky sonofabitch...
who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
yes.
did you?
what about her teeth? what about her fangs?
<u>hello</u>.  what?
the wandering sportswriter.
you know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. you can buy child whores, slaves. you can have people raped, killed...  one of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named ratan. he usually isn't in this country.  how'd you hear about him?
yeah... yeah... i guess so... that kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
the republican party was never home to extremists.  you should know better. this guy's as stupid as mccarthy, and mccarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
i'm a fraud! but it's not like normal people can have this ass! if my fans knew, i'd lose everything. i've already lost my husband. i rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
don't give me that! she liked you, man.
let me think.
mcgill. no, the marriage'll take place as planned.
sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? bull shit. but one of our kind? not a whisper.
i always thought you'd follow me up.
faulty wiring.
too late for what, dear child?
he takes good care of that.
so isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
it's awful soon after ben's passing.
aren't you off-duty?
well, look at it this way, i mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
that's awful generous of you. i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
keep it.
you asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
i was seeing aaron and there were some ... complications.
but no one actually saw him die.
"it looked extremely rocky for the boston nine that day."
hmm...
how'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  right now.  i can do it if i get out.
we can't... stay here.  that traitor d'artagnan... knows about this place.
something's haywire,
look. when you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  when you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. when you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. when you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  not very sure. you have one chance out of five to miss.  a contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  you can't miss a client. never... if the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. that is, you insure yourself by another means.
i told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked asap.
right, if this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure i have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a toyota the last time i did one of these
cut the power!
which question is that?
i don't shed tears over the past, monsieur delbenè; i look to the future.
yes.
can i see him?
you can't say *that* to--
merci!
why thank you sir.
beautiful but dangerous.  once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  it's 400 years old.
yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
why?
"the wrong hands"? we're not talking about military secrets, john. they're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
didn't even have to ask.
your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. did you know that?
it's miss america, n'you're bert parks. 
i'm afraid you've got to.
maybe the demons are real.
the kuala lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. captain blamed the auto-pilot; i suspected he was drunk - until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
well this is... i mean, this is the weirdest --
i'm sorry i couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
billings, if hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... concentration camps all over europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... he's a putz.
yes, jacqueline. you were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
i stood alone on the green, searching for something, and i started to walk to the church. but then the darkness closed in, i was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and i fought to wake up...
i generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
from what?
denying?
how does it matter who's sister? the main thing, they're through and -
she won't tell me everything. it's a bank job, that's all i know.
i shall remember to pay it... to myself.
oh.  that's nice.
well, i, you know, i took her to the van, you know. it was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? and she started crying, "tim, tim, what's the matter? i love you. don't go!" and i was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and i was filled with disgust, man. and i fuckin'... oh, man, i really...
i don't know where she is!
i know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
agnes, who did this to you?
d.a.m.o.u.r.  d'amour.  harry d'amour.
my power cells continually re- charge themselves.
you're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but i think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
a good deal, like this with us, for burnett will be good only temporarily.  he'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  life is dust, make it while you can.  he's ambitious.
you ought to stay over. you always wrote a good hanging story, hildy.
why would you want me to kill you?
what do you want to change about this moment?
what are you doing here?
what's this?
you like her.
no.
it's not something he wants to publicize, ma'am.  it's just something he does.
the vietnamese think it's theirs -- i guess the americans do, too.
homicide.
where did you hear that, one of those american talk shows?  check, please.
good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  maybe they never would have found you.  day like today you'd be dead for sure.
you didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a bible study class.
then, you kiss his ass.
if that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
this is not cool.
then why are you smiling?
how can you be sure?
i hope so, sir.
he's hallucinating badly.
i'm not up for running into anybody. let's just kick it here, alright?
stop...
kampai.
with love's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls; for stony limits cannot hold love out, and what love can do that dares love attempt; therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
set to the poem of yetveshenko!
yes.  i wrote it.
she'll be away on friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the grants in glasalt.  if she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  she'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
yeah, well --
that is both impudent and untrue... tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our billy's latest effort?  or should i say, his "next-to-latest"?
certainly a new experience for me.
i'm sure he could give you some courage.
no.  i'm saying they were always fake.  the saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
you've come to lecture me?
you want me to tell you it's your fault? it probably is. what are you going to do about it?  i thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
the kid's got talent. you've never seen malkovich like this. schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. impressions.
-- planet. i mean, you were there. do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, wally.
well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
forcefields, full remaining strength...! total reserve!
uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
oh, please.
thank you.
well, there's a problem.
well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
"you're gonna die tonight, faggot". clear as day.
shucks.  guess not.
you don't have to tell them anything. we're getting you a lawyer.
having a gun pointed at you for one. it's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. three on a match, black cats... believe it. believe it all.
hey - i'm getting married in the morning - i already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, doctor.
perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

i been mindin' pearl.
what?
you're too small to be bogart.
agnes?  who?  mother superior?
this time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. why don't you dump the mother, henry? he creates more work than he gets done.
let's do the small talk in the car. load up.
forty-two-hundred, i figure.
yeah... mmmm...
what are you doing in my closet?
jack oberfeld in person.  did you kill him?
the helicopter never arrived at nellis and there's been no radio contact.
i guess.
spies from quebec confirm that the british are sending an entire fleet down lake champlain...
ok.  he asks about you all the time. it's been weeks since you've seen him.
if that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. you, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
i meant later... when you two took naps.
you're always so worried about your reputation.  we don't need the university. einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'they can't stop progress.
not with what they pay me...
how is my dear friend benjamin feeling?
oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... i'm on my way. is there anything more you've thought of-?
drop that attitude.  here's some- thing really worth while.

rocco!
it just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  if you think i am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, kenny.

yeah, morgan. it's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
you love allison, don't you?
you're a swine. so hurry up ... we're travelling!

we have to do something. what can we do to help, selina?
here, you gotta delivery.
hell, yeah. to her dumb country ass, compton is hollywood. close as she's ever been, anyway.
yes.
now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
once i wanted five grand --  cash -
once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.

i think not.  there'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  you'll get a charge out of this.
what now?
splendid!
one of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "you think life's beautiful, don't you, jessica?  you think you're beautiful, don't you, jessica?"  what he could do to that word "beautiful." that's paul's great weapon -- words.  he uses them the way other men use their fists.
daddy?
i don't know.
a bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, jimmy?
my coordination. reaction time. if top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
fire?  what are you talking about?  he had cancer, john.
oh my g-d, how embarrassing were they? i wanted to shoot myself.
how could i go away? i'm in debt up to my...  if she did steal that money...  it's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
a smaller bowl of flowers.
so you ain't with the state no more?
yeah.
<i>de nada</i>. now, come here...bend over...before i change my mind.
i aspire to be more than i am.
oh, god!
i wouldn't actually call it a party. it's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  the guest list is quite restricted. so far, there's mr. benjamin and myself. if you accept, that would make three of us.
i'm saying if he knows i'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  he's had enough!  he no longer digs her!  it's all a show! but then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  i mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
and i know what i'm talking about.
and give a deposition to the judge.
mccool's that same rank.  we're both j.g.'s.
i'll go to the hospital.
oh.  well, i have got to get to the dentist be-...
let's review these notes for your testimony. we have a big day on monday.
the whole fuckin' thing...the pressure's just too great.  you're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  all of them.  you go in the door.  i..."i got to close this fucker, or i don't eat lunch," "or i don't win the cadillac..." we fuckin' work too hard.  you work too hard.  we all, i remember when we were at platt...huh?  glen ross farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
will that do?  no?
nothing at all?
i gotta admit, you're one of them. just wish i knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, i want to talk about you...
bad bulb or no power. it's getting a little gloomy in here.
who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? c'mon --
well...
i'm just thinking i'm glad i broke up with everyone i ever went out with.  the swelling is gonna go down, right?
yeah joe why there's a little man in my head?
but you can't think through this one.  you have to feel it.
who is this paxcow? is he like the boogeyman?
something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
married.
that's all i want to know.  lets get out of here before i get the epizootics myself. thank you, doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
typical psych major. a complete wise ass. and how's your project coming? still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
wait!  there's a nice little one over there!
oh, please. come on, john. you're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. you're a liar. but at least i know you're a liar. it's the people that don't know, like ann, that have to watch out.
three's a crowd. yes, i'm aware of that. but i have to keep an eye on mr. benjamin wherever he goes. to make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
why, yes, of course ... but for the moment, let's be satisfied with algiers! in the mountains our work is always easier.
uh, can i have the other one. the one below this one. they show more in that one.
you're walking to california?
put it out, man!
it's the best, nuke...the absolute fucking best.
nothing that concerns you spacemen. just us toys.
whatever you need, i'll be there.
no.
beats forty hours on a plane.
it <u>is</u> beautiful. but i got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so i gave it to my secretary.
tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
we understood there were four people living here. not always, of course, but now, four.
are you sure?
god, i'm so sure. don't blame me, blame heather. she told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. back me up, heather.
she won't?  why not?
jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up. i'm a little concerned.
well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, i thought, if you were willing we might move you to grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. see we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
i don't want to leave her. dick... the, the... and father laughlin, he said that it was god's will...
you're saying you willed these events to happen?
yes, even i had a mother. she was part austrian, but she was still my mother. my childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
oh mom...
you'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  that's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
i don't know.
because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, mr. carter. it's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the united states alone. the five continents of the world...
i'll bargain with you. how many of you are on the island?
i look forward to the sport.  take him.
what happened, ted? what went wrong?
formaldehyde.
yeah, but are you crazy enough?
once or twice.
whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  john used it as packing material.
just stay calm, use your head. it'll be all right.  just the same, though...  guess you better swear me in.
you're taking this too far, drew.
whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? inside your head. you never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
i'm sure you have.
did he ever marry the girl? did he ever go exploring?
what about him? yes.
suit up.
guess you can tell from my reaction, i'm not all that used to visitors out here. what can i do for you?
no, it's not don.
that isn't true...!
jack kerouback, herman melville, henry miller and hunter s. thompson. i dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. so from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
vada i wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
now is the time to secure your epitaph. the benevolent marquise, charenton's most revered philanthropist... or satan's bride.
baack!
let's hit it.
not even for emergencies?
who needs gus?
i'm stuck...
i read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
yes, but looks are deceiving...  not in this case, however.
that was a mistake.  the white house was full of kennedy people then.  it still is.
i'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
that's none of your fucking business.
it's nothing. he's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
you figured that out, huh?
where is she? where is the girl?
i don't think so.
don't feel that way, honey.
because i told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
mrs. christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  i want you to listen carefully. what you're talking about is a "snuff film."  but, from what i know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  like, red light district folklore.  there's no such thing, i can assure you.
a carousel - - and a seesaw.  they all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "i see the fleas, mummy!  can't you see the fleas?" clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
everyone out of the rigging now!
everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. annie.
the bank. all right. do anything you want with it.
i don't know.  we may never know, but i'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the karpoli family.
you know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
you’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. it’s a whole world, sid. you’re really popular amongst the demented.
profitable.
i think he's fine - i don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - i don't think he would hurt a fly.
all right, all right. here, give daddy the flower. i'll give it a drink.
'cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
stop it!
ask, you're the girl reporter.
i find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
i like it here...
think hard -- it'll come to you...
what?
...i believe mr. sandefur perjured himself because i watched those testimonies very carefully.
it's him.
then don't sweat it, george, you know why?
fuck you!  do you hear me, john!? fuck you!  john . . . john!?
yeah. maybe.
look.  i'm warning you.
but this was the same guy who conducted for adolf on his birthday.
yeah, exactly.  those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
tell me about it, please!
yeah, he told me.
waiting for andy.
some contest board...
how many did he give you?
no, no, that's too far. try a more gentle stroke. it's all in the stroke. go ahead, now, honey - stroke. as the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
gee, honey-bunch, i'm sorry -- i'm going to have to disappoint you.
what happened to me?
shhh!  ...but how can there be a question?... are you my lawyer or theirs?... all right, i'll let you know!
why don't you just take me back without it?
what did they say about granada before today?
well why don't you clean up this dump!
yes, there is. an infallible way! they won!
how did you know -- ?
aaahhnnnahnnnn.
is she here tonight?
i'm a revolutionary.
it is, y'know.
i'll do my best.
no. do that and i guarantee you'll scare him off. i don't want him running away.
yeah, bill, listen, i'll explain to you later. just - you - you got a gun at home? yeah. bring it over here right away.
meet you in the lobby. okay?
well, i don't know what you gonna do about it, because i don't hear no riot an' i don't see no riot, an' what's more i don't believe they *is* no riot.  look for yourself.
i'm not good company. i should be alone.
what kind?
you're drunk --
who said that?
you mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
we always planned to use it. we got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
they look stupid.
half what you owed me. i am still due for one gentleman of verona.
what's it to you?
mercy... is to die quickly. perhaps even live in the tower. in time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
the names i've been called. but never svengali.  good luck.
i don't know.
what did you say?
you wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
what happened in those three minutes...?
uh-huh.  what's going on?
but if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
i do find myself physically attracted to you, mr. taransky.
that'snotmy name...find lily, gimmme that, give it --
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  you just have your hundred grand ready.  for that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
because i can be! the same fucking cheek, goddamnit! why are you pulling my dick? do you think, do you really think, if betty finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? no way! uh-uh!
that's fine, but i don't want you to talk to miller alone.
not here! she's not well, either. she went to the spa.
yeah.  thanks man.
my roommate's very social -- somebody from justice was over and...i always hear things before they happen.  hey, and from now on, so do you.
it's one idea...
if i could trouble the baron to come and see this beautiful room. i have ordered champagne. perhaps the baroness could join us.
you want the job or not?
she still work there?
yes, please.
john, please--
up there... i... eh... can't explain...  but that's the only place you could be from.
well, i thought it was safe--
you want three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at usc.
what!  just a flesh wound. 
hello, tracy.
lighten up...
a bad mother. by any standards. i've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. i know just how bad i was.
then i will respectfully take leave of her.
a word of advice: sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
don't brag now,  jonathan.
you mean teach you how to play. can't. going fly fishing in canada, big client...
he was just acting very strange.  he thinks somebody's after him, chase. it's scary, it scared me.  he was acting like...
i have more men.
...just be smart about it.
why you don't feel love?  not allowed?  dead inside, maybe?  you make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  in-vulnerabo?  bullshit!
"yes, jordan -- i'll wait for you no matter how long."
what's that?
the red sox were my world. i surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
maybe it is.  i wouldn't know.
hm?
<combined miniature deterrent forces>.
you have no idea what's happened to me.
it's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know i'm down to three hours a week now.
i've got him.  the guy in the turban.
that's what i was gonna ask you.
no.  truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
so you do have an agreement with the united states government, mr. jung, correct?
useless distractions.
i've seen a lot of rings.
the girls threw them at me in the locker room.
no. tell me. what's so fucking horrible about this gig? you've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on maxie's list, and here we are.
and to don quixote!
this is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
no, i'll settle for half that in cash.
the one who came with your letter?
what do you mean "what am i afraid of?"
talk to me about what?
hey, man, congratulations!
you ask him if you like, but i would leave him to it if i was you.
please don't shout.
i don't know.  <u>jane, jane, up here</u>!
and that was 28 days ago today.
it's hospital policy...
my jury's still out on that,
yes.
no. she's in fine shape. nothing to worry about. but she doesn't know. you understand that. she doesn't know what she did.
i think it went on rather too long.
i will treasure this.
pardon me?
that's true. but i also owe you something, and i'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  what is it? family problems? money problems?
this is his assertion.
fuck that!  you bastards will jump me!
no, sir, those are... redbirds.
again
how about that talent?  this is like falling into a tub of butter.
oh god, bruce. you're still jealous.
not quite.
thank you, sir!
i'll spot you five points.
maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
dudley's guys.
one day you will.
speaking.
everything... i don't have children.
wow.
joel, we're fucking gonna talk about it!
what's the matter?  the fight gone out of you?  i'm just gonna smash a headlight. maybe two.
my god.  my dress.  we have to find it. and burn it.  and shut the door.
you're full of tricks, aren't you?
makes you cry
good evening. i'd like a single for tonight.
god damnit, electra.  this is not a game.  this is business.
yes, even in berlin. if you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
what?
yes.
whereas you are.
uh-uh.
right. what about condoms?
drown all those rascals...
you wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
not at all, governor.  very striking.
i never seen a man shot before. not even in the service. must be something.
damn, you're beautiful.
cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  the museum is in debt.  contributions and public funding have dried up.  admissions no longer cover overhead.  the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit.  cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  if the superstition exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
i don't know.  it just went dead.
at least he wasn't thirty-six.
that's not the point!  they need me!
if you did it wrong, it would be painful. you'd choke to death.
no!
open the door.  please.
not if they all die at once.
what are you doing here?
sir?
tom? only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to sally an' say you was...
no. it's never going to stop, period. it won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. it's finished. i'm finished.
only in times of extreme stress.
forget it, denham ... for godssake
i know why you broke up with me in college.  and not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what i did was, too.  so if you forgive me, i'll forgive you.
aaron, will you tell me?
pop leibel owns the argosy book shop. what do you want to know?
who knows? guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
it's very late.
no. no, i'm all right.  oh, god, what have i done? i have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  i must be crazy, a child like you. oh, god, oh, lord. this is awful, this is terrible, i gotta get outta here!
so who's gonna pay for it?
what's that?
indeed it is. during the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. as it were.
i'm in california most of the time. traveling a lot on business. that's about it, really.
well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
they did when they were in the carolina league.
you promise?
a soul's search: finding your true character and calling? is this yours?
they never wrote you nothing?
the flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
i didn't kill anyone, bernard, there was no one to kill!
i have other means of sustenance.
from your mouth ta god's ear.
i wish i could say the same for myself. i was up thinking about you all night.
hey, where did you come from?
oh, yes, i remember -- and i should have slapped mrs. teasdale's face when she told it to me... i'm going right out and find trentino.  you go right out and get yourself an army.
i couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
you don't use shit?
she's obviously that. jesus! which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
colon cancer.
this way!  come on!
nothing matters.
good.
yes.  please come in.
once upon a time i was a hell of an engineer.  please, sit, doctor.  i have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  did you know this was once yeltsin's flying dascha?  that dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  at least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
but attractive--
an hour, two at most.
ah there's our snookums now.
you're in oklahoma?!
that you are under no obligation to me?
you suddenly having trouble getting dates?
i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
what else do you like?
private eye?
hello, mr. demille.
norma, grow up.  you're a woman of fifty.  there's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
go on, willie.
you really will?
people who know say the girl's got talent. you must judge for yourself. if you think she stinks, say so.
yeah, but it's all about simon now... you helped with the dog... and now there are other things. i'm just as concerned as you are about simon.
yeah...?
a lot of people think you're a snitch.  it's dangerous ...
would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you?
you want to be a good detective?
you were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
how would you like to join the denominators? the math team could really use a new brain. we lost our best logarithm guy last year.
oh. that’d be rhian, a welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. she got wise and dumped him months ago...
oh man! hey, you still going out with her?
i was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
i'm here.
but she's moving away from the door.  who was sitting at this table?
how about hand-to-hand combat?
you left something out.
of course not.  that would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
tonight?
sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
i didn't want to wake you.
no.  thank you.  it's really beautiful.
i don't see the humor in this. go to your room immediately. you're grounded.
i'm sorry, i can't help it.  it's too funny.
i don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
what do you think?  maybe i could reach the ledge without falling. no, forget it.
pat, i'm not kidding. i really think it's the greatest --
the pilgrim who used penicillin to kill godzilla.
you're absolutely right, i wouldn't give her another thought.
no, no, its alright. i talked to my ex, he'll keep denny over christmas and i'll get him this summer.  goddam it, skipper... i haven't seen him in two months.
i'm just wondering --
abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
railroad burned him out too. you couldn't have stopped him.
then relax.  it's a federal bank. guaranteed by the government.  and senor noriega has very lenient banking principles.  no questions.  no problems. all the pesados keep their money here. even el padrino.  what do you worry? everyone knows we are with escobar.  who is going to fuck with us?
i don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. i don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. personally, i hate offices -- i'd much rather be in the movies.
you mean like you loved mom?
you understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, captain.
the inspection will continue once we're underway, doctor.
our last game is this saturday.
could you?
i don't know.
yes - the worm!
what are you going to do?  charge me with smoking?
poor harry.  always desperate for attention.  what about the bunny?
you devil, it's mace, huh?  what've you got here, a billy?  use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
no ...  have <u>you</u> ever been in vienna?
i'm sorry. i shouldn't have asked you.
passionate! he's a pervert. he should have to register when he moves.
hi jamie.
you didn't hire me.  she did. if she wants me off the job, i want to hear it from her.
quit fucking around.  get in.
he doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
look, she wasn't a relative, okay? i don't know who she is.
let me have that one. where's the nearest hardware store?
is he an enemy?
i am.  really.  it was awesome.
i couldn't. i didn't want you to worry. i thought held sort himself out. i hardly see him. he comes and goes. he's in trouble, isn't he?
damn it!  how long to fix?
we're heading back to cape kenneth.
your client is guilty. don't dick around with me.
you're in the records room.
rayisha.
i guess not.
roof? jesus, skinny, i done practically every damn thing myself. roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
listen...
thank you.
i was hoping we could talk.
terry, no, no... .
good.  they're all heatseekers!  all of them, everybody. you keep one superstar and they'll all follow. there's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, jerry maguire, was you.
can you say anything but "cool"?
morning. any calls?
yes.
it's the receptionist at one of the places i service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today i come in and she's all "i saw you on tv the other night... you were so great ... " next thing i know we're ...
just stay back.
i can't talk about it. the work i was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. i don't know... it could have been beneficial.  mostly, i got paid a lot. i took the money. my wife was happy. my kids had good medical. good schools. got a great house.  i mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
this is true love. you think this happens every day?
you need money?  is that the...
they went that way.
in a way, yes.
sure.  that's why his meatballs are made out of marinated chuck wagon.
abrams...
yes i did.    lose ends are messy.
i don't know...  this thing has got my goat. i've got to find out.
dr. crowe.
you can always come see it in london.
what happened?
keep moving!
we'll have to take it easy then. i don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
you said, first, he was lying.  how do you know that, doctor?
you're a beast!
don't look directly at him.
god bless.
never mind. sorry, that was stupid. i'm embarrassed. good night, joel.
well, it's billy.
i am only his humble servant, but the maharajah usually listens to my advice.
next time we'll bring more blankets.
sure, harry.  i'm on it.
'take me'...?  where?
the torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
jesus, jack. jesus. and you walked all the way back from solvang?
you're in quite a mood today.
howard is a beautiful person.
sure, i understand.  look, i don't want to take up any more of your time.  you get back, and i'll wait here for a bus.
how did you come to that conclusion?
how is she?
i got dibs on his hat!
it bit me!
i miss ray...i tried to call him.
i wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
a man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
i know.
like hell they can't.  they can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
good.
what's this all about?
my father used to have a saying, jud-- "god sees the truth, but waits."
she don't say she is, but i figure she is -
i'd better call sylvie -- she must be frantic.
you must be jonah.
almost.
you want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
green?  not owen green. owen green embezzled money from your grandfather
shit, i guess i missed work.
we can stick to the plan. if we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
there's no such thing as tough, creasy. just trained and untrained.
sleep tight, sweetie.
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust?
what are you going to do?
probably am.  forget i brought it up.
i lost my wallet.
no, no -- just a moment, please.
i'll check it.
i don't know-like two-thirty, three.
more than likely.
yeah.  no, not really.
i don't give a fuck! i didn't tell you to do it!  you can't just do unauthorized work.
you want to go back in?
i could tell you were sad.  i just wanted to see if you were all right.
in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers.
when my name makes them cry in their sleep. when i've brought them to ashes.
i just want to listen.
why should i trust you?
going back to la. maybe i can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the swedish bikini team. no more navy blue suits. no more panty- hose. no more trying to be something i'm not.
what?!?
don't get me wrong, betty. i'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
would you care to explain what you're talking about?
send a unit.
that's your answer to everything, dude.  and let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
all stop, sir.
hey, how ya doin'?
i think so...
take them.
then don't drift down further.
i'm not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident. the only important thing is that he's dead.
baby, we're money.
we all got plans.  i planned on seeing all my life.  i know you didn't plan on straying into town.
ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
don't sweat it. now i got an l.a. gun story. you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home. he had an uzi. mike half-smiles.
if you knew, why didn't you say anything?
why goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
that's right.  and i'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
er ... alright. for christ's sake don't lose it. here, you'd better sign for it.
just... just wanted to say hello...
when you wanted to run away, i called your dad.
i don't care.
we got a call earlier on three negro youths.  firing shotguns in griffith park from a late-model purple mercury coupe.
what if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
hey, big fucking deal.  broke a bad streak...
yes, major.  this looks like it's going to be it.
why should everyone dance the same way?  it's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
victoria? she's okay.
i didn't run into you and i bet they're not your sunday clothes. you've probably got a lot of clothes.
okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, martin?
i'll tell you what .... you tell me what and i'll do it for. i'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
i'll lick the stamps.
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
what did you forget?
what can i tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
i'm much obliged, mr. president, for your concern about me.  however, i happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the united states, and i say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the united states goes into the hands of -
alan was not...unbalanced when i married him.  and he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! hunsecker  i'm not fighting with you, puss...
but... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  i used it.  to <u>bargain</u>.  for her <u>sympathy</u>...  i <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
it's not that easy.
you sure? i know my father would hate to be tied down. he wouldn't even go to the dentist.
so... pretend it's not a game.
do you know how much i missed you?
i'm...what?  sorry?
not going to pole vault anywhere. that's for sure.
thanks, wick.
thought he was doing aa.
roger de bris is the worst director that ever lived.
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
i get it!
you know that can't happen.
you're goddamned right, i give the order.  vote!  jesus christ!  listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes, is that clear?
you're straddling the state line. you're in two places at once.
...since i used to take you to the proms?
don't try to run, maggot. chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
which show was that?
he wouldn't move.
there are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
very romantic setting.
i don't know. you tell me.
you could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's easter sunday hats.
ask him.
what if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
a lot?
i don't know why joe, we've known each other how long...
go the fuck away, rosie.
what?  come on.  she's got a good thing with victor --
i dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
you still don't believe me, do you?
you  make me nervous.  anyway if i can pick your brain --
do you pray?
in fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
if it's not asking too much --  for our information just for illustration  tell us how you intend to run the nation.
-- what you don't understand --
a girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  what's new and hot in gotham city?
that's what he keeps telling me.
you ain't woofin' i did.  stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
qualen, go fuck yourself.  the game's over--you lost.
whatever. i mean, the guy's dead anyway.
is that what a good doctor would do?  how old are you, please?
young blood
well?
the past, the future, whatever this object holds.
i know you think i'm lying to you, but i'm not. every word i told you is the god's honest truth.
i didn't say that.  you did.
i do, i do...
let me take that.
i know, but i'm not seeing it. it's there, frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. you're lazy --
nobody.
what'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
looking for the fossils.  why should we wait until we're in london?  this girl was probably twelve years old.
okay. we can stop that.
just a moment. i don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
the smartest thing i ever did was to make that trip.
all directions are the same here.
no, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. go in and tell my lady i am gone, having displeased my father to father lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
all i need--
ca-na-da...
don't you dare talk back to me!  it's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  but you deliberately deceived me!  who put this in your head? how did you expect to get away with it? answer me!
i know the feel of the world.  i know how this wood will sound when i knock.  i know how this glass will feel when i pick it up.  certainties. you think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. i can remember so much.  i know the feel of the world,  and i know her.
everybody shut up! let the man speak.
i had lunch with karen not three hours ago. as always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about lloyd beating at your door the other night?
that's no business... that's a social injustice.
alright?
i don't.  but the language he's speaking is universal.
if your husband was killed it was.  this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
well, therapy. and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back. i was living in a fairy tale.
i'm glad, john. goodnight.
then i wasn't beautiful.
fuck you.
i had immense plans.
it means a lot.
yeah, i'd say that's it.
i, uh... well, you're not from new york, right?
you're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  and, the only reason i'm here right now is because i wanted to be.
dark and large.  with vines -- no, not vines.  not alive.
nine.
this is not a place you wanna go.
shut up.
why don't we try the giga-meter?
yes, i am programmed to answer any question.
oh, no, no. we don't use money in heaven.
when it falls off the table and turns turtle--cute?
been there, done that, got the t-shirt.
you shouldn't have shown the film to frank.
from the store.
so...wanta make love?
it's called the flame alphabet. it's supposed to be the word of god written in fire.
she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
i couldn't wait two weeks! she's gettin' married tomorra!
do what?
oh, i don't know. it was an accident.
... but he's...?
that's crazy! who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
white meat will be fine...
how long?
is there a fire, then?
what is it my child?
who's in charge then, where is chinn?
by the x. that's were two lines cross -- forming an x.
why?
you heard of harry lonsdale? otherwise known as back-you-up with-a- hatchet harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
dick.
in the old series we didn't have a convertible.
yeah.  the fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
no, not "oh, so loosely"!  real specifically!  is that how you see us?
shoot!!!!
god, yes!
no. no, it's okay.
she's the boss.
with them?
well not far, just down the hall. plus grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
i said.  i serve the queen.
from high school mary? yeah, i saw her about six months ago at a convention in las vegas.
yeah. it is.
paris is evacuated, sire.  the enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  the national guard is on duty at the gates.
yes, sir. i had to go to the bathroom.
i can see it in your eyes.  you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
where's the ether? this mescaline isn't working.
but, paulie, please.
i'm -- sorry, i --
i'll be back before you leave.
we have some bourbon - lets make manhattans.
what?
just remember that when you sign for the tip.  they're paying for it, so don't be shy.
yes, sir.
all i know is--he said to me tonight-- "what does your wife think?" my wife. thinks we're married--
well, yes, i'm killing time.  i have a client near here and i...i'm quite early.
i'm happy here, where i'm supposed to be.  but if you ever become a catholic, may i ask you a favor, maggie?
what's your story, baby?
i have eyes too, and i tell you no one's there. if you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then i'm afraid i shall have to punish you. do you understand?
where'd you come from?
she's a transvestite.
pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... onyx is the sickle, death...
don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, i'll take gordon.
c-c-coll- college audiences are so wonderful.
jah...
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. but you did it. with work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. if that's what you want to be.
whatiya mean?
it's not a good idea, hallie.
i came to say goodbye.
maybe you should sleep with the judge too. then we can win the case.
anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
yeah, but what are you doing out here?
oh. the bullets.
i don't know. there were others much closer. he was religious?
okay, ann, okay. how about this: you buy her something nice, and i'll pay for half. all right?
no. poetic justice, though.
see where cable junction is?  look to the left.  the lighthouse.  that's it.
maybe bellmoth. maybe the unions. i don't know.
a path!  a little path for the late knights of ni!
shut up, it is. i told dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, i'd spew burrito chunks.
so, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
yes, sir.
i know.
yes.
let's find out.
how well did you know stacy and rod?
unfortunately, don colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  are you familiar with the work of aristotle?  erathostene?  ptolemeus?
unbelievable. look... here.  i don't know what's going on. that's so much baloney. i've got enough cash for one night, okay?
as far as we know, nothing.
you think i'm pushy now, wait 'til i get you on the stand...
no, not just that.
i'm here about some monkeys.
sorry to barge in on you. anybody else here besides you two?
yes, maybe that is better.
i don't know, dad doesn't either.
well, what about all your other friends?
you shut your face --
who are they?
baby? and what baby is that?
i think i'm gonna move back east.
ssshhh!  we say op.  covert					* operation.  and this one got a little rough.
we are animals after all.
don't you think i have any feelings? what am i?  a bowl of fruit?  a tangerine that peels in a minute?
what are you talking about?
the first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
you shared it with a dick.
we were right!
i do? well, thank you! you like ceilings?
tell me.
he must be replaced.
you're done yakkin', okay? you're done yakkin' now?
nothing to do with me?  i'm your brother for christ's sake.  god, i don't believe this.  talk to him, will you?  or hit him.  oh no, don't tell me...
what does it say?
i am about this.
it's very bad this.  terrible sad. such a young man.
listen, there's things i can take and a couple things i can't and one of them i can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything i want to be, starts losing faith in things. i saw your eyes last night.  i don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? i'm serious.
it was only a scratch. far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
i forgive you.
look, andrea, i'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. but there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
a tractor beam...
heavens! the man's insane!
they're biblical. they were prophets.
and where exactly does that put your position...?
i'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
i didn't say nothin', boss.
well cheer, why don't you? no more responsibilities, mary. marcia -- elaine -- me -- all taken care of. down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
but he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the russians.  he meets marina, whose uncle is a colonel in soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
there's something very dangerous about her. something evil...
you didn't even have a honeymoon. i promised you . . .  . . . your what?
cole, that's very wrong. grandma's gone. you know that.
i can't believe it.
huh?
what can you do?
all y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
what do you want to do?
my father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man i ever knew.
how do i stop it?
for your wife?
people end up in occupations for a reason. they may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
turn it off....
uh huh.  want me to lose them?
oh, you've thought of everything. and champagne.
what about mrs. marschal?
what did they say?
ha!  what a load of crap.  look at yourself, caesar.  you're a thug. |you launder money for the mob.  you rent women like you rented this apartment.
in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
what's the blue book price?
me, too.
need we go through it all again?
a little business move i made.  on my own.  i think you're gonna approve.
the knife slices into maureen again...then again. the theatre audience is starting to take note as the ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. a horrifying, sickening sight.
save us all a lot of trouble.
who the fuck you kidding?  send me money!
well...
i'd do that --
that's it.  my life.
taking forever. i just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before monday. i don't know how i'm going to do it.
i'm surprised donna didn't say anything.
and it had diamonds in the back.
i need ...unguent.
oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
you're kidding.
ooh, the sister! she is hot.
i don't.  patrick doesn't.  and his brother and sister don't.  and they're in the house with him.
that's okay...
you sure you don't want something stiffer?
can i trust you, sami?
i am the walrus.
she's absolutely r...
uh, "no"... you're not fat.
so you're just attracted to me, is that it?
smile.
in his name??
i'd kill ya.
i'll call an ambulance.
you're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  not a dictator over subjects?
mr. lynch, i swear to you, he's lying!
i've all ready gone six hundred miles... i can't do it again.
one...i can take care of myself. i grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and i've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. mickey knox doesn't scare me. two...i'm a journalist, and i'm prepared to take that risk. three...it ain't gonna happen. believe me when i tell you, it is in mickey knox's own best interest to play this game according to hoyle.  wait a minute. we've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what i want.  but seriously, phil, look at this.
no, kisses to...
it will be all right, madam.
they just want you to hire some new help.
give who a tail?
i haven't. no.
bravo.
a steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all i wanted.
i'm thinking about when this war is over. why you figure i'm here?  'cause i got tired of being president of gm?  if a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and i'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. so i say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what i say.
when you put your mouth to his, susan, it seems a frequent thing.
sit down and eat. till i say the word, you're doing what you're told.
yeah, first and second.
<<belch>>
mama is keeping score.  frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
and she began to cry.  and you put an arm around her.
as you please.
you called me jeffrey.
what do you mean? you've never been there.
no.
sorry, i need everybody.
sheriff, may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates, turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion?  watch your ear, creek.
who is this.
he's in the bathroom.
how are we going to find him?
kobayashi.
frank galvin. we've met before.
wasn't it like eighth grade?
he's a guest in my house, isn't he?
yeah, right.
so what?
loved?
are you going to quit? my last bodyguard quit.
i just - hate it when they're - finished.
yes... i'll give you that.
hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  and everyone, including your family, will find peace. will i just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
you don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
aye, sir --
yes.
you should be more careful.
nope, i couldn't care less.
did they have any explanation for this?
you're doing fine.
we're in motion on something.
no. but it's weird. she seemed to recognize me.
allegedly, what i am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if i had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
yes, she did.
somebody's been sending me love letters. commissioner gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
fuck you, asshole.
just your imagination.
been here long?
i love you, zoe.  i'll be there soon, and i'll take care of you.  no matter what happens.  i'll take care of you.
i don't want to talk about it.  so what happened to your neck?
i can just hear you now. "get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! you're too good for me!"
there has to be!
yeah, but i don't know what.
chingachgook's of the same opinion. taken together, that's gospel. your fort will stand or fall depending on webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
the what.  i've kind of run away from home, you see.  it has nothing to do with my parents or money. i saw something i wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that i keep myself out of sight.
is it a problem for you to ask?
rules are rules.
they think we like it.  maybe they think it turns us on.
jesus, man, you look terrific. you must have put on twenty pounds.
real polite. kept calling me 'sir.'
you can cut out the sir, lance -- i'm bill kilgore -- i'm a goofy foot.
he was in love with you, right?
how about squeezing him through into dartmouth? if all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
not possible..
worse.
i'm sorry, jim.  i can't talk now. i'll call you tonight...i'm sorry. i'm coming, ray. 
have the child taken to bed.
i'm not that bad a driver.  look at her hair!  turn it off, honey.
yeah, that's it.
what's the hurry?
and you can see how you feel about me, right?
if san antonio sweeps sacramento...
go power rangers!
you can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. pick the lock, malcolm; pick it.
no you're not –  you're glad, because now you've got a witness.  i heard the other police talking last night.  they don't seem to like you very much.
i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up.  i asked him not to tell.  i didn't think he would tell anybody.
what the hell happened?
she's a little jealous, i think. and confused when it comes to men...  so where are we going?
yes.
i'll think about it.
what night?
hi.
lift up your pant leg. you help her?
hold on –
well done, james.
huh? -- what's that?  well -- what about it? who cares, anyhow?
wire pull over?
knock it off, burt!
hush!
hmmm?
you hate him?
down... there.
yeah. marvin's old man gunned him down.
romeo. wit, swordsman, lover.
and he's a patient of yours?
we've struck ice.
yes.
cut! print it! what happens in the next reel? do i get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
it's locked.
have fun storming the castle.
bullshit --
yes, miss betsy.  i mean that.  the houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to shango and damballa.
what?
me, neither. i don't eat meat.
not my imports.
i have a son of my own. about you boy's age. i can imagine how painful this must be for you. but clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. and i implore you not to go down the road with 'em. you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
a dead one.
don't mention it.
they're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
you're so predictable.
this one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
here's twenty-five thousand.
i'd like to jerk and press those babies.
aye, aye, sir.
is it still dripping?
fine, dixie. fine.
<i>                      now in the box, we'll wait and hide until his curiosity entices him to look inside...</i>
give it back to me.
annabelle pick up the phone.
that can't be!  everything has an antithesis!  why not this?
you know, i've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. nothing penetrates that night. nothing.
she won't talk to me. she says she has to speak to you.
fine. and here's a kiss for you.
and i don't like paranoid accusations! i'm a journalist. think. use your head. how do i operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
yeah...you a witch?
brody...i don't know...  ...something brody!
-  we thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
are you sure?
we were just riding around.
here. we'll collect them.
hm.  is it?
what's good about that?
now, nuke, would i do a thing like that?  hey kids, this is the great ebby calvin "nuke" laloosh.
because we're being hunted.  from the bushes straight ahead.
a window onto the human condition?
well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
nothing new. he's just going off duty.
forget about it.
as soon as i get to the bottom of this, i'll get the next plane.
where were you tuesday night?
well, what about <u>these</u>?  do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
yeah.
show him.
[do you ever see the hand of god in what you do?]
rudder's left, stick's forward.
it's my control board and i don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
do you know where he's living?  oh....  well, at least i'm glad he's all right.  thank you for calling. goodbye.
what guarantees can i give you?  i am the hunted one.  i've missed my chance.  you think too highly of me, my friend...i am not so clever...all i want if a truce...
do you have any news regarding my father's money?
it's better than ice cream.
great. fine... once or twice it did fall off the blocks. i don't know what that's from.
it is?
i, uh.
did you know that arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  you realize what would happen if this fort fell?  the whole hudson would be open to them!
happy anniversary, baby.
elvis is still in there!  it's gonna go off!
was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied madame bonaparte's coach?
well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. they may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'bye.
on earth -- no.  but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna.
i'm angry because i want a mother, not martha stewart.
you do that.
they can stay for two weeks. i don't care.
why don't we just take these -
bullshit.  john.  bullshit.  april, september 1981.  it's me.  it isn't fucking moss.  due respect, he's an order taker, john.  he talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, john, it's me...
they're fine. my old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--i was sort of born to it, i guess.
the best explanation is always the simplest one. let's wait. let's wait and see. in the meantime try not to worry.
mom's orders.
elaine, talking to you now, not as viktor, director, but viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
it's very strange. how many people are truly themselves with their love? it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. there are no marches against heartache, no ministries against loneliness, no concerts against disappointment. we look away. and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. the one thing we all share but don't say. look john i will show you something.
you were there, jerry.  figure it out.
it's a great shirt. don't worry about it.
ah, now, that's better.
why did gregory ask me out? i mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
okay... i promise.
so do i.  sort of.
yeah.  but you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
are you sure we should be driving like this?  in broad daylight and everything?
doesn't matter.  doesn't make one bit of difference.  oh god, george, how'd this happen to me? how'd i end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
think nothing of it, spanky.
it would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
who's thorwald?
i understand, cynthia and thank you for the offer. i'll find a place. now go ahead and give the cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
we should be.  everybody wants what we have.
then why does she act so dumb?
i dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
aw, i conned a senator from florida on a stocks deal.  a real lop-ear. he thought he was gonna take over general electric.  some chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
why should you do that?
what do you mean?
they've been in there all day.
i know jesus says to love our enemies but i can't -- i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever!
where... can i stay?
i'm just trying to help you, sayer. i don't want you to be disappointed.  it gets cold out here at night.
great. battling head doctors. we'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. hung jury.
someone's chasing him.
you want something done, j.j., but i doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
citizen bourrienne to see you, sir.
yeah--the blind foster home mother. it was good. i got cahoon on it.

i never knowed they was anything like her!
fairy tales?
basically broke down how i'm gonna make mad loot in the nba, me being such a limited commodity and all.
jason? he's on this ship?!
we're examined once a year. her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
i am sorry for all my sins.  and yours.
look, this party's whack.  you ready to go?
i've never been to louisville.
i fought for you... and i still fight for you.
i know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
i'll talk the way i want to. i've had enough of this.
you better be, motherfucker.
leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell jimmy. but you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. do you realize what leo could have told jimmy?! do you?!
god dammit! how'm i gonna got out of here?
francis? where are you?
oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
you ever done this before?
i don't know either. i think i'm a very nice guy. i also think i'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
hello, rachel. i'm selina.
cause burke and i are just friends. okay, really.
no. you won't be able to do it. he will rise. he will rise and you... you will die.
no, i'm not gonna take it.  if i take it i'll break my back.
i … her letter came to me by the nurse.
the photos.
you might want to check those duke university mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  we've had a lot of trouble.
regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  it's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
i dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. we've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
like what?
and whom would you call?
first you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  which is it?
...when i got outta the army, clara, i was lost. i didn't know what i wanted to do. i was twenny-five years old, what was i gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. i thought maybe i go to college under the g.i. biller rights, you know? but i wouldn't graduate till i was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if i made it in three years. and my brother freddie wanted to get married, and i had three unmarried sisters -- in an italian home, that's a terrible thing. and my kid brother nickie, he's a one got married last week. so i just went to pieces. i used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. my mother used to be so worried about me. my uncle mario come over one time. he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. he got his own cab, you know. and god forgive me for what i'm gonna say now, but i used to thinka doing away with myself. i used to stand sometimes in the subway, and god forgive me what i'm going to say, i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
what the fuck is that supposed --
no problem. you go on off to bed.
if we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
you see? thea believes it, too!
i know he's boring but... neuro-specialists!  that sounds pretty drastic.
it seems to me we are just sailing away. they haven't sunk us yet, have they? besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  it's all been taken care of.
nothing's going to happen.
do what?
on the other hand -  i am the publisher of the enquirer. as such, it is my duty - i'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, god help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  i'll let you in on another little secret, mr. thatcher.  i think i'm the man to do it.  you see, i have money and property -
i'm not that good.
they used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. some still do --
why am i gonna mention your name?
hardly. who's the girl?
i have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  bu sometimes - uh - i speculate - uh - i haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
save your breath. that line doesn't cut it with me.
you do?
oh jesus.  oh jesus christ.
okay. all right.  and what do i say?
i don't know what we'd have done without you.
i can't let my lunch hour go on too long. i've already skipped one meeting.
for a butt-head? yes.
long ago -- before my father's father.
oh, no!
dear david, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. the school term will begin september 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. i do hope everything is fine and you will be here. give my "hello" to your family. yours truly, miss camille johnson...
where?
oooh. sassy. what do you care who feels me up, jake? unless it kinda gotcha going. did it, jake? getcha going?
not with the wine list these people have. we don't want to hold back.
you did?  why? where were you? they said you left hours ago. we were worried.
oh. it never crossed my mind.
i can't open it.
i am nina ivanovna yakushova, envoy extraordinary, acting under direct orders of comrade commissar razinin. present me to your colleagues.
oh that's just fucking great! where's brown?
we've just been talking to young--
i don't know.
canadian club?
then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the asylum's equipment- test list. maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "saturation chamber."
why didn't you fade?
i care about you, a - but i just don't have those kind of feelings for you. i'm sorry. i'm not in love with you.
you do that, edward.
i don't know... you sure tom said it's all right?
fine. fine.
dad, i love him.
that's good. they're allowed, but i don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. one man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. you wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
it's too...
y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the wall of fame?
if they were in stasis, i'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. it doesn't make any sense.
right.
ww beauchamp... little bill daggett and... "friends."
barzini.
i don't know.  but if this is a sample of american diplomacy i'm buying a fallout shelter.
you know, did he seem depressed? do you think he'll eat the food?
the barretts from rubicon bay came by in a new speedboat.  rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  that was three hours ago.
i ain't never going back to that school, sir.
i'll hack the gibson.
i mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. i mean. no offense.
i assume his girlfriend.
very clever.
don't you see? jason was _asleep_. and he was dreaming -- the rem patterns prove that. and i saw finger blades just like krueger's come out of jason's chest. there has to be a connection.
a rose by any other name would --
melina, please...people are trying to kill me.
he was here?
no, you can't. look, as soon as i tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
uh-huh.
so what?!  so fucking what?  use your head, violet.  the money is gone.  gino is coming here to get it.  you think he's going to believe me if i tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  is that what you think? i don't.  you know what i think?  i think i'm a dead man.  i'm one in the brain.  that's what i think!
you have me confused with dan dailey. you go sit by the piano.  and you come sit by me.  good night.
that's just it. it makes people feel queer. i dont' want you to get in any trouble.
it was quite a page turner.
that one time was just the bumper.
what, you think i did this to myself?
come on guy, you know i only rib you because i love you so much!
bingo!
no. loretta called. there's been a... a fire.
the only thing you can do.  you must end it.
any of 'em any good?
there's somebody else on this boat.
the fat man on cherry street.  the other fat man, mr. bulldozer.  the trumpet player.  that leaves two.
look, i know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that i'm a woman and that you're a --
if i've got it right, my lord, you lead an invasion into zululand, for i see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
that's 'cause i was cursed with the sultenfuss bear claws.  my hands fit.
listen, stupid - right now spats colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
i'm not going -- you know i'm not going -- let me stay here?
yeah it turned out okay.  we applied for a national historical plaque for it.  that'll be the third one on main street.
do i set the goddam hook?
if they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  you the replacement for the bass and the sax?
heard that.
oh anywhere - whenever i needed to - do you know how easy it is to take them? you just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'look, i have something to show you' i would say - and that would be it. one girl, i think her name is debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and i offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - she just got in and i drove away. when i pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - i said, you know what i want. - but she didn't. getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first i cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off eldridge bridge in broad daylight.  the real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. it made such a mess of
magnificent. you are the first to find me.
...got a strange call from the sec. they asked to see my records... bud, this is a heavy...
yes. it is.
don't mention me.
mark in the morning! magic 96.7! oh my god! i'm karla. karla wilson.  jules, it's mark in the morning.
oh my god, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my god!
he grabbed me! he held me! he set me down gently! how could that be done with mirrors?
jill.
there's so much i want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and i don't want her to misunderstand --
how about major moron?
great.
yes. exhilarating, isn't it!
they're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
big enough radio, i don't see why not.
shut up.
i do not seek forgiveness.
it seemed that way to me.
yes. and do try to keep all four of them on the road.  all the usual refinements: smoke, missiles, machine guns -  fully operational remote control. drives forward, reverse -  stop that!  plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
no.
that's right.  c.d.c. found out and closed them down...
that'll be a test, won't it?
you were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
will you buy the sheep for me?
i fell asleep.
no. he knows no one in london, besides me. i shouldn't have left him alone.
sounds good. oblique but intriguing. phone it in.
you see the bullet?
i'm going to school. maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
mrs. lampert? -- bartholomew. i've spoken to washington, mrs. lampert --
i'm tired.  really.  i should get home.
it was i who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  i could have gone on witn my career, only i found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  you see, i was her rirst husband.
she doesn't know. she thinks i fell down the stairs.
yes. viktor davidov, miss...?
they're gone.
come now. magnus? agrippa? next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
no, i'm having a heart attack. of course, i'm ok. what's that supposed to mean?
i guess gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
barton, honestly, only the last couple-
front armor is gone! just slow it down a little!
yeah.  it bothers me when cops get hurt while i'm makin' a play. i don't like it.
why should i stay here, jeff? so we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about burnfield?
what's the rush?
you're making my life difficult.
that's really great.
uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on daddy's face, i wanna do some appraising.
all of us.
you'd probably tell me.
i don't mind if i do.
you see? life can be so simple.
-- yeah -- one guy -- i don't think he was ready --
craig, listen, honey, i've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
i beg your pardon?
negative. cancel it.
no, i do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new buicks?
do i look like i'm movin'?!  what you're seeing here?  this is not movement. this is my "still".
relax ... it was fifteen years ago. i don't do it now.
no -- no, i'm don't.
in about fifteen minutes.
do what? i don't know. i'm no good at this.
the shazzammeter!
uh...yeah. it's like hard.
okay.
i'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. it's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn teldar paper around, what do i need this dink airline for? i'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
toi.  they've been 'going out' for two weeks.
he's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
for sure...
gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
no. <u>knots</u>!
i'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
slow down, george.  slow down.
the television said they've started with the looting already. vultures.
time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
a cold drink? you mean one cold drink? to feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on the picture? a true vision of paradise itself? with two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
we can't sell out to those guys. they ain't businessmen!
i take it you are referring to the ludovico technique?
michael...
stan?! you started la resistance?
then feel better!..
even if all this were true. there're 20 other buildings. all of them filled with computers and --
good lord.  how'd you get it on tape?
is that ok?
air france. glasgow. direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. that's nine one two. it's up to you.
helen, she sent along your things with a note, and john here, he wrote to the police.
did she?  you were pretty thick at one time.
poppea.  she was his wife.  and she was unfaithful to him.  so he got mad and he jumped on her.  up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  please don't jump on me.
twelve years in prison is no joke.
no, it's not.  it's for this.
maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
tell you what. you get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
and if i had to guess by your eyes. i'd say you were kind. so, so much for eyes. but as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. if the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream. the experience becomes real.
hey!--you're tickling me.
dad around?
hannah and i...can't have any children.  now i-i-i don't want to get into whose fault it--  it's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
it is every woman's problem.  who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  who...
i don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
it won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  mr. robard?  could you locate him?
lenny, it's teddy. look, stay there, okay? i'm gonna be right over.
great!
what the hell are you talking about? what's happening.
i'm telling you what i was told by my uncle. and he should know. he ran half a dozen men's clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
don't worry about that. you'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
did you tell veronica?
there's something black in the green part of your eye.
except --
against your code?
oh, no! she hasn't been here at all! i would have seen her, you know. i've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
no, i did not.
did he say what about?
what now?
--can we use their names?--
look! look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. it'll turn up in our bed at night.  will you get outta here with that thing? jesus!
just tell me.  tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared. what kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  what the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
is spanky here?
ben, i'm afraid i've got to ask --
yes, father.
where's the office?
maybe just one word? kaput? because you're kaput, price.
she came here. we'll just wait. in the meantime, i need you to shimmy through.
how could you have done that?
-- it's called a projector.
i can't tell you.
yeah? if this be execution, lead me to it.
play it, sam. play "as time goes by."
valentine, listen to me ...
yeah.
you think i can't learn that?
dissent?
is there anything you don't jerk off to?
david isn't hiding from me, i left him standing at the altar six years ago and now i'm...
look, you don't understand.  i need a job.  i've got a kid and--
that aside for the moment, i'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  in my seven years on this committee, i've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  never.  i'm deeply disturbed by this report, mr. hayes.  not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
it's beautiful...
i didn't know that. see? you _are_ interesting. and call me chase. by the way, do you have a first name? or do i just call you bats?
shhhhh!
<u>he</u> does. here's your quarter, brett.
it's not the police. it's the department of transport. internal politics. it's a joke. they have no idea who we really are
oh yeah,...i mean no. no! i won't settle down! not this time!...
i'm not sure.
did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
no shit... i think i shot the hell out of him.
what do you have, a fucking water pistol?  get him back!
don't worry about me, mr. general director pryesing -- worry about yourself.  there has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
...no.
i just need to go a little slow.
where...here?
me?
i did not mean to weep again. why should i weep for joy?
she was sleeping with everybody. the cable tv guy. you can't get lower than that...
what about citrine?
get out!
what?
don't listen to him. it's him. he's the one.
whether i am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
i saw a statue once called the third time phyllis saw me she exploded.
may<u>be</u>.
yeah?
how be dat?
i already did. what's his problem?
please, please.
did he say who?
sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. i expected that you would want to speak to me about it. but you could have come to my office. your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, sister, have done something wrong. you haven't. i assure you. i feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. if you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
the plane is in at seven, so i'd say about eight.
how do you know you can trust me?
no.
but julie's a nice girl, and i've seen you work.  she deserves a fighting chance!
"to daddy from amy." here's one for miss callahan. this one says, "to edward from amy.".
right now, it doesn't seem so.
no, i want my cut!
come on, margo.  we're on the verge of something huge.  let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  what if john was right.  i mean, what if?  and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  when it got to the museum, it hatched.
wow, this is so cool...
i want to talk.  i just learned again.
this was your garden?
i doubt it. [beat] i don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  if woodward and bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in hollywood with me.
this way?
ah, ya know.  neighborhood's not what it used to be.  kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
what?
that was before twombley was shot. before he knew.
without the glasses you're not even ugly.  i don't need them because i never read. how do i look.
and there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into rose's bedroom in the dark of night! i am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all i am going to do!
whaddaya talkin' about? there's at least twenty guys in there. let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
i did?
don't apologize, please.  i can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
you're welcome. i was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
and have you mended them?
christ, and i even know somebody at the phone company--
how, dick?  the way <u>you</u> earned it?  by marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  what is this knute rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  you were a goddamn dumpling.  maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  till you <u>were</u> nothing.  i saved your ass.  so you'll pardon me if i don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  okay, dick?  i can't do it.
yesterday...
i know.
oh, he's fine! i just heard from him. he's bombing all these places...
that tube must be depositing it in him.
oh, yes, indeed. i look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. the debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
it's like ringing the dinner bell.
think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
yeah, luckily.
no....i though  i'm afraid.
anyways, what i'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... i love you.
no, man, i mean it. you're a good writer. i remember those things you'd write during honors english. funny shit.
there i was taxed; it's true.
to warn him.
oh, jesus.
i know, dad.  i know...
i gotta go, flip.  thanks.
stop whispering, sweet pea, you're giving me a hard on!
i count my blessings.
fuck off.  i don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
it's a rock. it doesn't have vulnerable spots!
it's kind of falling apart.
ok. marice why don't you take a seat for me?
he no longer works for me.  find susan's killer, mr. white. i'll give you a handsome reward. <u>whatever you desire</u>.
veronica is into his act. no doubt.
i know.
i think you should give up diving. it's dangerous.
hey, i just...
let's get something straight, jeff -- i never asked you to leave your wife.
i don't need a crazy woman in my life.
andy?
he's burning up.
what do you mean -- haywire? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. you're grand! i'm for you! stupendous!
you think?
that's the idea, general schmuck.  zlat!
its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
--we could bum around the world for a year on that.
could you believe mr. blonde?
i, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
i'll make it a dollar.
'beware romulans bearing gifts.' happy birthday...
and hu li killed him for the plates.
frida, i don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about pms around men.
he's not a kill, he's still alive.
yeah.  it was all over after buford nailed seaver's first pitch outta the park.
"so help me god."
have you questioned him yet?
i keep thinking about him.
uh... gym.
you don't have to make any decisions tonight.
it's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
somebody has to!
yeah, well... hi...
how's that working out for you?
do you think they'll go along with us?
always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
well, joe said it, and he's right.
shit.
first of all, i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "enquirer."
gimme the black guy...
just be patient.
he tried to disconnect rok.  it gassed him.  that computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
isn't that sweet.  well it could be any one of them bubi; i get to see them all.
what happened?
austin, i have something for you as well.
'81, i think.  she tried again five years ago.  i thought you should know.
it's a surprise.
all of us.
you never know.
w-w-whatta you mean?
you're a tough nut to crack, dylan.
do you have bad dreams, too?
when do you need her by?
i wanna let my brother know where i am.
no, no, that'll be fine. i don't mind. sure.
for months... last october.
he said something about a girl --
don't know if god wanna see me.
the blue.
huh?
i get off work in fifteen minutes. walk me home?
why?  it's fine.  it's nice.
how the hell should i know how much?
yeah, i'll hitch a ride or something. [beat] let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
yes i am.
i don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
no i'm not.
does the pope shit in the woods?
my gosh, and for a while there, i was attracted to you.
this might do ... i don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  we're trying to keep our costs down.  you know how it is when you're starting a new company.
you gave it your best shot.  you tried.
i'm not sick.
there are no locks anywhere in this house.
they seem to like the idea.
what happened to you?
no. i'm glad i'm home.
you will know.  when you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense.  never for attack.
i'm the one sent you to toronto, bernstein--
we're taking the body back to portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
to what?  trap him?
nice.
wait, let's do this right. do you have any candles?
my guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
oh --
you spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  oh good.
what--
chief inspector lee will brief your people...
the mondrian, room 504. the number is 266 7548, plus the l.a. code...
it sounds nice.
why get rid of her at al1? you've used the coffer of shadow too much.  it is beginning to rule your heart.
i don't know...  me.
that's the last time you rode, isn't it?  do you think it was your fault?  is that why?
yes.  very much.
yeah, but aligning with white organizations. i'm not sure now's the time.
i know parts of who you are.
and do you amuse the guests?
we're getting that anyway.
we told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. just to look from up there. we came and... the driver of my ship...
arnie, this is crazy.
put a diaper on him, chin.  i want to talk to the great inspector lee.
you know what i'm gonna do.
about half of them. a lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
breathe deeply.
very well.
yes, honey.  i think we both can.
okey-doke.
no jean, no money!
do you love your father?
can you get us in there, past security?
get out.
of course.
being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico?
easy, dad!
no bother.
well, i kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
don't flatter yourself.... 
for when i travel?
up the stairs, keith. the door on the right.
twenty-six.
well, i'll be an alabama porch monkey's uncle.
in ruhengeri?
yes.  or forward into the future. i suppose i really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
beautiful.
your excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. here they are. i don't have to tell you how much i need your help. i truly appreciate your looking at these. i have pressures on me - financial pressures. as you know, i'm a married man now.
the coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and i mean every little fuckin' thing too.
aye, aye sir. stand by to repel boarders. poop the mainsail. argh, jim boy.
she's fine.
no, of course not.  she's one of the top students at her school.
what, and miss all the fun?  c'mon, not a chance.  so, what's the verdict?
yes.
excuse me one second, would you, gabrielle?
i left my pomade in that car! maybe i can creep up!
mom, please.
quiet!
well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
i'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
calm down.  why would they keep playing after you paid?
yeah, they're good. they're good, tommy.
estes! that's exactly who it is. that old guy knows something. we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
i see.
you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? the fittings alone could go for a few million.
lydia, i went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
laughs.
i can't enjoy anything. i go fishing. i catch nothing. i go to orgies, i catch everything...
brad. i don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
no, we have nothing to hide.
i bet 235.  because i dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when i dreamt...
no shit! that why they call him ice?
what are you tired from?
she must be some girl.
andy, it's not so easy. there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under paris. it's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... it's no man's land.
i didn't see him !
i love your early work. "was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium?"
no.  that's not going to tell us anything.  let's get this prompter going.
now there's a coincidence. my father used to gamble there.
we're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'reform the reds with a rope'.
what?
you see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
you know, i'd take you up on that in a minute.  i'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
so that is your house?
highly suspect.
exactly!
the thing with dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
he's very interesting. for all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
one-seven-four-nine-five natoma.
would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
what else can they do?
shhh.  it's okay.  just breathe. i'll fix it...
i know what you're saying, man. i don't know what to tell you...
who the fuck is it to you?
enterprise, i want that signal again. transmit!
"oh!?" what is "oh?" what does "oh" mean?
you're kidding! like what?
eighteen.  and it's "hebrew".
well, you certainly had a good look around.
are we going to do this again?
but why would andy want me?
that's a bozo no-no.  jay-bird.
what do you mean...
even nuns have to pee.
indeed. risc architecture is gonna change everything.
lancelot, i will save you... don't die.
what plates?
it'll take the pain away.
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
do you want to sleep on it?
i don't know -- the gym, the fights. i <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  having some tomorrow night at the state theater.  he use to take me.
you forgot her degree in literature. she's a writer.  she published a novel last year under a pen name. do you want to know what it's about?
mike, what can i do, she's a hysterical woman...
how do you know she did that?
somebody told me nathan was back. how is he?
she was happy here.  however the two of you might have parted.  don't think she wasn't.
could she be doin' okay, johnnie? she's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  johnnie, i've done somethin' bad...
oh, thank god. it's going.
poison never agrees with me.  pull a right, short round, and head for the wang poo bridge!
yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
something like that.
ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. this is nick's room and uhh....
well it's been a while, but i don't recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
what are you going to do?
no one does nothing, jeff.
it can be dangerous...
an animal that doesn't procreate. it spreads, grows. a living disease.
in my room.
turn it off, lex!  turn it off!
what about it, diz ?
listen up, jiggaboo! state of mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
he shot the chancellor's dog, didn't he? the blind one.
you can have anything you want.
what kind of people?
they're forged.
my father is watching the businessman. the businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. they think he's been murdered.
how do you know i won't run?
you listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. he's got the rale, he's very weak, and i don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
i an' i, case. jah guides us.
de-la-croix.
i'm afraid we can't let you go.
i want to go home, merle.
it's early for him.
i can't wear anything under it. that would spoil the line.
well, i've seen him here and there. what's on your mind?
fine.  i'm fine.
aye, i do, peter.
you know what? i...
you know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, user said to go take that sucker out. an' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. i feel like hittin' him now, while i'm good an' mad. some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
i don't think they're in school.
please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... we've had a wonderful time together... when we first met, you said this wasn't serious and i shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. and i just wanna say that i have no regrets.  none.  and don't wanna have any now so i want ya to be up front with me... i want the truth. if you're seein' somebody else, let me know... you don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  just tell me the truth.
what was her name?  the one i met.
gwen. the show. there's no choice. do it.
what?
supportive?  you weren't being supportive.  you were being scared. just like now.  you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on.
i neither enjoy nor dislike. i do what is necessary.
put the sense/net police on it. the matrix is their turf.
same way they did with you and me. we take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
you look upset.
oh, he's not the man for you. i can see that. but i sort of like him. got a lot of charm.
yes.
don't be silly...i'm old.  don't look at me like that, please.  why'd you come back?
alright. 'bye, buff.
fill it up.
huh.  problem is, jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  it's all he's ever done.
they're punks.  nazis.  their brains are wired wrong.  they hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. they just want to get radical.  it's mindless aggression.  they'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
jogging. i was running, now i'm jogging.
hi.
that's all right.
in those days, they often worked as a team.
i mean, you're really back.
int. darlene's store - day.
that's cool.
oh that's just beautiful! all the scumbags in the quiet city of boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! greenly, the day i want the boston police doing my thinking for me, i will have a fucking tag on my toe! now, get me a squad car and get me over there. i want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. now!
got the information on you?
okay, okay.  i can explain... you ever have to do something you really don't want to?
what i know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, i don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. are we being neighbors for now?
how long will this take?
it's like hiding from my mother when i was a little girl.
yeah, i said i - let the bullshit blow over for a while so i can run the casino. anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. it's not yours, it's my ass.
yeah.
come on, it's graduation.
you see, my wife -- i mean, your wife -- that is, i mean hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
when's the audition?
how are you, mr. kross.
why no silencer?
klupner.  mrs. klupner.
i'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  it's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
he was a freak.  everything he did was tainted.
wipin' little circles with his bread.
i don't like it.
the seven ceos of big tobacco... they got up in front of congress that time... it was on television...
alexander.
you know nothing.  what you don't know would fill a book.  jesus, i feel like it's when you're around i need it most.  you're never yourself, you never relax.  never. everything's so stiff and dead. you always have to keep a rein on everything, ever yourself.  oh, you smile sometimes, i've even seen you laugh.  but there's no light in your smile for me, wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. and i get cold, wyatt.  i get so cold.  what's between you and that jew woman?
e mo va! [italian-american slang for 'now, go!']
10 years ago? halloween? he's jamie's uncle.
please, george. i don't want to talk about it anymore.
for the same reason, herr chamberlain, that it was banned in france.
what they like then?
ready?
ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  may it ever be so adventurous!
they are primitive, lara, but they are not animals.
i know who you are.
i don't know.  what are they?
the hell is that?  what kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
honey, i have to ask you this... is santos involved in any of this?
do you know them?  i made him some noodles for dinner. you can heat them up and --
who the hell is this "they?"
you can do anything you want.  hop in.
my son, no one can speak for god.
always.
no, sweetie, not yet.
i know.
joseph miller, your honor. macready and shilts legal services.
oh, yeah? it's all right with me. go on out in the storm, but i'm going to follow you, see?  yeah. and if you get tough i'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. savvy?  now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. a simple story for simple people. now if you behave yourself, i'll see that you get to king westley; if not, i'll just have to spill the beans to papa. now which of these beds do you prefer? this one? all right.
you're being paranoid.
oh.  um, i'm ed wood!  so, what are you working on now?
i beg your pardon?
they're not picking me up until six.
you mean -- worried about my testimony?
to calm your anxiety.
looks like another schizoid embolism.
well, let's do it.
one of them, anyway...  did you see it?  the screamer?
one loud scream will bring them in here instantly. you won't get very far. think it over.
oh, they knew.  they had to know.
his rug.
twenty-two years ago.
i'm worried about you.
she's not been here for a long time.
and what do we do when we find it?
it's fantastic -- it's too much.
a man wouldn't do that...
well, he's killing now.
well, he's young and he's healthy.
and the, uh, the briefcase?
there was so much going on.
arnie, help me.  doesn't anyone owe us money?
plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where i keep 'em.
here's hoping, baby...
you?  why?  since when have you become the protector of little children?
i told you a lie. we'll make it easily. margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
i thought 4th brigade cleaned out p.
thank you. it is rather late... and i'm not young anymore. good night.
for that matter, i might as well be a girl scout tonight. i plan on making popcorn and watching doctor dementia. six straight hours of horror movies. little lindsey wallace won't know what hit her.
that depends.
that's where you got the idea?
abby...
you know.
why?
what'd he get?
you must get lonely. you ever think about, you know... 
well... er... i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
be careful.
what?
yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
oh, you. you talk same as you write.
not yet.
the old viktor taransky.  i liked you better before -- before all this.  you were a loser, dad, but at least you had integrity.  i can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  and then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
congratulations. the la guardia flight’s canceled but i got you out of kennedy on united at nine. am i good or what?
you look good, jeffrey. did you have a nice flight?
and?
my word is good, and it'll always be good. when did i ever give my word to you?
don't say anything else.
stop -- singing!!!
but he never talked.
well you could've at least warned me.  you know i hate the zap... when they die.  it just brings down your whole day.  jeez, tick.
that's nice.
what other boat?
give me twenty minutes.
did you say after midnight?
i'm happy enough.
that--or he's out blazing trails. he'll show up.
"sources revealed an fbi investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
cash poor?
okay. fine. understood.  i'm off then.
i could go with you.
yes i did...
just a second.  hello?
joey never told you we went out, did he?
you don't think i've tried? no one is willing to open the picture
oh yeah? why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? the poison needles?
but i won't.
oh.  i wonder what's keeping mother? she was supposed to come down and get you.
i was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
why don't you try to sleep now, mrs. brenner.
what? don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
you just showing off for her!
maybe it's the draft through the door.
everything's kosher. watch him for me.
that's awful.
i bet my career on you. you'd better be good.
yeah.  there's still a lot i want to do.  it's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
well, for the same reasons we do, sir. don't you see?
i didn't see nothin'.
he would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in palm springs. he had a device he called the intruder.
but she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
i'll be right back. stay put.
well... then may you rent me your gear for the day?
he missed me.
suspended from school, my mother??
there's no need. i learned the craft from my 						grandmother.
what it be is, you aren't coming with us.
too late.  just my luck.
dunno...seems so.
what is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  you're a bus driver, "homes," you live in flatbush, so please don't start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too,
bullshit. you had a vision. you got sign from the old ones.
which parts?
i think you'll find it is in your interest.
maybe you're afraid of what it says.
i thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
joseph harbin.
could be. now that billy's tried to mutilate her, you think sid would go out with me?
well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. but if it really matters to you, i'11 call you...  toto!...
oh, yes, it's great.
no.  i'm just depressed.
i'm a agent as well. kgb. i've been undercover for over a year.
mmm.
no.
you don't have to tell me. it's written all over that pretty face of yours.. you came here to be an actress. i just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  the bowels of the ship.
but, i don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? i mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
i'm serious. we forget he's just a child. i wish you'd speak to him.
how are we doing?
no.
no.  i'm weird.  weird and mysterious are two different things.
i must be honest with you.  i first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
i taught you that.
nope. heard it. we wasn't far apart. i spotted this buck, then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone. i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. called it right in.
she's the one person i could always count on. and she's saved me more times than she realizes. i owe her everything.
sorry to disappoint you.  but rubber lips are immune to your charms.
why did he try to kill me?
mr. cedar!
i don't know. i don't know...
a gasket? reed, we're at a party.
[the what?]
and whose houses do you design...?
if you have, it isn't too late. you know how i feel about him. but i want to make you happy. you gave me such a scare—i—when i couldn't find you.  you know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
i don't know.  did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  if you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  a girl no one even remembers.
looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. what was the lady's name, mr. cluett?
mccay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
shit. i knew you were crazy.
sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. we got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
nothing.
how much do you think you'll need?
virginia?!
gladly, only i don't know what you want! you haven't told me.
oh.
i promise.
no.
there'll be a time.
they're going to love you.
swell!
if i did, i'd have to give you one, wouldn't i? or we could take what we want. no one knows how much there is except us, right?
who is this, right?  i called you last night.
i've been thinking about applying for federal service, too. fleet, maybe.
you were in the car with bob?
see you later.
i hope he got his mother's permission.
we're not supposed to think about it.  but i dream about it sometimes...
lunch?
try me.
well... the guy's fucked up.
in the middle of the night?
what the hell do you think? i love ann. you think i'm going to tell her about cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
they're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
they smell.
i know everybody says it, but i really mean it.
how do i look?
what happened on the charges?
good for you, lieutenant.
no.
i don't know <u>anything</u>.
what the fuck is going on?
did you think it was going to be easy? you think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
she likes you.  says you're dinky- dau.
an nsa surgeon gave me castor's face.  he handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  but somehow castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. but not before he was transformed into me.
yes.  i can even read star maps.
that's right.
i mean nothing. the hammer came down and nothing happened. dimple on the primer.
that's right.
man, what is this?
pass.
great. how??
the taj mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  why didn't he tell us?
walter.  he's been aimin' that brownie through knotholes for years.  i saw these, i knew he'd finally struck gold.  i can't decide which came out better, that little straw kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  what do you think, mr. lombardo?
i don't have a choice. keith's been grading me really hard lately.
night, honey.
probably didn't have time.
it's nothing.
pick a record.  i feel like dancing.
no, to you--m'sieu <u>monescu</u>.
the shiny stuff. the ice. the big, big, big money is available's what will the english says.
will you stop worrying! it was i who got old man semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? and who got the power of attorney from him ! all right, and i'll get it again!  i'll take it easy. those books'll never leave this office.
what?
yeah, yeah, sure.
yllo's dead. we...we thought you were too.
so, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, i don't think i can put you back in the classroom just yet.
oh really. why's that?
"security" is not strong enough.
oh yeah, he's good.

whose shoe?
yeah, that's right! i'm outta here -- y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... i'm gone with the wind.
is that what you want?
he's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  i mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
you like the women, don't you, wilhelm?
did you hear me?!
i must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
just a guy trying to put out a fire.
baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  how many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
we're ghosts.
how do you do.
yo, man, you an amateur, man.
to my weekly confession.
i thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
i admit he is very clever. three times he slipped through our fingers. in paris he continued his activities. we intend not to let it happen again.
you can shut up now.
the beach.
senorita josie.
what better place than this? to stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
how could i know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  right over my head. oh, my word! i tell you, those chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. i had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
he suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
no.  course not.
what color is it supposed to be?
can i--uh--help you gentlemen?
what?
you'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, doc?  if i was caught, wouldn't you?
no, i meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  a polite push, perhaps?  a clear shout of "watch out, anna" would have done nicely...
nice to meet you.
would i be the only one?  the only woman?
it goes very fast.
well daddy and i are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
i didn't know you were going with him.
she could be out.  she could be sick in bed for all we know.
why the fuck not?
how have you been feeling?
where is she?
you said the name "james."
student?
has anyone ever been to downey?
what are you talking about?
all right.
yes, i called him right away. he says it's nothing to worry about.
these are hard times, tom.
what?...
dmitri didn't want the money?
you tell me.
can't locate him.
how's it going?
i don't want you to get involved, really, i mean, i do, but if something went wrong i mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
don't tell me where to work. i moved to new york to work for edward dowd. but i can't believe that edward dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
no, i'm not.
it died for your sins.
no kiddin'?
that's not quite what i said --
i will, admiral.
send out a boarding party.  full assault gear.
i beg your pardon.
you know, buddy, sometimes i can't figure you out at all. you can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
she's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
thass right. just play it...
i'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
it's viridiana. she's getting on my nerves.
just browsing.  don't touch me....
peter's brother?  but --
how mr. kastle?
ah, no. i was.  it's hard to explain. she had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
i'd like to get paid before that eventually.  i don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
and thank you for getting me up here. i've never seen this before. beautiful, isn't it?
what the hell is it?
yeah. sure.
no.  from mr. stephens.  that was him on the phone just now.  he was calling to see how you were.
not even behind your back?
like what?
oh boy... in the club, or at home?
that's not true.  besides, i don't want you dusting.  i want you to see new york.
southglen south competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. we denominators don't even go to prom. -but to everyone else it's huge.
well, don't you?
thanks to you.
in hope of what? learning that it's true?! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
how many years did i live with your beams and boards?  first in the garage, then in the living room.  we're going to do it, robin.  next year.  next year.  salvaged floorboards from a house in pasadena. doors from a church in new hampshire...
no.
walt disney, who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  jesus christ plays shuffleboard.
sure, why not.
you'll get it when we get there.
where you get your bank statements.
it's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  we were completely unprepared.
he's dead.  whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
that's none of your bussiness. i have been a good worker, a good and loyal worker for you, you fucking asshole.
can't see a thing.  are you sure?
short fella. pale face.
jason bourne is dead.
you stay out of this, bob.
a job's come up and i thought about you. not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. walk me to my car, starling.
i still don't know what you're getting at. right now i want to take my nap. it's important that i-
does he always leave so early?
sure.
ok, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
i'm going, leon...  but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown, madame yakushova. is that what they're wearing in moscow this year?
joint action?
please, paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
let me go, bob!
i have to come back.  if i don't come back the people will think i'm a coward.  tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- i want his blood on the sand.  do you understand?
sure i do. and i'll tell you something else -- i'd like a baby.
empress, no! i will not take the money! i just came to tell you i was sorry...
you were busy? you know, i really was waiting for you to call me.
god i guess i'll have to introduce you now.
do we really need to repair this fort?  it seems like an expensive undertaking.  i propose we burn it to the ground.  that way if the germans cross the danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
you never get over it.
and i'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until i can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
i, uh...
this way...
jones...come with me.  cobb, you and doc check the rooms.
more than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
what about you, mare? how the hell'd you manage to stay single?
yes, sir.
it's blue. blue velvet.
because i was like you once. and there was no one there to help me.
just get outta my bed.
okay...
mr. reuben, i swear to god, they were out of line.
it's not like i'm miles away.
there's no mirror.
yes!
that's just the way we like it.
but how do you know?
i saw your mother on the strip last night.  she went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what i mean?
yes, basil?
i don't think so, jim...
eve. i'm fond of margo too. but i know margo. and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
jesus christ, stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  you have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is not the time to go to the bathroom.
i'm freakin out.  oh god i'm --
it's alright. i'll get it.
then tell him to wax it too.
koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
it'll come for the plane.  it's attracted to metal.  the electro- magnetic impulse....
nothing worse than a common tool.
my friend li mu bai.  he's given it to sir te as a gift.
listen, it's not erasing.
...i missed two-face by a heartbeat. when we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
i called you tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. do you remember where you were?
we're only going to be here a few hours...
like i just swam the english channel. now what?
the morning?
maybe the voice isn't diane selwyn. maybe that's your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are.
i am.
lead the way, murman.
hey, billy. watch the suit.

it's obvious, isn't it?
crunch...implosion.
susie, you're an assistant d.a., remember.  stick to what you can prove in court.
gigi, huh?  sounds french--one of those fancy ladies.  must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  i don't				* want dana and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. you promise?
stop it!
if you get caught using that --
who's dead?
so?
i'd rather mr. kane withdrew without having to get the story published. not that i care about him.  but i'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, mrs. kane.
impossible.
what?!
i don't know. all i can see is a lot of blowing sand!
but how can i do that?
you got one?
impact in fifteen seconds...
not you.  a copy.
there's our shaving stuff - and there's sugar.
but why? why would she do that? she's supposed to marry the guy!
explosive decompression.
i do not know.  away.
my kids?  let's see...susan's 15. aundrea's 9.  don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  how old are you?  never mind. let me just tell you this: every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  it's all true!  before i had kids when friends talked about their kids, i wanted to vomit.  now -- i get it.  am i right, leon?
oh, we didn't make much sense. drank too much. once he tried...
well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. how embarassing.
i don't want it on me.
don't start --
yeah.
serve.
and she wanted to talk.
no.
love! what the fuck do you know about love?
well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. when they flood the house. that like... destruction is a form of creation. so the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  they want to change things.
then say it.
you're still quite the boost, randall raines ...  except now i've been chopped, and my parts are in a honda prelude being driven to church in south america by some bolivian consulate's wife ...
what'd you say?
we didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
come on, don't be a pussy. everybody has to work.
you heard me.  you. congress and cabinet heads.
you're too young. you should be in school.
not when you have no choice.
what are you talkin' about?
yes, sir.
you didn't know anything about me.
what time are you gonna pick me up?
can i use the bathroom?
hell, yeah. i like it cold. colder the better.
when i'm not honing my craft in episodic television i do double-duty as a voice coach.  not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  not with that look.
couldn't be.
i don't think it's negative five.
you grow fond of him.  that's good.
i'll inform dispatch.
i'm sorry.  i haven't even got any cigarettes left!
you've been out for about a day.
g'bye, ms. sindell.
what are you talking about?
dr. gruber.
i suspect it will hurt a lot.
that's right.  i don't.
he looks like a fuckin' loser.
do you?
i mean, i am really attracted to you. jesus, you are a fag. we can share recipes, if you like, darlene.
sid, you don't have to.
you don't tell her majesty how you feel.
i didn't know either.
you want to know what it is?  what it's all about?  john.  chapter nine.  verse twenty-five.
they shall not hurt you
i padded your expense account for the last six months.
i'm cool.
hush, sweetheart.
you know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
that's what i said, it's so - it's too absurd!
oh thank god, you're dead...
yes, that is correct. i think you should ask mr. rand that.
the top of what?
this is a school... that's a student's work.  she'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
a wig?
where should i wash them?
now i can't be sure of how much of what he told you. so in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. that whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and i don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
i don't know what you're talking about. this is the most insane... the craziest thing i ever...
there's more than one kind?
i'm sorry she never got her miracle.
when you were so depressed after you shot mr. garrett jacob hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  and why shouldn't it feel good?! it must feel good to god. god does it all the time!
hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
you must leave this house.
when you're hot, you're hot.
how about these?
so you had a nightmare.
you make it up, but it has to be believable.  they call it suspension of disbelief.
mummy!
it's a beautiful thing.
that sounds like horseshit.
i can't hardly believe it. camp i was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
good. when you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. but you like him?
what do you mean?
do you drive a short beer bus or something? you go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. don't you see a pattern here, spuds makenzie?
good strategy.
shoot.
i don't know, garland; my place is here right now. i feel i'm on the brink of success-
i'm not sure i'd be good company tonight.
what medicine?
it's a secret.
road's in!  now, soon as we hit bixby we start making phone calls. we could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>people</u> magazine...
oh.
how did they get it away from him?
everything is not fine!
i don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  i mean whales may not have painted the mona lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
is there a problem?
the old crew. go find them. i can't help you with that. since i've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... a pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
there's nothing to be afraid of. everything's going to be alright.
i'm seeing what a busy man does.
no argument.
ah.  the director of "glen or glenda."
we sometimes went downtown to score.
okay, seriously.  what about napoleon, huh?
no.  with hair, yah.  but i must shave head for wrestlink.  it scare da crowds.  dey like that.
i do not.
thank you.
who was?
i don't know if you can choose that, rafe.
i'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
well, she...
yes.
i completely understand...
please not, 'the two kinds of people' speech.
what kind of trouble are you in?
just let me sit here for a moment? iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and santos killed her daddy?  does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
hey.  you feel like a cup of coffee?
you worthless piece of shit! gimme that!
the comedian . . . jon . . . now rorschach.
this week anyhow.
my first undercover assignment. i gotta look good, right?
who?
yeah. mom. mom and brother.
the piano.
where's emmett now?
but--
the big house?
calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  is your wife coming with you?
sure.
yes, i do. there's ruth barnes.
i'm afraid i can't stop to discuss this logically --
hold on, son...who's this colonel greenhill you're talking about?
we're a bit busy at the moment, i'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
that little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. x-ray vision, things of that sort.
i knew you'd like him.
yes.
what?
will you shut up?  you sound like my fucking sister.
i'm thinking about it.
you leave it.
so tracy?
i wasn't looking for a brawl.  i came to bring him a present.  wanna bite to eat?
you can't just pull the plug, david.
i don't have a choice.
what the hell happened over there? did he make a pass at you?
noooo....
well, a boy goes like this, see.
ahh..
that's the only reason, period. they only want one certain kind of black comic.
i got to know.  there is never any room for "personal"...
and did you witness the shoot-out?
though nicer than most?
can i ask how old you are?
what else should i become?  there's no difference between virginia and england.  i must be educated if i'm to take my place in society.  my father couldn't afford to send me to england for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  everyone laughs at me.
i guess i won't be showing it to him then.
i'll try to remember that, captain.
keep going. go around to the back.
the mystery's all gone. and i wanted you to find out who did it.
what about vice-president of the chamber of music, you used that title didn't you? but then i suppose you had no choice there either, because i suppose dr. goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, dear mr. vice-president.
those words were spoken by me.
you go in for dangerous things.
wrote the...?
nah.
what!
ah.
there's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
you're not going to drive!
who?
this is bandit ii. now, where the hell are you?
good. now if you'll just go along with mister washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
learn your cliches.  study them. know them.  they're your friends.
damn right.  and there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... that's the point, isn't it?  they wanna believe in the president.
so here we are. dead. but we never want you to want for anything. that is, we want you to have everything.
deep underground.  near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  you live long enough, you might even see it.
in this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
repairs ...
thank you, your honor. further: ms. costello is a rebuttal witness. as a 'surprise witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
no sir.
she did? i love her so much, and i haven't seen her in such a long time. and grandpa barney. is he all, right?
you're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? that's why they sent you here.
you fucking build it!  men come...
you might be right, but fun is overrated.  i need something real.
washed away.
i don't.
come on, linda. it's just sex.
that is what bothers me.
no lightspeed?
we've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, thelma.
no, look.  it's the others.  they're the ones causing these delays.
annie, what's the matter?
meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. if you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
milo. why would he --
you better hope the director doesn't stop abruptly one day, david, you might break your nose.
oh, god, was this like an rsvp thing?
whu --
we're the government, cowan.
am i?
i was too busy.
these? what are these? they're swords.
no, i want to go in.
you lost me.
we need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
that'sa lucille, you mullet head! any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named lucille.
if i'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
we know everything here. this is the storeroom of knowledge.
huh...?  sure i'm all right...
now.  yes...when?
i'm pregnant.
no particular reason. catch a laker game. i heard we got shaquille ...
they're coming around for another pass. you got extra weapons and ammo?
you get to know each other pretty well out there.

i'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
then why tell me?
... i think it would be best if you both left.
what?
you can kiss them if you want. feel them. they're getting hard.
you reached down into death.  now, isn't that right?
yeah i'm sure!  i did it with my own hands!
it's hard to say. doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. all it was was appendix.
no, he was wrong, david, i didn't find out.
ya catch any fish?
thank you.  no, i know you'd prefer "i'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
captain, i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
i doubt it. the water is only an inch deep.
edith, i'd like you to meet my son, harold. harold, this is edith... eh?
we'll *find* one! only throw compromise out of the window--stick to jeff smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. i don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
maybe she turned.
so i heard.  congratulations.  it's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
you worry about your end.  i got my side covered.
i figured you already heard.
about six months ago, i guess it is now. god, it seems like years. what a bore! i'm embarrassed by it. before this happened -- when i'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- i thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
oh, really?
let me see it.
yes, sir.
well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  and if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
you were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. you might have died.
i'm going with you.
i know what mommy says. i'm in charge today, though.
my mother's family is french, my father's was german, originally.
i think i might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
it's an uprising.
ohmygod.  didn't she say anything? she must've said something.
it hurts too much.
shut the door, emmi. sit down, emmi. we're going to keep him waiting, too.
i think it's about that time, letty. the charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
what?
daddy, she's younger than me.
won't?  or can't?
his wife.
okay. he loves us very very much. and i know that right now more than anything, your dad would want to know that we're safe. okay?
we can't leave without you!
oh, please. i'm not "pure of heart."
oh, we'll be back.  you can bet on it.
i'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
i was wrong.
whiskey.
so here we are!
what's left of him. he'll never see outside of the star and garter.
what's he doing here?
i was not.
yep. we're heading for the rendezvous right now. we get there, we pound booze till carlos shows up, he escorts us to el ray. and then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. how ya like them apples?
my dad is more interested in railroads. baltimore and ohio.  which is the port and which is the starboard?
oh yeah...
what would you know about a normal frame of mind?
oh yeah...
yes, but no, i can't right now.
could you call me back on your phone? right away.
you're a reed, man.  i gotta get anna.  hang in there...
i know.  what can i do?  he is the boss.
oh, did i hurt the little girl's feelings? well excusez moi... i confess my desire for adm is quite "intense". so i deceived you and our poor friend terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "the great cure for lycanthropy!" hmph. he didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of adam, until it was too late. and even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if i would be just as shocked! ha.
you think i care about her?  i'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
i know what i see.  i see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  who's not afraid.  i see a women who thinks... "what if?"...
well, i guess they got it comin'...  but you wouldn't go if claudia was alive.
what are you doing? what are thev doino? ~7c int. sarris' ship	h37c
people are pretty cagey.  who do you know?
sort of.
okay, okay, we won't go.  it's not like i have a dress anyway
you're mushing it a little around the--
just dull.
no.
you should've done what i did. a clean break.
stephen's not staying here now, brian. he moved out last april.
oh! my god! 
you've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, diz?
i don't know what happened!  i don't know who he is!  i don't know what he wants!  i don't even know who i am!  the only thing i know is that if i stay here, i'm never gonna find out!
my name is sir launcelot.
let's go talk to bill...
yeah. i haven't seen him in a while. he used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... good boy. hal. lives in new york near his mom.
we'll get you together!
i thought we'd lost you.
i'd use pills. they're painless.
you don't think my sister catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
it was just an idea.
sleep.  it'll be light soon.
...and i'd be lying to you if i didn't tell you, i'm about out of moves, dick...
it looks so...<u>new</u>.
nothing. two nights later i was robbed. i'm pretty sure they were pros.
no, ho-jon, we're not going to open you up.
then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
nah, i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... gimmee the nuke.
close every door behind you!
so push it!
sun is bad for yuh. everything our parents said was good is bad. sun, milk, red meat, college...
he ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
why?  then they'll notice when i'm gone.  well.  i'm making a public appearance aren't i?
well, how about it?
when she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
mr. cole... not only am i a teacher... but i am also a parent of a middlesex child. therefore, i am the only person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
we think there are other cities surviving. we think maybe detroit... there's some signalling out of philly.
she was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. oh boy did she love to laugh. sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
a bit too quick.
i don't know it was stolen until i got here.
and after that?
she knows not to steal.  i've taught her better than that.
i'm fine.
we don't know for sure...
no, jeff--please--!
atten-hut!
what do you want?
she's got an army of people to get her up and out.
he told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question norman bates' mother, right?
that's funny. i need to talk to you, too.  perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, professor tripp.
you know, i've got to do some shopping afterwards. do you want to go?
yes.
there.
i've been on ice like this when i was a kid, skating.  spread your weight, keep moving.  go on.
of course.
i thought they opened at seven.  if i left my car would it be ok?
3:30 i guess.
fortunately, not.  this is my first experience with it as a physician. but i have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call zombies.  i am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
i don't know. got it from stephanie.
gotcha.
right. claims assessor.
no.
yeah, i think you sounded pretty good.
what's that, lilly?
uh huh..and i don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
bodybuilding!
a-negative. i've cross-matched it.
i never left. where's my wife and daughter?
come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
oh, my love  you ran from me before.
that was a long time ago.
i'm fine.
what are you going to do about sport and that old bastard?
a small house.
nobody said... norman...  what?  why are you looking at me like that?
hi. it's nathan.
once i get in the water but not starting off. by the time i catch up, it's too late.
behave!
radiation level...constantly rising...
i'm tired, judy.  i'd like to change the subject.
i don't know why i'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
what kind of lead?
i love the outfits.
but alas poor romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter tybalt?
we oughta get a couple of those rockets.  voom!  we're there before we left!
oh, praise the lord.  relax everybody.  everything is under control.  the jug head's going to think of something.
sorry, i don't remember.
they're at college.  or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
what do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
uh huh.
what do you want to do?
bastard bit my chopper.
maybe you just need to give her some time. she's so nice, brad. everybody loves lisa.
we both know what you were doing.
fine.
what about the engagement party?
well, we never made it official, so i guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but i was seeing him in school. i saw him at the mall about six months ago and i was too nervous to introduce myself so i followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. it was registered to his mother, so i went to her house. she was so nice. i mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz i never really spoke to her. i just waited til she went to work then i climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. i say borrowed because i'm going to give it back one day. but anyway, i called everyone in it til i found her son. he wasn't home when i called so i left this message how much in love i was with him. i was, and how i wanted to have his children. just really opening up, and he never called back. i'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later i just decided i deserved better. what about you? do you have a boyfriend?
too late for apologies, walker.
yes?
don't even tell me you're hot for miss titty pom poms over there.
that's all i can say.
you are guilty. i'm guilty.
yeah, it was violet's idea.  i was so wound up about gino, she was trying to help me relax.
must've...anyway, i ain't goin' back to look for it...
hi, david.
hey, wait a minute!
yes, sir!
forget ricky. you should be glad max got you driving for me.
this really isn't a good time.
no, i didn't.
so's woody allen.  no, your uncle really helped me. i was sort of messed up for a while. wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. he kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  you know, he and claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. totally dedicated.
right there.
i'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
yes.
you haven't told me everything.
you told me so.  maybe you'd get some sympathy.  you came to the wrong place.
maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
a rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! where i come from --out in montana--we have some pretty women, but i guess if you walked down main street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
if you're serious. being serious is real important.
oh, god...
that's what it is. walk on out.
no, they don't. not the smart ones.  look, i'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... but when you fall off this horse, come see me. i can show you how to make a lot of money.
i know what a vig is.
well, thank you very much. you can go now.
orson, please ... it's too bright
who is she?
we haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. they're calling this whole area the briar patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. just get me data's schematics. i'll keep you informed.  dougherty out.
'it's booty time, it's booty time, across the u.s.a.  it's booty time...'
yes, you could. cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. marry me.
oh come on, kathryn, it was just a contest.
i betrayed a man.  a good man.  an innocent man.  a thief.
no.  you're quite wrong.  right here's the seat of the trouble. mrs. holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  it's revived all their old superstitions -- zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
that would definitely explain it.
i want to be john malkovich. tomorrow morning. plus i'd like to meet this partner of yours.
that's right. you're going to rio. rio de janeiro. on your own. come on, you should know. you bought the fucking ticket.
it's nice isn't it?
there's no disease, i can tell you.
and you're taking?
y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
i have to talk. is that okay?
you're upset about me -- i made you fight --i hate for you to fight.
please - no names.  just call me junior.
hi. did you have a nice swim?
stay away from me, jez.
well, i know that i lost my job because of one meeting i went to when i was a kid in college.  i know that i've been branded a communist, which i'm not, but even if i was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a bill of rights for?
but what if...
we've got to get out of here...now.
that's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
you'll get used to it.  i'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
why do i always have to do it?
maybe you should.
absolutely.
why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  they were wedged in tight.  they couldn't get a grip on them.  they would have had much more strength pushing on them.
how did it happen?  what was iris doing riding around with jeriko wearing a wire?
you are, lewis.  you rolling?
i know you both. enough. how much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
you like the wild ones, don't you? tillman, nicolet and now foley.  you know, i've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
that is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied france.
i believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- i believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- i believe your husband is one of those individuals.
i thought you had her!
i failed to resolve the situation.
my horse doesn't work.
to keep the daylight out! this is where they sleep! get to the door!
a lot of people. teachers. younger kids. it's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  but that's ok... because i know i deserve it.
you totaled it, huh?
why did you do that?
you're sweet. i really wish someone had thrown a party like that when i was your age. my life might have been very different.
i thought you already left.
it's crazy, but i don't really know, i mean i haven't written anything but "misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. maybe you can come up with a title.
yes.
what's going on in berlin?
you are upset.
hmm.  well, we were in a handicapped spot.  it, uh, it was probably towed.
something's wrong with this whole setup --
rosebud?
fan works.
you do?
she ran off to mexico. rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. went there to get rid of it.
i really liked you too, talby. hey, some debris from the ship! it's coming right by me.
burma!
ah, forget it, kid. i want you to pull this out of your head. if that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, i will. i respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
alvy, i can't say that that's true at this point in my life. i really just can't say that that's true. i mean, you know how wonderful you are. i mean, you know... you're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. anyway, look, i don't wanna- listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
the door was locked from your side.
you think this is so easy?
walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on shammas--
really?
and i saw that i was alone.
uh huh.
i don't know.  haven't seen anybody.
why point it at me?  i'm the real thing.
hello, luv.
oh, jesus. you're such a fuckin' retard!
let's try this way!  holy maker.
it's my jamie's birthday today. your godson.  he's nine years old. at his party he asked me if uncle alex was coming.  i told him no. then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
that sudden?
fine. actually, today was a good day. you should have seen her.
yeah i'll look into that tonight.
were you or were you not working in the watchdog office over the weekend?
see she doesn't drink too much.
that's good... that's wonderful. it's wonderful for you.
i'm not sure that's possible.
that's not so good for you, my friend.
i have to talk to you in a second about that, lance, ok?
inflation, tuition, college. children are damned expensive. i know.
yep.
more, i hope.
i guess mr. kane didn't think so well of susie's art anyway.
a gun's a gun man. it don't need to be loaded.
purple haze, pink eraser.
'laura scudder's peanut butter'.  you like it?
okay, miss starling?
any idea where i could find buddy?  or glenn?
they always are.
neither do i.
what <u>are</u> you interested in? 
hello.
that's right.
pity. mr. gibbs.
i wanna close up soon.  c'mon, let's call her.
how old?
your nephew doesn't want a drink.
nothing.
i don't. look, stay out of what you don't understand.
i don't know. the cheeks maybe... look a little --
recognizers!
funny, i thought it was a strong point.
damn.  'and wainwright...'
aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
not quiet yet.
people have made mistakes in these situations before.
did you know him?
sam, give dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
no. it's all right. i'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
you flew all the way h...
well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
dave, may i ask why the urge to go ice skating in texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
this thing just went up a degree.  ice cream's not workin'.
yeah.
i'll see what i can do.
yes, sir. rubinstein takes out a notebook.
joseph returns from the room where gisèle is. he has evidently succeeded in calming her. he goes and sits in the chair where nikolas sat. he rests his head in his hand. he sees the open diary and begins reading it.
so we kill him?
i didn't steal the truck! he owed it to me!  anyway, the important thing is i'm not goin' through missoula!
go inside. i'll be right there.

certainly not!
yeah. i service video equipment.
what about?
you?  don't make me laugh.  you can't take care of shit.  you've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  all you're good for is games... so far, what i got outta you is nothin'...
should i?
this one could save your life.
times up!
i... just knew. a husband knows.
you're no good
...doris--
i...
i know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
good luck then.
please.  i need to know.
if those corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  all we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  how's that sound to you, skipper?
shut up.
get it in the stacks at the library of congress, now.  who's seeing the guy at c.b.s.?
hey , hey !
he walked right up to me in church. at the holiest time of the wear. he approached me in a sanctified place.  kill him now.
i'll wait.
save it.
ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, raziel?
it's coming... argh! i can't!
and you'll never leave me?
tom ripley. thank you, sir.
you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "clay bertrand" and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswald's layer.
not very well, i'm sure.  i'd probably start doping myself.  or maybe i'd...
o.k.
you pawned it.
no problem with me on the job.
you been with a girl ever?
well, for starters, what do you do? where're ya from? what's your favorite color? who's your favorite movie star? what kinda music do you like? what are your turn-ons and turn-offs? do you have a fella? what's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? and, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
a guy dressed as santa has been exposing himself to kids in los feliz.  apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
except this victim got away. i wonder if --
it is time to clarify the situation. everything is over between us.
hello, i'd like to speak to lydia?
how like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
maybe she used another name.
yeah, asshole.  i'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
better late than never. korean war hero, sheriff for near thirty years-- buddy deeds memorial p--
well i, i don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
i have excellent long-term memory.
bollocks. you know what you can do with that watch? you can stick it up your arse. slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
hey...!
really? where the hell do you keep it? it's huge.
thanks, man. sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
and then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
no.  that was a sword in a field.
dammit!!!! dammit!!!!
that is for me to decide.  i need to talk to her mr. riley, she is a key element in this case.  i have a press conference in an hour, and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
we can't.
he looks familiar.
you're insane or you think i am.
i don't care about that. i just ain't going back. you don't want me? okay. i'll find me another place.
don't say words unless you mean them, misty. 
not much, i think.
not lately you can't...
somebody shut his lights. i guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
you'll end up like me.
mr. van dorn, i've worked on the color scheme for weeks. i think it's just right.
no, sir.
you're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
no, no, no, no, no. uh, hey, man. you know i'm really sorry if i, if i said something wrong. i, i...
i did?
do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
i said.  get the gun.  out.  of my fucking <u>face.</u> before i wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
i'm sorry, louise.  i know you're all upset.  it's just i'm so excited to be out of the house, i guess.  i wonder if darryl's home yet.
i was in the psychiatric wing. it bothers you, finding out i was in there... doesn't it?
lula, he mighta did, i don't know. but it don't matter now. lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
he doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
his father's the manager, sir. the kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
you gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
jeb stuart, stonewall jackson, jefferson davis -- they're all losers in my book.
i'm sorry.  is this a problem?
shhh.
'doctor' neilsen?  when did <u>that</u> happen?
chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. if you will be patient, maybe i will pay you something another time.
what's going on?
the technology is brand new. soon it will be more powerful. we anticipate a huge demand. leave us your number. we'll be in touch.
when nando died--it was so sudden--i was kind of in shock for awhile. then i woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and i didn't have any idea what to do with it.
i suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
it's very becoming to you, mr. selectman.
damn it!  why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
oh, no. nothing's wrong. everything's fine!  so there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the john does, eh?  you forgot one detail, mr. big shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the john doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
time for a champion.  can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, jack?
doll, you and waski run on, too.
why would you suppose so?
are you threatening me with legal action, mr. fabian?
whatever i'd say, you'd carry on. victor, why don't you tell me about rick? what did you find out?
you got it.
yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
well, joe, you're a nice guy, and i'd be doing you both a favor, but why? what'm i dragging my bum leg all over town for? it's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
i think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
oh yeah. moonan. i remember now. thanks.
what'll happen. i mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, christ!
you're scaring me. i think we should just go.
alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here? yet tell me not, for i have heard it all. here's much to do with hate, but more with love. why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate! o any thing, of nothing first create! o heavy lightness! serious vanity! misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! feather of lead-- [benvolio snickers] dost thou not laugh?
i spent all day crawling out of a grave. the costumer kept bitching 'cause i was ripping my nylons –-
to who?
you find this amusing, do you?
i wanna go home.
it's not about being fun.  it's about being smart.  you take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. ever.  that's freedom.  that's what i'm talking about.
use the gifts that allah has given you.
i promise nothing'll happen if you do.  you want my jacket?  it's warm.
i no understand you. maybe crazy.
all right.
jordan.  might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  i do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
jack, stop that. i'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
crabs?
pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  just watch 'em.
you know who it was and you know you aren't, and i mean are not gonna see him ever... end of story.
i'm the next one.
i'm doing it.
no idea.
nick the greek.
is this a--what day is this?
i'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
you keep saying that.
it takes money to buy food.
he's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
who?
he's not even aware of it. when you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. that's why everybody loves him. other times...
oh sure ... you bet.  betty ...
-- we are?
we haven't ruled out that possibil...
you're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
pshhh...
someone stop her!
what did he say?
hey!
it?  who does?
what? the end of the world? man, don't give me your mad rap. i'm not a bartender. i don't want to hear it. i raise a family doing this bullshit. do me a favor. get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
i don't care.
well you should all go to bed early. i'll do the cleaning up.
come again?
yes, i'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him.
who's he play for?
i hope so
that's doable.
who's doing this?
it's a school night... back by nine.
used to.
what piece? richard crookback?
with all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
why me?
you're right, you know. we don't have much time.
really. just put it there, harold.
because i don't want cancer.
well, i don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, ben. i do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon.
no, i'm not, i'm not worried. i'm not worried.
what?
oh, god...oh, god...  jim, excuse me...ray, i told you, who he is is the senior vice- president american express.  his family owns 32 per...over the past years i've sold him...i can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  i promised five weeks ago that i'd go to the wife's birthday party in kenilworth tonight.  i have to go.  you understand. they treat me like a member of the family, so i have to go. 
here is why this fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. shadout is chakobsa... knife, in chakobsa is... maker of death.  it's a maker...
i can't help it.
mom, he just fixed our car.
we're a team...my...talent. your... mobility.
grab hold!...
put your arms around my neck. lock your legs around my waist.
yeah. i did it.
ouch. i hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
two bits.
it's a little late.
what was in the 'miami herald' and the 'times.'  confessions?
i just don't think you're being fair.
happy now?
be quiet, chick--i'm trying to think--  this deficiency bill is going to be read in the senate tomorrow.
because i lost a filling in my back tooth. i gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
when mother died pop sent me out to school in the country. he was afraid with no one home i'd— get into bad company.
i dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
oh, come on, we've seen it. i'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on nazis.
listen... nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, i explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
i don't think she can sing, either.
and a car.
you and mel gordon?
put a tap on her phone.
but things change.  you gotta think ahead.
i like calling you david.
it was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
i know that. i know what's at stake here...
i did another one last night.  you might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
i'm sorry...
sure, boss.  sure you can.
yes.
no way can he get away with this. i'll be back by tonight.
sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
oh my g-d.  we were having lunch here. he started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor - and i walked out on him.  i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
four goddam months. and they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
hal, unless you follow my instructions, i shall be forced to disconnect you.
to be what?
how?
he's a man of god; he's true to his vows.
you know, blonde, thin, whatever...
look 'em up and and out what they mean.
yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. you're the ones with the studebaker, aren't you?
i don't know. i've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? unless you're tired of talking about it.
anything else?
where could he have gone?
you will know, in good time.
nothing is... anymore.
goodbye.
keep warm, dear. let me hear from you.
stensland and meeks.  what were they up to?
who do you think you are?
a vampire-king?  you mean like dracula?
too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  she was a professional. used to work in the dutch schultz gang.
pretty sure or sure sure?
what did he say to you in french?
mm.
and hair.  black and curly, like a doll.  and such a mouth.
yo, check it.  this is good and all that but one day soon i want to have much benjamins so i can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. you hear me.
better get him to a hospital.
scams, con games.  how many?
so, did you see "seinfeld" last week? that kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
unhappily, it is true, sire.
...and then i'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who i'm not even really attracted to...
he likes to read...  did he mention anyone in particular?
no.
how would you've done it?
shhhh! this is the national anthem.
you'd think he'd had practice.
no shooting.
serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. the killer has yet to strike twice.
1000 meters...
yeah! well, i do the firing, too. remember that, duffy, and keep a civil tongue in your head.
wait.  i have to write this down.
i know it's not the greatest.  it's commercial.
sorry.
then we're all in a lot of trouble.
otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
freylag's stronghold?
soon as i rest a bit.  i meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
say, you got a lulu.
the only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. so you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  good luck.
you amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  you're the reason the convict died. you're the reason i got fired!
that would be too easy.
c'mon.  you intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  she sees me differently.
quite a week.
i'm sorry...i just mentioned it in passing.  i never thought he'd use it.
why?
jesus christ, no. okay, okay. you got it, you got it! you're the boss.
since when do you care about the homeless?
home.
no. no word.
when do you have to be here?
it's just linda. and mark from school.
sweet dick, i didn't mean it like that.
stop calling me max.
i don't know the details of the treaty, sire, marshal mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that i was to take the army and make for fontainebleau.
but, your majesty, the very substance of the tilsit treaty was that you should join the continental blockade, boycott english goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be france's ally.  nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
you sure you're not thinking of him right now?
first, i have fun.
nothing.  she wanted to know about suck night.
claiming their place in the world.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
uhura, monitor!
audrey, listen, i need help. i know it's late and i shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me i wouldn't have if i could see any other alternative, but i – i'm sorry - listen, how are you – i'm sorry. you doing okay?
tyler...
you're an attractive man.
i don't have a credit card.  they took my wallet.
listen...
no -- she asked me about cocaine.
my son, i foresaw this. i knew -
well, i've talked to bill mayhew-
mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
who?
what's wrong with you today?
mr. president, there is another possibility we haven't considered. this may not be a coup at all.
you are.
the mountains are solid granite. we'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to bixby if we have to.
fuck you.  just give me back a little something for the road.
what do you mean?
come with us, daddy. please come with us!
yes, sir... but, do you have these?
i am for you.
forget it.  i'm sick of working for that dickhead.
you see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  i'm so embarrassed i could die!
first of all, we're going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens. we'll watch her for awhile. i'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
i'm just building up to it, dad.
you seem pleased by the prospect.
last year was awful rough--mama passing on and the whole business with o.j.--i mean it's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
of course.
instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, i'm gonna make up my mind that i fall into a magic world where i can get something special, like a poem or song.  they get all their art literature from dreams. just wake up and write it down. dream skills.
where are his pants?
yeah.
ben -- how old are you now?
what're those?
yes! that never occurred to me.  her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  gus, my friend, you're a genius. okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
haven't you had enough? don't think and drive.
so you got a girl?
goodnight, rocky.
now, i know that i shall die if you leave me.
i know, i liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! she gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's little miss perfect and everybody loves her.
clean. real clean.  as clean as my conscience.
yes?
chicken.  this is a great short cut.
meet me at three.
that's what you think.  they've promised to back me, trinity. they're going to reinsert my body. i'll go back to sleep and when i wake up, i'll be fat and rich and i won't remember a goddamn thing. it's the american dream.
it's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. i am going to call him.
it's no biggie.
shhh!
the pages filled in?
get me a couple juicy pictures. somethin' i can wise the rabbit up with.
what if i went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
but -- why?
bud brought it to me.
good winds and bad winds!
-- and you told me that. still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, i think, getting in your way --
is this what you want -- huh?  is it?
this is it?  i told you on the phone, i have to be moved in in two weeks.  sarah, please don't bounce that here.
-- small.
i'm sure.
life.
home after.  will you come in and say "hi"?
she had this in her mouth. there, there...
i don't know what he thinks...i don't know what i think...i don't even know why i'm talking about it...  it's silly...i'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
nothing.
oh, right... 's fine. thanks.
i'll risk it.
all right.
it might have.
you gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
what for?
what are you saying?
you're all hear.
have a drink?
i need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
you have run out of time.  the amount now is two hundred million.  i will call later with instructions.  you will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
i'm in.
exactly.  and the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. i knew i wanted to propose, so i took her there.
you must.  luke, look at me!
jean and scotty never have to worry.
right.
you just can't stop editing me. huh?
get the fuck out of here, jack.
you always live there?
i was looking for you.
then what will you say?
then your father's a wimp.
to be sure, captain.
well?
give up, dennis.  let these people go. at least you'll have your life.
yorgi and kirill.
go ahead.
don quixote.
you said ... one shot.
'cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
on my way to denver...
boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "i am the law and i am the danish..."
i did no such thing!
i don't know.  maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, i sure as hell can't find it.
funny, jack.  i’m laughing on the inside.
i don't understand. is there any point to it?
too right it is. now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos i'm fucking lee marvin, by the way.
cathay?
are you ready?
i didn't stutter.  you heard me.
i know.  and now?
don't you care about what's happened?
no--
on television!!  cut the shit, will you!
you want information adjustments. different department.
i sure hope you haven't done anything dumb jackie.
upstairs. he's quite docile.
you can't be herr mozart!
yeah ... you don't have rain either?
really.  i don't know.
government weather. it's got a transmitter aboard.
hmmmmmmmmm?
yeah, sure, i guess.
thank you.
can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
with all respect, padrino.  diego is my partner.  i do not do business without him.
ah, that's the new german 77. and judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
shee-it, man, i can't say all that.
that's it? -- completely?
i've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. it was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
because last time i saw him i punched him in the face.
will you be in atlanta for a while? i'm not buggin' you about coming home, i just wondered.
alice. just ring linen service and ask for alice.
did you look in here?
ah. i believe you also consumed romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, doctor?
drugs can help suppress symptoms. but lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  and, michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. he's been in and out of...
no.
no, nothing.  there's only some talk.
just like that it's all over? with less than two weeks to go, you're out?
sorry, mom!
inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  all parts intact.
no. no.
i can't let him down.
what?
looks like a two thousand pound to me. yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
yesterday.  i gave her a thousand dollars.
you're still afraid.
i don't know. how much do you want?
where have you been staying?
look in the hamper. linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
i don't know. my mind wanders.
he's an illusionist.  it's not exactly brain surgery.
yeah, i just got back.
and who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon england's policies in her own colonies? to come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
right.  now look: i want you all to be very careful. this is terra incognita. many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. it's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
i can handle it.
yes.
yeah, well ... she lives with district court judge seymour croft ...
-- forget it.  and try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  why do this?
fifteen news items.  i got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  they're all old pros.
pommeroy.
got it, teach.
crash override.
we'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
this time we'll make an exception.
sandy, contact traffic control.
sophia. hello sophia. mine's still john.
as if i didn't know.
it's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
yeah, but don't tell anybody.
and so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the phantom zone. in it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
don't say anymore. the reels are still turning. i have but one chance to show you the meaning of what i've said.
well, it ain't that good up there neither. might as well make it here. 'course i ain't really makin' it now.
okay.
terrific. now all i have to do is find my car keys.
nope, but --
lucien baines?
it's about miss kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
two minutes, 35 seconds.  damnit, i'm involved in this thing, so i just wanna know what this thing is. i wanna be treated as an adult.
and once i'm a woman, jean-claude and i are getting married --
give them a little while longer. it's still early, anyway.
just shut up?
shut up! don't make up any stories!
there's nobody here, father. look for yourself.
these are for you.  from father to son.
no.  go ahead.  really.  ladies first.
there are two things i will not put up with during working hours.  one is liquor - and the other one is men.
i mean it. the car is yours. dump debbie.
it bit me! my leg! jesus, it's down there, shoot it! shoot it for christ's sakes!
ahmar is ossirion. "passageway to the underworld", actually.
the mary is in deference to the holy mother, the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola.  there are three vows that every nun must accept.  the vow of poverty...
but the sword could be in his compound.
it isn't... ?
you should have told me.
why do you interfere with my little romances?
no, none for me. come on, let's play.
<u>kill</u> you!  he's coming to kill you!
egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  do you remember that?
you don't?
yes.
now, wait a second --
but kirk...
then let me give you something then...
i got overhead...
i have scruples. next.
not lately.
easy.  tell me about the ruckus.
kansas?
i do.
she lives in rome, but she does stuff here the smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
i got to agree with that.
what'd he die of?
until last night. did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party?
they'll trace it.
not anymore.
... yeah.
thx and me.
now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the internet, i can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
don't be.  i'm going.  where we all go.  now how can that be bad.
but if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
aw, mom! i hate mr. stubbins!
it has everything.
curse and stuff.
what does that mean?
misunderstood what!?
ssh!
yeah.  she's leaving with tran so i got to boogie.  real quick... iris checked into the sheraton last night under a false name.  paid cash.
okay.
noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the u.s.  government.  so, no, i don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
where would we find him?
liza?
'good.'
i haven't given you much of a life.
hello, sonny.
has this ever happened before?
she'll say, "now my son is a man."
look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
he lost a shoe!
oh come on. for her first time?
well, i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, mrs spitz. i wouldn’t like to think i’d kept you waiting for nothing.
this is a first. you criticized the deputy director to his face and you still have a badge? you must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  why don't you just quit? i mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
terrific.
my arm!  he took my fucking arm!
yeah.  i'll do that.  as long as you're not patronizing me.
we think we got a rat in the house.
yes, jennifer told me. what does that have to do with me?
you're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
i've been looking for this jake vig for some time now. problem is, the guy's the invisible man. a spook, a spectre, a ghost. then, like a gift, jake's good buddy and member of his crew, alfonse moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
tapert's got nothing to do with this.  he came here to get his palm read.
such as.
i don't know.  i'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
what about dr. becker and mr. gries?
relax. it's okay. take a deep breath.
the spiders.
i thought you said all the panthers were gonna be here.
who is "danny terrio?"
as soon as you get dressed.
how came you by this blade?
yes --
well, i'm afraid it's not that easy...
my clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
there won't be ... there won't be ... what else do you need?  how else can we help you?
it sure would have made attractive headlines: great star kills her- self for unknown writer.
let me guess, you're the goy who stole hanukkah.
but we went there.  we saw those kids.
are you all right, dorothy?
i know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- paris is ours...!
jack, jack, it's dwarves live here. hard-working chaps.  hammering in the forge all the live-long day. make the most wondrous things, they do.
who's she?
curtis.
yes?
the milkmaid's daughter?
stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
you're home.
you love her that much?
it was bad, wasn't it.
what kind of nuts?
out-of-town.  that's all he'll say.
sure.
didn't want you.
must be the pressure.
hasn't moved for twelve hours. go on. have a heart.
if you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  believe me, you get used to it.
what about tomorrow?
the one you bought at school.
i'm retired.
but i don't have it.
yes, clarence. a man down on earth needs our help.
a piece of shrapnel hit me.
okay.
who, sally?
sure you are, sport.
yeah..
see, my problem is, all i have are hundred dollar bills and i need something smaller.  ones, fives, tens. like that.
then don't.
she doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
they can bill me.  i got a tab running.  what's second?
you can't run with suitcases.
well shut it off at once!
get outside, go back to work. i'll join you shortly.
according to the newspaper, fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus. are you familiar with the hanta virus, agent mulder?
it's not nice to be evasive.
oh, i like it. i like it very much.
how long would their shields be down?
i forgave you the moment you said it.
what're you - a mindreader...?  who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
a little, i think... darlin'?
it ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  take the damn gun.
yeah, chili. hi.  you're fifty feet in the air!
it wasn't smart. even if you'd gotten away without me --i'd have found you--no matter where you were.
yes.  well, i'm coming over to your house to get some things.
zack, i don't know if i want to do that...
i can't describe it. i think it's from the loam in the soil. this very rich, earthy kind of... alive... no. no, that's not right. can you smell it?
you don't know all that has happened here- the devil has come to tsavo.
sheila'll be at "tops".
oh?
they're liars and cowards.
what is it?
thanks for the presents.
wretched.  what happened to me?
up there!!
when are you going back?
listen to yourself, frances. the resistance, the anger in your voice.
are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
like you really care.  like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
what's a little hate between business partners?
uh-huh.
jesus christ. mr. gordon, when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons, i don't call ahead for an appointment.
to arm-twisting.
of course you took the initiative.
it will only make you self-conscious.  you'll have to remove your shirt.
yes, it's-it's wonderful.
reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. just follow the line.
i say -- it don't matter.
yeah.
that true, fergus? you in love?
you're too quick for me.
i thought he was out of town.
you golf?
you could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
what, nervous i'm going to win?
want to take a poke at him?
honey, what happened?
jack.
to castle couer de noir?
you're not one of those guys from the military, are you? trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
los angeles.
it's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
a jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
uh huh?
i'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  you could say or you can quote me, i'm a glass half full king of guy.
you will not tell. as you love me and as i love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
do you have the suspect in custody?
the one with da big...
unless she has nerve.
i don't go at all.
what's the matter?
i was trying to protect you from this...
let me get this straight.  you're like, this greasy bum, and i have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause i'm chosen, and there's vampires.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
let me get my bag.
bud.
your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... all this time, i've never had the courage to touch it.
oh my god. i can't tell you how nervous i've been. i couldn't sleep last night.
yes, indeedy.
i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things.
i think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
yah, linda's fine. you should call her.
i did not, grandma.
i'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  you're still in command.  clayton forrester!  i haven't seen you since oak ridge.
thank you, david ... and a very merry christmas to you all.
i read about them in time magazine.  when these revolutionary brothers and sisters are free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the los angeles international airport where you will be given further instructions.  you have two hours to comply.
see ya and raise three.

now <i>you're</i> here.  who are your "friends"?
you're the monster! you're the freak! get out! you're finished!
nothing, jake.  absolutely nothing.
hot?  i'm freezing my ass off.
she's in the hospital.
yes. i did.
don't be sorry. you're right to be suspicious. i shagged her. i shagged her rotten.
oh, i couldn't eat nothing. my mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
i'd like that.
then you won't forgive me?
well then the people you need to call are the police.
not really. if he finds it, i say mr. walker put the money in, and i didn't know nothing about it. like the coke.
what? what did you tell me?
if you find her...
oh! i'm sorry...
mother . . .
you said it!  here's looking at you, kid.
it'll cost you five bucks.
what do you mean?
you don't have to.
who?
i'm alexander p. lovett, sir.
this is where we are.
yeah?...
fine.
yes. i liked louise very much. she was his maid.
a man named tim ma-...
the eat a peach album. god, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. listen to this, louis.
then just wait.  i'm counting this all out and deducting my share. while i'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  and her little girl.
uncle terrence, you're...
oh. you like her?
there was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
i just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
i busted their window, they didn't do anything.
no, i happened to see you come in, and i thought --
forget it. they got stringent hyg- iene rules. he's long gone in lime.
just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
father's back?  still angry?
jimmy, come on. fuck 'em. don't give them the satisfaction.
transient or resident?
think about your father. your sister.
i'm sorry --
don't get too far!
jews. she's talking about jews.
i told you! i won't apologize for who i am.
no.
right, the one simone gives me. simone and i'll make the switch at robinson's/may. she knows what i look like?
my gun?
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate...
yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. i've made a lot of sacrifices for you, juno. and in a couple years you're going to move out -- and i'm getting weimaraners.
it's not just your livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of all blacksmiths.
i was going to tell him ... but in my own time. in my own time... .
ricky. i'm trying to save this money. understand? i'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
i don't have to.  you'll be bustin' in on the chief of police just up the hall. 
absolutely.
it's a party.
you assumed wrong.
i know, i'm sorry.
i got lured.
doolittle... i think it's the phoenix asteroids!
oh, she does, huh? isn't that sweet of her! you don't , i suppose.
i don't even want you to go. whaddya think of that? i got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's god's gift to women. one twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in new york city. it's laughable.
i'm making you a steak.
you aren't angry with me?
when you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
oh, sorry i spoke.
uh, yes, you do.
come on...
well, you're a tower of support.
lemme talk to him.  will?  shoe?
maybe he wants something.
i'll be back.
yes, sir. but captain... are we... all going back?
naw! not a major.
we can explain, colonel.
who was that other guy?
where'd you go to school, kid.  wellesly?
i didn't say i was scared.
well, that's our life now, isn't it?
i have money to buy more, but i haven't had a chance since...
i'm not a lawman, i'm just a private citizen getting' my property back
from tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! is master shakespeare not handsome?
they're from my old convent.
we'd like to ask you some questions about daniel zavitz.
put the gun down, please, boy.
you must be out of your mind. i've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
just keep kicking.
i know you've only known me a short while.
damn.
we'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
as the sun slowly sets in the west, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
don't look.
but you have a right to let us know what you think.
... thanks.
no, it's the whole idea behind it. how did they get this place?
and almost got tossed out of the academy...
no.
did you?
we're dead!  they showed this prison movie to my youth group on sunday.
meet cereal killer. as in froot loops? but he does know things.
is that right? well, listen to this: drag your ass. this is a restricted area.
what's the deal? did anybody make a decision -
so am i, eve.
well, i'm glad you got it out of your system. congratulations. mission accomplished.
nobody's gonna kill you.
i'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
so i hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
even though he knew about you?
that is none of our business.  but you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
you mean, am i gonna help you kill them cowboys?
after you, doll.
yes, a little dizziness, and i think, i think i'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  no, i'm sorry.  it was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
i ain't killed nobody.  shall i rack 'em?  play a game, lupe?
rae...
they tried to electrocute me, frank.
no, i can't leave you. i won't. not yet. not until i've made you laugh... at least once.
not so fast. he barely knows him --
yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
you too?
mind if we skip that?  i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys.
what'd you want me to do? back down? he called me a bitch. we kept our rep.
i can't! i'm tied!
make a thousand of 'em. still won't be enough by the time i'm through.
have you heard?  the british are negotiating to make a trade for general lee.
oh, i'm sorry. i forgot you were here. no, mr. williams, we still have some questions for you. sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
his dead body with a bullet in it.
yeah, yeah, yeah.  you remember?
my wife. where were we?
i saw everything.
every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  baron, you know -- i've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
not at all.  but on the other hand, i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other.  that is precisely the point of a long dining table.  the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
no!
why?
a lot of things.  all i know is i'll be back in six months.
perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
each to his fate. wait for me at the inn. if i am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
for what? breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
yes, she is.
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio. people start imagining things --
sir?
not all heroes wear masks.
no!  andy, don't do it --
permant cortex bond.
please doyle, don't.
be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
what a gyp.
i have a letter, ma'am.
don't worry about your little pin cushion. to be honest, i'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
i know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  all that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  and you can't take that away now.  you're wrong, peter appleton.  you do belong here.
i can see. and you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
i came on a bus.
remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
hold on.
i'm her sister.
oh, your kids are so adorable.
fine, i'll fuck off, but not til i say something.
this has nothing to do with any of that --
all right, you guys, shake hands.
martins.
oh, yes. give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
okay, yeah.
where do you live?
thank you -- b-b-but i'd really like t-t-to--
yeah.  sometimes.
some gave me a dress.  you know what's great?  what i'm learning? you win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. everywhere i go, we're in the right. i like that.
take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
when did you last see him.
that thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  face it, he's dead.
no, he's not with a girl.
sit down.
hearsay.
i'm sorry, i didn't know.
why not?
tomorrow.  the buyer is japanese. his retirement a condition of the bonus.
that's me.
then don't do it.
you wanna know?  well, since you're so goddamn curious, i'll tell ya.  one of you toons killed my brother.
hi lenore.  it's me.  i got you back.  courtesy of star 69.  are you hurt?
no, that's,..that's fine
just the same, i want one.
well, shit, judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
what's the bad news?
marylin?
it's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean, shell oil and everything -
if i'm working, i can help you.
you're a fucking gentleman.  what do you want from me?
oh no, no. you know what? fuck that. no, you lied to me. you lied to me because you're gutless. you're a gutless, drunken looser.
dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
what for? who are you?
suzanne? very pretty. she was a semi- professional model. but a policeman's wife she wasn't. so one day, she just packed it and left. and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
well... i think i saw her soul.
if i had pulled the trigger, sybok would be dead.
how do you know?
dead?
well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, i got a lot to look forward to. adios.
come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
isn't that your own fault?
the tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
hello.
i'll be your dumb decoy duck.
good night, my little darling.
what, and deny myself the only pleasure i get from him? did i tell you about my birthday?
the del ammo mall mostly.
don't lie to me.
yes. exactly. nothing more complicated than perception.  you explore the universe. we've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
what do i always tell you guys? don't spend it all. sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. save some. put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. that's it. the gig's up.
i wanted to see you.
is that what they teach you at that school of yours? kind of, sort of? everyone knows about this except me! do you know how humiliating that is?
from that moment on, i foresaw what i might be.  already i felt the earth flee beneath me, as if i were being carried away up to the sky.
toys for... adults?
they got a steady stream of supply. so, no...
not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny california was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
yeah.
now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. i just carry that. you been listenin' to them cops too much.
it's just my stupid way of getting attention! god, i practically love you, josh!
this is prince imhotep, high priest of osiris.
yeah?  maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would i be?
i feel so <u>close</u> to you...
i get it.  yeah, i can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
it does!
well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
interesting that you mention it, because i've got the same problem.
i can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
if we make a mistake., he'll burn us. you make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
rifle?
make it so.
okay.
shit.
cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
it's fine.
well he can't have gone far.
that's so long ago, i don't remember.
says what, kenny?
goodbye, darling.
to replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
we got friends in the commission.
well what's the situation?
i'll come to the wedding.
curtis is always more complicated than he seems. even now.
catch another fish tomorrow.
that is not me.
i suppose they told you that...?
i'm going downstairs to get a beer. you want one?
so what?
if you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. it's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
what do you mean?
on tv.
bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, i'm busy.
this could be it.
oh no!  no!  i can't believe it.  i can't believe it.  both of them, both brothers, oh my god!
you better be careful. i heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  hey, what class do we have next?
tell me i'm on the way in.
to seek the grail!
hello?
the police?
yes, yes, go on.
grace skinner. who's grace skinner to you?
okay.
of course.
danny, please, we don't want to know.
well, that's the one that explains how jimmy wang yu became the incredible one-armed boxer.
enough already about it - get to work!
chuckie's address. i sneaked a peek at the rolodex.
i don't know.  everything's so neat. it's all just so...goddamn dear.  damn!
it's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>president</u>...
on accounta you, sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. he's gone.  once and for all.  it was war, max, and you won.
he was a year ahead of us?
no, no, i want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
eh?
only what i read in the newspapers.
i don't know that i can do that, mrs. marsh.
 my two friends have my share of the money.  i'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
if it's a suicide, i seen weirder, jim. 
come on, alice.
hold on... we need to canvass. see if a purple mercury was seen around here tonight.
is this a coup?  alexander, are you trying to tell me that i might be assassinated if i don't agree?
then what's the point?  what's the point of being president?  you're powerless.
you know i love spaghetti.
no.
but why ?
if there is a god, how could he let this happen??!!
listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. quit squawking!
my name is donnie smith and i have lot's of love to give.
good news?
schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
i know the feeling.
because he's probably dead. his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. see, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch prom night they'd save time. there's formula to it. a very simple one. everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
you're kidding, right? tell me what happened, you fucker, or i'll tie your dick in a knot.
college. in illinois. she was playing the cello. i hadn't heard cello music growing up. she had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. when she played, it was...
who were you with?
then don't hassle it.
hello, stew.
okay.  thanks, barney.  you're the best.
will you listen, dammit!
wow!
i don't know
oh, yeah. no. i mean yeah, i stopped by for a drink. didn't see you.
0h, shit!
you used to like it.
did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
what're you, nuts?
no -- i like it.
no.
part of the deal: bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
i wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, mister winston...
but...
i don't never see nobody anyhow.
you'd cosmetically alter simone to look like me?
harry.
bullshit.  from where?
please, eddie, no 'fat lady sings" shit.
well, uh... so we can got into things, i guess.
if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  this time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  the moment when contact becomes possible.  we've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
this time maybe get a widescreen tv. you'll be occupied for weeks.
cool.
it keeps ya busy.
then we smash 'em?
were you always this sick?
then you're as single as i am.
we're not looking to arrest the man, faith, we're trying to locate him.
dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
doesn't matter. i'm on your side.
you are panda, monarch of modems.
it was okay.
like winton marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  louis was playing.  god was smiling.
this is a big day for the guards. they get to remind us who's boss.
man, it's just, like, conversation.
ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
no, not holding hands.
my mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "what?"
i can't.
ugh, not pecs. sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
i've had them since the day they were born.
don't start.
me, too! me, too!
"do chickens give milk?"
how can we be happy?
one bad car accident...
no.
oh yeah?  oh yeah?  then where did i get this?
no doctors. no, sir. not me. doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. fix one-thing, unplug another. operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. my old man, for god's sake, wasn't any sicker'n i am when he went to the doctor.
carmine's gone.
how many people in the bus?
they're moving apart.
you want me to contact starfleet?
met him through santos... clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with santos.
i detest comparisons made with oil.
so why're you even considering it? are you?
thanks.
we were married. then she was taken by the slayers. you must help me.
what?
forget it.
it wasn't that bad.
...you're definitely doing a story...?
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
i was asleep.
'cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. we hit whoever's between us and israel. i don't want to dead the whole floor and i don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
what?
a major!
not without jamie.
now what can i do you for, mister french?
your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
i'll go -- good-bye.
i'll just never learn arithmetic.
nay, sire, i'll cling to it as to life itself...
just come and get it...right here!
we weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. they went right off to washington.
yes,... i see.
so do you.
yup.  usually working on my bike.  no big deal.  if it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
so why are you still here?
that's because you grew up rich.
there won't be any way to stay out of it.
almost.  mocky-lock showed up.
<u>listen</u>!  we both got something out of it, all right!
you damn right they didn't, especially emory, my cousin.
ichiro --
best speed to vulcan. mr. chekov, take the prisoners below.
mr. hardy, i joined the army for college money. i didn't ask for any of this -- i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. you say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. i don't want to die.
i hope you realize, norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
hey, disco dude, it's cool...
shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
it's documented. most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
why, sure, ma'am...
how should i know?
at least you walked.
you don't want to hear about it.
my leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. we must entreat the time alone.
well, for christsakes, you sound like you're selling... i don't know what... cars... not issues.
it wasn't a sign.  it was a coincidence.
everyone know ray calitri? pillar of the community ...
i won't hurt you.
i was thinking about killing myself.
no.
watch me.
randy stetz?
they are looking at you. ann, you are truly breathtaking. i don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. and those that don't or can't resent you. and the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
gruber...
you seem to know all about my destiny.
hold back denver - i'm fine..you..you go on upstairs. i'll do the cleaning up.
what was that?
odd desire for anyone.
she's wonderful.
if she...
i guess so. i gotta stop off home too.
now you're an accomplice in a homicide. everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
any of them hot?
marcie?
i've heard them from mr. garrison a few times before...
yes, ma'am.
good.  that's very good.
oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
desperation?
-- the hotel -- how far? --
fuck me.
yes.
you were just looking around...
i don't want to leave her.  dick ...the, the ... and father laughlin, he said that it was god's will ...
i'm glad you're here. can you stay for a while?
not exactly.
at first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
well, why'd you have to tell that indian story?
are you a gambling man?
i have to meet a client... who're you dating?
--shit--
fine.
amy, i'm not going to let anything happen to us.
you're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  buy one, you get the rest for the same price. you know that.
why'd you live there?
what would you like to be?
you use their witness.
in the trunk?
that's impressive. how did you do that?
which one?
for god's sake, elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  listen to them.
do you think about the game?
bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
then make me your champion and i will always fight in your place.
yeah.  but one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? that's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
i'll say goodbye to you, tita.
now, i have two rubbers.  wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  i don't want you coming so damn early.
i'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  i am dealing with it.
sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
i don't think so, but it don't really matter. they know i'm meeting you.
is that what makes it so delicious?
now wait a minute. you're coming with me. you're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. pool game is over.
i'll explain it to you. do you remember lil's dance?
you know, no offense or anything kate, but i think i'm starting to see larry's side of the story.
i'm on the last page. how do you spell conscience?
i've got something really cool to show you guys. is vanessa here?
i put a lot of effort into these things.
no, linda, you don't understan --
just now?
it's pulling me deeper!
actually, my name is craig schwartz, dr. lester.
hello? is this me? i'm trip. am i on the air?
you actually listen to whitney houston? you actually have a whitney houston cd? more than one?
no. what's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
how are you getting to the airport? you need money for the bus?
beautiful.
if he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
i did. i... this is stolen. i came back.
marty, do you see your suspect?
he's a client of mine! what's the matter. you can't suspect dieter. he's a famous photographer. he makes millions.
what was it?
yeah... guess so.
danny, it's not what you think.
no one has a gun to your head.
i haven't.
that was so great what you just said.
it's up to you. air patagonia. new outfit: via caracas and bogot . no catering. four hundred and eleven pounds. four one one. good value, but refueling at bogot  is variable.
that's right. -- rubbers, too, i hope? a man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
who doesn't?
no, <u>i'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
affirmative, sir. negative, sir. they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
i don't know. i want him to lock me up.
no, son, she is dead.
max - where?
the three of us.
see my nipples?
cool.
nope.
yes, something was...
come on down to the plant.  it's state of the art.  we're doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business.
that's charity. she's out back. she'll be free in half hour.
just as well. the new people just painted it some god-awful color--
i'm okay.
you think i'm rich and you hate me.
tried him once -
thanks, harry.  know anything about colson?
are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
take care, dad.
glad to...
then he's mistaken. you know, i really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
how could i be?  the mainland has been found.  exactly as i said it would.
which brother did this?
baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
or what?  you're gonna shoot me?
careful? was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while i was still in ze womb?
you see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. you know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
but shouldn't it be better? shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
am i?
great.  what do i look like a tourguide?
my lord.
yeah.  have a pleasant vacation?
right here.
i can't tell.
i'm meditating, can't you see? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  i can take a five minute nap, can't i?
what do you want to talk about instead? <u>your</u> day?  that's a fascinating subject.
oh, hey enid...  so... we finally made it!
a.w.o.l.?
it'll only take a second.
no. i only hoped that your knowledge -
the three of you weren't regular patients. you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove.
absolutely.
just what i said i'd do.
they don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
and if it should change?
well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
i can tell you the when part.  tonight.
mr. hypnos, you run this place. i'm begging you. there's gotta be something i can do.
wait a minute. is it a good morning? say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
it's all right gorgeous. something wrong?
groovy.  you should do more of this stuff.
leave your phone on the hook.
i was just trying to make conversation.
nothing.  i said nothing.
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery.  a d-6 is one inch wider than a d-8.  it would be too large for the deceased's well.
well, it's true, isn't it? after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. what do you think?
it opens, too. look inside.
but, reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style.
somebody stole it.
what?  wait -- isn't that dangerous?
well thanks a pile, fella.
which one?
well, you didn't marry her.
mr. weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the fbi. there's lots of footage of you. we know everything.  if you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
you're absolutely right.  we wouldn't.  no sane nation ever would.  that's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
oh--well ...
i don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
"room service!"
what did you see?
in a second...  and you're irresponsible. show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
just tell him to call me.
well -- gentlemen.
at least not anymore.
you think i made that up about the gun...
okay.
the wizard - the wizard - the great and powerful wizard of oz - oz - oz-oz - oz - oz - oz - oz!
how are we doing?
her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
i want to have children.  it's just...
you're welcome. well -- i'll see you later, mrs. robinson.
i'm... not... a... killer.
yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
white tiger!
i'm ready.
what'd he say?
sun's coming up ...  we've been in the fog for six hours.
too bad.  because i'm terrible at 'yes.'
i want to go home.
still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
agreed.
calm down, talby. i'm coming.
you can have the one next to yours if you want. one twenty.  it ain't took.
you think so?...selina?
it would not be the same without you.
ah.
yeah, if you've slept.
i was a hostess at this club, your daddy was performing and i had never laughed so hard in my life. he asked me to come with him.  i quit my job and we've been together ever since.
well, your last words can be "i told you so."
no!
... i've seen them, too.
do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
yeah, right.  we're not gonna get caught.
no problem, master-c. if you've seen one consumer electronics show...  what's up?
i told that kraut a fucking thousand times i don't roll on shabbas.
not if you make it worth my while. how about free boonies for the duration?
right, mack!
fifteen minutes.
amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
what's the movie?
yeah... laurent.
if old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  i'll see you get a proper tour.
you promise?
don't worry about it.
our computer went on the fritz again. david came up to fix it.
please.
i just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  what chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'it's okay, just chuck it'?
i feel fine.
jake, did i ever make you look bad before?
hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, i won't sing it, okay? i'm sorry, you know?
you know who the <u>father</u> is...?
i want to see.
i abhor violence.  sergeant whitman, i hope you don't think me mad --
honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
no, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
we thought it was poison.
it's just a regular day.
leave him alone! come on, let's go.
did you find a scalpel? did you find a murder weapon?
cassie...
what an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
too bad we're heading west.
i don't understand..  reveal yourself to me!
a what?
no.  and...
max is paying for it. he and lloyd had a terrific row but lloyd insisted... well. can i fix you a drink?
physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
come on. let's go.
i can't find the second one, sir.
i can hear you again, clearly.
anna?  with this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause i'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
we'll see...
oh, if there is only time!
i want to talk to general ripper.
victor did.
forget me, forget what i did for you. don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. get it?
well, where are you from?
of course.
it's shit.
yes.
well, i just placed a call to your mother.  she had stepped out but i have some news for her.
yes, i see. when i had trouble getting out of lille, why didn't you leave me there? and when i was sick in marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
i'm kind of busy, norma.
i was kinda hoping, yeah.
usually they take clothes.
that's a word you're too free with lately, jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
what are you now?
you're one of the best, curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
i know.  now shut it. you say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
i never heard that.
the creator of what?
then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, mr. lawford.
everything.
no?
this kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. if he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. but it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. and even worse the kid is good at it. i mean i had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
he's a vegas entertainer.  i used to do impressions of him.  we sorta... got in a fight over that.
i can't.
no.  i call it like i see it.  i'm a journalist.  i'm a truth teller.
i feel pretty.
it is
fine, just stay out of my way.  hit it.
you said you had it all lined up.
i can't help it. even with the business we're in, i -- it gets me every time. it's so -- optimistic.
our...? oh!  he seems fine. i guess we woke him. the lights and all.
yes... and i only had enough silver halide for one shot. so you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
do you want to deliver this baby?
if you say another word, it's over.  i'm not playing!
tell him we'll meet.
a simple exchange, mr. grant. corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the wall of the lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
i'll be out this afternoon, remember?  your family can visit as long as they like.
she's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
christy.  christy van cartier.
ah.
no.
maroon.  i stole it.
quite the opposite, in fact.
he's real.
because that's the part i believe is true. you probably did help her somehow with the boy and eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts i pulled.
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
i... i...
don't worry. doctor schneider will be there to meet you.
my mother used to hum this to me. like her mother hummed it to her. and my great grandmother carolyn hummed it to her.
sir, let those laugh that win.
thanks for getting me back in one piece.
jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. she-she was too busy getting raped by cossacks.
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer, isn't she?
you got a better offer?
well, i don't...
it's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. my child. my beloved child.
bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
shut the fuck up.
oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
enh.
maybe. are you ready for the next chapter?
i have a suggestion...
that's not good enough.
and where is this guest?  don't they want to interview him.
you said he was no possible connection with tom. the page girl told you that, not tom.
will she scratch up your back?
she's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
i despise it.
yes!  i was abso-- and...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
there's nothing further to be gained from this...
give me a break, would you?
you said you couldn't remember killing officer harrison. correct?
you're a dead man!  a fucking dead man!
listen, i'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
no, no, i don't want to go to bed. i want to be here for the party.
you know what i'm saying.
and admiral, it's the enterprise.
why did you come here tonight, linda?
what's with the eyelids?
affirmative.
andy, don't raise your voice.  we don't wish your presence here.
kitchen closes at eight but i'm the night clerk. i can always ring out for sandwiches.
louis is planning a visit to the vatican, then who knows where after that.  if we miss him now we may not get another chance.
you don't need to screw around anymore. you don't need dwayne steele or odets or your mother. you need me.
breakfast brunch -- ?
i'd better get back to my elevator. i don't want to be fired.
t stands for total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'all my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the lord.'
that's it.
speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  we're gonna get them wet unless we find a sonoco station.
he'll never know.
nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  not you or jeffrey or anybody else.  you've created something in your mind, james -- a substitute reality. in order to avoid something you don't want to face.
-- brought against sparazza by israel's mother laverne who was nineteen at the time. they had a brief affair which israel was the by- product of.
yeah.
i see... and i understand.  then everything that he was... everything that he knew... is lost. and when i return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
what about her?
not tonight.
it is already done.  i have just stopped at mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
don't tell me my business!  quarter-mile, that way. full throttle.
well well well, what's going on in here?
my father and the baron.
really?
could you bring it up?
yeah?  say, you're sold on the john doe idea, aren't you?
i'm not saying anything, harry, i'm just stating the facts.  the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
yes, she takes care of the garden.
there ain't none in your daddy. you know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. i not only love him, i respect him, i admire him.
a little.
yay! it'll be great! i'll get my shit.
yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
you have a right to be angry.
i don't know much about biomechanics, roy.  i wish i did, but you're out of my league.
done.
and i assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
i'm just afraid i'll hurt peter. i think i love him.
he wouldn't leave her.
for instance...  it says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
another additional.
well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. and so will you. it just didn't work out, walter.
my dear, sweet, baby sister, i'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
please see to mister bromden.
maybe you should go, alex.you'll meet someone wonderful.
fine.  i'll say no.
they don't call them lovers in high school, leland.
yeah?
i just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
and you were the last one to talk to him.
where are you gonna go?
no, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
you can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. you should get rid of them.
i got greedy.  i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  that was my mistake. carl would never be so stupid.
hiya yourself.
well, i can assure you, it won't happen again.  thanks for your concern.  goodbye.
not here, major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, major...
even?
are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
yeah, i know, he was up here. it's pitiful like you say. when he lost rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost rose.
can, mistah.  take me to dat nex' place.
wait for what?
i don't know. it's my last night as acivilian. i ship out for tereshkova tomorrow.
ben, i think we're two civilized human beings. do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
ahhhhhhh!
this cannot be.
really?
oh yeah?  the hell you weren't. little pither just out of school...
no?
that's what you said before.
yeah?
are you okay, violet?
ah, history i think.
scobie -- he's the one that objected.
or just knock us over.  look, use the bomb!
then we need to do a few things right away. no pierre. he knows, the press knows. you're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. and we need to get these guys out of the white house. george ball's got a conference room at state.  reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
where from?
pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please henry.
you're shelly?
andy... it's me.  i've got some crummy news.  taxi's been canceled.
right.  it was someone's birthday. halloran?
easy. we're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. some kind of animals. real fast, volatile, predators. one went through three of your patrons like they were kleenex.
do they show it?
i'm not the police.
yes, yes, please sit down.  i will be with you in a moment.
it's not that... it's not that...
i understand you were in africa. whereabouts?
you're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
you start it off. i don't know anything about it.
thanks, old buddy.  i'll be with you in a second.
you're going to kill him?  kill morpheus?!
not exactly.  she was found in a canal, disembowelled.  throat cut. blood drained.  the body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
but you're perfect for it. you're young, you're single, you're successful...
xxxxxx
becky?
in my sleep.
don't like her?   what's wrong with her?  she's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
if you see him.
check.  then i just hang with these guys, right?
nothing serious.  a touch of stroke.
-- i know what you mean. i was there, alright. seti's place. the city of the dead.
remember?  we were in the dayroom, watching tv, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. and you said to me, "wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  you do remember that, don't you?
wasn't enough time.  generator was out, what...?  thirty minutes. takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
please! no calls! i'm feeling very fragile.
there's always a loophole with you, claremont. your black ass is one big loophole. <b> int. vegas security lockdown -- [flash forward] night
find her, get her and tell her i want to talk to her, mary.  fucking hell.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
so?
it's off... i can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. we're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
no. she doesn't talk about you anymore.
in general.
and why would i do that?
you said you'd never leave woodsboro, 'the only place that's real!'  but now you're here. not with me.  dewey, i took care of you.  i waited until you were well.  i couldn't stay there, i mean, it's like dog years, one year in woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
he had help getting up there.  two of his fingers are broken.
we keep them, in case the people come back.
why not? she's an attractive young woman.
i don't think you do.
what is it?
i'd like to see you try.
i'm not experimenting.  why don't you go experiment.
it's over.
-- fine, fuck, i got it... lake tahoe, nevada. i'll have hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. he'll meet you at the airport.
...i'd really have to show it to you.
epps...epps!  i'm gonna stop for a second.
you're with me now.
boring.
you're not allowed to hand me money, sir. you'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet earth.  this is hilarious: he thinks it's god, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
she made a play for me after i got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. every time we got into a clinch, i'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. an eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. the minute i started thinking about it, mr. johnson would get all soft and small. and i can't see getting married if mr. johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
yes, but...
you're lying.
correct me if i am wrong... we are facing north, aren't we?
not at all!
did it break?
debbie, don't be naive. men are pigs.
we had it done last christmas. would you like to see it?
bank robbery? do you know what he does for ordell?
no, i don't have time.
when we were up poking around his place... i found this...
are you a homosexual?  interesting non-sequitur.
i called the jag corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to d.c. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
spock! my only concern is getting the ship back. when that's done and sybok is in here then you can debate sha ka ree until you're green in the face. until then, you're either with me or you're not.
do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
summer's over.  it's fall.
what?  wait a minute -
if you don't - can you still afford to go to harvard?
he's fine. okay mikey, let's go.  you guys stay here.
well, what's the matter?
of course not! i'm a wanderer!  i'd like to go somewhere i've never been!

parents still together?
these are not polite suggestions. they are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
yes.  the man made a business decision.

oh my god.  oh my god.
i'm a good boy, but no one listens to what i say.
the one on the left.
where did you get this?
help you i can ... yes ... yes.
i tell you "officer", it wasn't...
i didn't know.  i was in a panic.  i guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. the nearest hospital was forty miles away, and zoe was continuing to swell.  klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while i dialed the hospital.  i finally got a doctor on the line.  he sounded young, but cool.  he was confident, but there was a nervousness.  he have been an intern.  this was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  he wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as i was.
yeah. that warehouse over on merchant street. the volume on our import business has risen dramatically. the proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
i don't know.
we have all -- what?
i'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. they turn black against black, that's how they do.
ohhh yes.  no, no.  just a little, you know...we're fine.
liverpool?
what?
yeah, dad. it's great.
no, private, i want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
now don't you worry about that. you just leave it all to me. we won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... i'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... no, sir... not me! ...
or i won't.  i can't help her.  i'm out of my depth.
why not?
but you triple-dog-dared me.
in a saloon?
yeah.
i don't really follow baseball anymore.
yeah --
fallen one... we have such sights to show you!
what are you talking about?
too early to tell.
i've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
oh, i'm sorry, wait a minute, i have something. well, what about saturday night?
you ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
w... we didn't know how to make one.
for climbing.
nothing--i just found out that jeb magruder from creep is a bigger bike freak than i am.  i never like it when the other guy's human...
yes, thank you mr. president.
you did?
but, somehow, it was kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. and you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
how did you find out?
i came back. i thought that's what you wanted.
evil.
shhh!  come on.  tell us something!
just looking around.
no.
i don't know, sir. your dear parents.  suddenly gone. so much loss...
gentlemen, i go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
...to talk about it. to think about it. i had a plan to ease her into it. but, i really -- i didn't know how to do that...
hum a tune and i'll sing to it.
why not?
you are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  that was my misfortune.  that was your misfortune.  i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was.  i had no choice.
yes... a little white house.
you must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
i heard that.
you were wandering around.
isn't it a fact that you served romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the federation because of its overwhelming potency?
and who are you?
well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
oh, yeah. steph's way into pinots and syrahs.  hey, steph? you sure we can open anything? anything we want?
i wish you'd...
better than my lieutenant.  he failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as i'd hoped on our last encounter.
no, thank you.
shut up, cleo.  di, how much do you need for an abortion?
it's scurvy's.  his date got convicted. where'd you get the dress?
that's right!  there's no way i'm going to finish the new processor now.  forget it.  i'm out of it.  i'm quitting cyberdyne tomorrow... i'll sell real estate, i don't care,,,
wife, huh? i'd love to meet her, craig.
he wants us to know he's hunting us now.
eastern europe.  like what?  romania? hungary?
no! just no!  i have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and i'm near it. there's just so much pushing i can take and i think...
can it, pluchinsky. and shove some cotton up your nose.
and where you goin'?
so you're just quitting?  just like that?
oh, really? you wanna go look?
i'm the chief.  i don't carry it.
still, there have been rewards.  it's sunny.  and some of the producers who call even have credits.
wish i was.  oldest part of the system down there.  we're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
i only live up there and across the roof.
why don't you go get them?
i read this book, book on spiritualism...
get a hold of yourself.
yes, you did.  they never tested you, did they?  but internal affairs knew.
what do you think it's like?
fuck you.
that's not fair! i was honest! just because i wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch catherine.
no.
bill, he's a crazy man.
if the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, i invented precrime.
what happened, michael!?
coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
who's there?
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade. would you like to see my wound?
look, i've got a wife.  i don't care if either of you ever get caught.
yeah, well, it depends on the artist. you know, jose feliciano, ya got no complaints. waiter!
man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
she got me thinking...
did you learn anything?
did he tell you where he was going?
you're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
i'm working down in san diego. just for a few weeks.  thought i'd drop in on my long-lost son.
minutes ago.  harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
...never reads the paper...
what would joanne braslow need with an estate attorney?  she wasn't even mentioned in marsh's will.
he told me. besides, why else would an a.t.f. man be after him?
you'll call me, right?
yes.  later.
i'm afraid i'm not able to tell you much. only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a mr. paul holland with whom we do considerable business.
well, it's finally happened.
i think it's marvelous. truly.
hello, eve.
no.
what's his name?
look dad, i'm not a salesman. how many times i gotta tell you i'm an account executive, and pretty soon i'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
jesus fucking christ.
he's pushing it through first thing. you better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
yes.
oh god, jeffrey, is that you? oh god.
i got there from "coin," dude. coin, coin... kwaaaan.
great.
to wilson.
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow?
come on now.  people are smart.
not at first, but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put two and two together.
no. come on.
i'm going to call.
'art thou the king of the jews'?
i know that.
what?
i'm glad you've come to talk with me, doolittle. it's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
why are these all opened?
never can tell what he's going to do.
i didn't realize i was out.
what?
that's strange isn't it? not remembering one fever... or a cold... or a sore throat. what do you think that means?
he'd want to know about all this.
oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time i spent teaching you? we've discussed wittgenstein, for christ's sake. not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
well i don't want to order anything, you see. i have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and i'm not sure who i should talk to or what i should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if i explain myself?
don't take another step.
right. well, she didn't, exactly...
the only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
i don’t do naked. my sister? she does naked.
let me do something.
what did you think of him?
why do people think i'm you?
in about fifteen minutes.
elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  i know these kids.  i don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
arm yourself, bomb.
well if you're bailing, i guess i'd better give you your surprise now.
i don't know.
what about job?
sometimes twice.
if anyone can help, he can.
let me just clarify a few things.  i don't care what kind of cop you are in china, you have no jurisdiction in america.  without me you are just another tourist.
mm.
well now, launcelot, galahad, and i wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the french by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
you are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
no, dear, of course not. he's a very nice man. i just think he might prefer to be left alone. now you get to bed and forget about it.  'night, darling.
'terrorists?'
sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
simple math. when i woke up this morning and saw your smile... i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
that's alright.  don't misunderstand my husband.  it's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. and who would believe him if he told the truth?
sign me up.
because i want to make it tough for you.
ryan's novel.
no.
you like ... left me a card?  at the club?
no! he was crazy. i didn't -- he looked -- i thought --
well, we'll see you later, bob.
i like glaucus.
fuck you.
did she say that?
fine, i just --
because faith is rewarded.
) there is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. it is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering lindenmeyer created it.
appreciate it.
how did i get in?  you're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. what is that?
thank you, miss boatwright.
the same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
nobody knows more about this thing than you do, john.
for daniel zavitz. i just need a signature.
i don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. mr vitovetch is a good friend of the judge.
i have to talk to you.
oh, yah?
why should they think that?
you know what's good for him?
thank you, roger.
have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
yes, baron.
i cannot promise you that.
desmond.
i'm sorry. it's these goddamned shoes. i don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
after last night i could say the same for you.
well blaze your ass out of there! you've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
nope.
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
what, your dick?
uh-huh.
she's talking to him now.
oh, yes.
fro-derick!
what?
i didn't think i could sleep. i'm surprised you could. are you all right?
no.
how?
what am i gonna do?! i mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
hmm... my biggest hit?  that would probably be "dracula."
listen, i'm the one help jack escape from prison.  he tole me, i can't find him to see you.  so why don't you open this fucking door.  okay?  so we can speak.
wouldn't want that...  okay -- just one more.
a boy?
well, her, it ain't. that bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
he has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
what have you done?
i just have time to get the, uh-
oh, for god's sake. really, cynthia, really, i don't think he's your type.
see you at 8:30, jam. later.  dudes? later.
you mean smashed!  she called up at midnight last week.  talking a bunch of crap.  pat can't stand her.
whatever i can get away with.
miles, i gotta tell you something. victoria's coming to the wedding.
damnit, i just hadda bust out! my wife wrote me she was gettin' married! i gotta stop it!
not now.  she's emotional.  her mother dies today.  scene forty-two of "good for nothing".  it's not a good time.
brilliant. this is so much fun. i never want it to end.
what do you mean no?  they can fly us home.
it's going back down.
thank you.
yes, he's a little bit... tilted. harmless, though.
...goodnight, rocky.
do you want to talk to him?
of trust. tell me your plan.
it's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
well, don't preach wisdom to me. you talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
yes.
convulsion?
i'm not.  i was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
very well ...
prepare for a change in lifestyle.
... we've got a committee meeting.
i guess you did.
night, night, honey.
it's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
am i home?
what is it now?
his lightsaber.
oh, i don't know...
yeah, i guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
things happened. i can't take 'em back.
maybe it had something to do.
i will not.
um...look, there's something i've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and i just thought i'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
tell me about your adopted mother
we don't know that, ray...
where do you think he got it? mental illness is heriditary. who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
yes, i should think so.
you sound bitter.
i can. because i choose it.
i thought you were a smart guy.
why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
i'll be okay.
permission granted.
the "chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, mr. carter.  it says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
now.
girl?  oh.  elizabeth taylor.
i'm only asking you to look at this, doctor. either you will or you won't.
the thing to do is stick to rabbits.
no.
i followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, i reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
when we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? do you remember your address?
it's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. there must be fifty hotels in san remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
i just wanted to see her, that's all.
it is a fucking game.  you said so yourself, dude--she kidnapped herself--
cool!
then, please, which is correct? you've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? which is the lie. when were you lying?
yeah, i thought he was supposed to be helpful.
am i free to go?
he's just afraid to show it. aren't you, little brother?
all right, mickey.
i'm clay phillips.  my brother steve.
or maybe crossing a river!
i've got frank...frank earl's son. he's...he asked me to get him and i did --
it isn't a man.
never a break. never.
terrific.  i now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
the shark will get it for us.
no, sir!
because i wasn't worthy.
that kind of remark is pointless. now come on -- i want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
not particularly.
i'll take a raincheck, laurie.
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital?
she seems very nice.
so what did you find.
ryuji bandaio. grown near here.
i had so much i always wanted to say to him. at least he had a chance to give you the ring.
no, i haven't.
fuck it! hold tight!
if it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
that would be inconceivable.
don't be absurd; it's only a play.
oh, no!
charlie, i thought i knew everything about you.
i'll show you.  ulla, go to work.

thank you. but when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
don't we already have someone to do that for us?
i had such an awful dream.
they said five hundred.  i said six. they said the man in the gray flannel suit.  i think i said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?

these guys, man, they're crazy.  shit.
then let's change the subject.  what do you think about forced school busing?
rocky balboa -- his record's poor --
which maneuver, sir? the one in which i moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which i cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
whatever it is, it's dark.

all right then.
how do you mean 'exploited'?
i think i know my son.

i have little time for your mercenary concerns, but i am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  what is your price?
but why be so concerned about me?
tell me!

claudia.
with ramón it's ... pride. i spoke out of the bitterness in me. and he was hurt.

he was very good. better than some people would think.
i'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
don't... don't do this... please...
what i will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. you know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.

so?
sorsha, queen bavmorda's daughter.

what?!
did you know he's already got a bad knee? in another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
how can it be bullshit to state a preference?
only in the movies.
it beets being on the mainland.
i was backpacking.  hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the burning man festival.  we were gonna take "e", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  you know the riff, "dear penthouse, i never thought this would happen to me, but --"
hi.
that's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
i'm not convinced you should be happy.
no, sid.
do you have life support?
<u>it was a pact</u>.  you break it and there are no excuses.  you guys have to --
you wanna die?
find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
for real?  a treasure?
friends don't help other friends cheat.
that's it? i mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? we could play games and watch movies and stuff.
- and easy or not, i won't believe a word.
it will be more than that, i can promise you.

lenin's tomb.
you're looking great, baby.

go have fun. not too much.
you can't.
that's the first time you've been right today. that's what i --
what?
i know. but i've converted most of them into ridiculous "guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. woman things. personalize it. marylinize it. make this your house.
there's a little girl on board who's ill and...
hidden camera.
what is this? is this a... present?  are you kidding?
you'd think so.
gina in the miami pad.  you gonna give me phony denials?
i need you.
i'm talking about prayer.
what's it going to do, being a plant?
don't get ahead of yourself. you'll probably need it before i will.
i believe the phrase dr. hoag used was "titanically remote."  who knows?  maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  or maybe god really is on my side after all.  by the way, i know you don't get the papers in here.
with his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the vistula river, napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a polish lancer.

'cause they's little pigglies! they's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! but norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...

so graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two i'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
it's about atlanta and birmingham.
why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
i got through to greer, his partner in the detective business.  greer won't give out.
just 'cause i'm not like little miss honor roll here--
that's what the police thought. i told them i'm unemployed, how could i have anybody work for me? now i bail out jackie, i'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
why ain't that pick swinging?

i'm in san francisco five days a week. with a lot of time on my hands. i'd like to see you.  maybe we could go swimming or something. mother tells me you like to swim.
long live the fighters!
i can't believe we invited ian malcolm.

faint.
trust me, he's already here. get going!

sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  but i'm trying to be honest, okay?  three years is a long time.  don't ask me to predict how i'll feel then, jordan, because i don't know.  and either do you.
yeah. take it.
so what's wrong with that?
i promised her i'd keep it secret. i can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
this is ho-jon, my houseboy. our houseboy. i'm teaching him english.
i feel like a dick.  you must think i'm a dick.
yes.
perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
how am i gonna do that?
i prefer to stay in the less frivolous professions.
unreasonable!  have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
ok.  ok.
look, look, look, look, canada, okay...?  our neighbor to the north, alla sudden, transformed, into that place, where, like the north wind, <u>terror</u> comes...
sorry.   i didn't mean to pry.
aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. anyroad, i'd better get back.
why did you say she might be hiding from me? did she say anything to you about me?
eight o'clock.  kross is bringing his son.  very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  who's this girl you're taking?
depends on the mind.  but eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
the mountains?
go on.
god, no.
what are you, nuts? you think she's coming back?
who the fuck knows?  we'll find out soon enough.
not that often.  he was excited to see you.
i know.  relax.  take it easy.  don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
i don't know if i can with my leg.
lucky girl.
i'm going to play my records all day
mourning. maybe watch some t.v. why?
with spy satellites. i don't like saying these things senator...
whatever makes you happy.
it was very strange. he called me at six this morning. hobbes called me. i thought i was dreaming. i haven't heard that voice for so long. he told me who it was, then he said something like, 'meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. i want you to go out for lunch with me. it's time you furthered your education.' then he laughed and hung up. i went back to sleep. he called me again at eight to remind me to come.
what're you talking about -- i'm not a dope fiend! i saw it! i'll show you!
i await the word of vigo.
it's not what it looks like!
thanks for looking after him.
this is empty, just coming!
oh, really?  one-hundred billion dollars.  ok, make it happen. anything else?
i defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
you think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. you think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  you think you're so hot just because you broke the ensenada tape piracy ring...
i'm inviting you. i mean if you're not located, i got a place. i'm inviting you, goddamit.
oh thank god. maybe this whole thing is really over.
what?
i think i'll cut out here, chief.  i gotta get home.
oh, i'll be back before christmas.
i'll keep in contact. you have the bridge.
yes indeed.  fuck! they're erasing you, clem!
not exactly. sometimes, though, i wish i understood you better.
thanks for the coffee.
well...my home "sector" was called paramus ...
donnie.
yeah, a drink. 'civilized,' right?
who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music - shostakovich, prokofieve, and myaskovsky.
i don't buy that reform story for a minute. and even if i did, i certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. so why?
it's not apparent.
nothing...
well, let's go talk to your doctor.
they said a hundred thirty-fifth and twelfth.
let's just call it square.
the lost footage. at the convention. the mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
did he rob it?
i see the help -- judgement call.
it doesn't hurt.  why doesn't it hurt?
anti-shark cage.
and keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
here's to ed.  for making us into something.
who's this?
you were? i thought you were chasing me?
you're just saying that.
if it were only that simple, my young friend.  read on, gentlemen. read on.
you mean the <i>times</i> guy?
yeah.
some people don't think it's healthy.
sure. what other reason would there be?
it's not that kind of job.
just a statue.
it worked for weir. prep the tanks.
what do you think his name is?
was there anything unusual about the driver, dolores driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
looks like they're preparing the invasion.
what?
must i? well, i won't! i tell you straight: i will not!
i think we just need to get wasted.
i don't need proof.  i know it.  send it out.
to the fleet.
congratulations.  who's the lucky girl?
fuck regrettable!  i want to know why.
just fine.  it's a lovely party.
next week.
you know what i want you to do? get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
fine.  did you have a good time last night?
why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, mcmurphy.
that le renard has the power to lead his people into the light, i know well.
if you think it would help.
a hunting accident. jack and twombley.
shhhh...
i didn't say you did.
what are you trying to say?
the sun also rises.  for whom the bell tolls.  the old man and the--
too bad.  we'd be out of here in a few hours.
well then why'd it happen?
the bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
...people talk to me more.
sure.
oh yes. i'm very lucky.
what "revenge" is he talking about?
that's none of your business.
uh...where...where do you want to go?
dad--
don't look like nothing.
i have to reach him.  this is an emergency.  could you give me his home number?
that's it. that's it! i'm calling the police.
look out for number one. always number one.  i should've known you wouldn't tell me. pop said johnny friendly used to own you. i think he still owns you.  no wonder everybody calls you a bum.
yeah, nice meetin' you.
no.
i can't stay on this planet.
keep it going, alex. you're unstoppable now.
i hesitated for what seemed like forever.
your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. sure wish i could have met him --
if you were tore up i would not be claiming you.  trust.
it's how he works.
oh my god, steven.
hunt with vince?
looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
don't you ever see him?
make any money?
disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
erica. so do you think you and i are alike, erica?
and sit behind a desk?  chairborne?
you're still eight pounds over.  what's the reason for this?
i'll take that as a compliment.
annie...got an umbrella...?
captain, i've scanned the planet. the atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. the oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
th—that's all right. if you didn't call me sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  there are snickers from the background.
our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
not me. ain't never loved anybody. ain't never been married. won't either.
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
god, that's... this is ridiculous.
am i?  or am i making so much sense that you're going insane?
excuse me, but what are you talking about? didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? it was on the cape station news.
nothing.  we made it to the hospital.  i didn't have to go as far as i was prepared to.  but i was prepared to go all the way.
yeah?!
i lied to you, i didn't destroy the floppy disks.
yes, he is... look, bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when i say next train, this time i mean it!
because i made a vow. never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
i know...i know.
oh ethan!..
why?
you bet we did.
i didn't mean it that way.
ed, you've got to snap out of this. bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
he said he's coming back!
he also figured out how to kill the pilot, fry.
we are the keepers of the sacred words.  ni ... peng ... and neee ... wom!
you're kidding.  can't you shoot him or something?
it's my favorite place --
we were satisfied.
all right, look--
well can i come in or not?
okay, how much time do you need?  i mean, you know, i mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
it's the truth...  i need you.  i know you're innocent.
then do it. the rescue ship can find us here right?
i'll have to go to a new school -- again.
take me away...
all right -
i'd love to.
she's right. it's none of my business.
no. i don't want to see you.
you're not listening.  really know what you're going to do before you do it.
what?! i can't hear you!
get the sodding gate open now, plank.
but suppose it doesn't?
i'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
what...
with a knife.  i found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. the kind of shred a pipe threader makes. i was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. it took a long time. in one place there was a resignation letter from a man named hobbs. i saw it and it was..., peculiar.  i was going up these stairs to hobbs' apartment. i was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. she was dying.  i sent the officer with me to call a swat team. but i could hear kids in there and screaming. i couldn't wait.
oh, no. plenty of cause. he won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. and he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
know what ? that it was your fault ?
just another bureaucratic foul-up. you know how these pencil-pushers are.  so, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
shows how much you knew.
...everything i know.
what holds you back, max?  tell me. why does life scare you so much?
cardiff giant?
they're mine.  i'm turning in my running shoes to you.
we're still in earth orbit.
no time, magda, my show's starting.
hey, bad throat, huh j-man?
yeah. thanks.
ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
they're...  perfect.  thank you.
huh?  you're implying i'm some kinda psycho criminal?
someone help me! i'm still alive, only i'm very badly burned.
how can you possibly?  i've got to get right on the plane.  i'm leaving now.
oh george, this is bob zmuda.  bob and i have been buddies for years.
he's been dead for three months.
"we just got up and left. bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
will you shut up!
well. i suppose it does a bit. i'm very happy for them, of course, but i'm going to miss them. the ship will seem... incomplete without them.
what about the obvious remedy? reversing things.  maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
we don't have time, smith. in twenty hours we run out of air.
i want to watch.
you what?
i'm better than that.
come on, walter!.
what does it look like ... i'm collecting empties.
how do you mean, strange?
christ.
and a hundred thousand if i go to jail.
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
and what did your team do...
edward rama?
did you call someone you knew?
can i get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
that would presuppose a feeling, commander... compassion. i sensed <u>no</u> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
what are you coming here to do?
mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
yes.  well... yes.
hi, i'm-i'm tony lacey.
no, let me go.
i don't need a job. i have a quest.
do you always live like this?
the letter he sent.
there's nothin' to know. you have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although i've seen scripts where i know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. so i don't think it's too important. anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
hurry!  queen cherlindrea will know what to do.
uh huh. under a safe conduct from me.
oh... are you... ?
yeah, unhappy and fat.  and i still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
you did well...
because i don't want to see him hurt.
what?!
something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. go back to dallas and dig. or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, agent mulder. when it's too late.
and nothing. thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "i don't have a father. as far as i'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
sorry.
pitch-black?! it -
did you talk to corey?
the vodka.  what'd i tell you?
where?
sorry, i should have explained. you see, i have this condition -
no, i can't wait. you know when i wait? when it's important to wait. it's not important to wait for no steak. it's important to wait for reeves to leave the ring. it ain't important to wait for no steak! i won that fight. so, i stayed in the ring, and that way i made sure everybody knew it. i shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
good.
looks to me like your out of business. now i want some answers.
now listen. now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. think of sebastian as a tutor. let him instruct you.
bye.
shut up, miss henried! i tol' ya b'fore!
don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
yes, sir.
there isn't anyplace else --  except the worker bar.
scotty, don't prejudge. a ship is a ship.
i presume nothing, i am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  perhaps even your children, senator.
la plume de ma tante.
i'd fucking kill you.
if a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
what's your name?
right now--everything i own--!
i'm heading out of town.
i know.  but you've never met.  it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
well, i wouldn't mind.  but my name's daniel stone.
yeah--
sometimes a wound will kill.
forsythe, forsythe! what's wrong? what's happened?
what else is new?
two hundred meters.
i have to go.
i don't know what you mean.
yeah?
do what?
... an offlander?
pittsburgh, two years ago. partner died, no back-up, i was too gung-ho. as usual.
he don't believe in it?  you don't believe in it?
i'm glad you like it. it's made right here in the valley.
so he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
my brother.
mr. gittes...
you're not gonna believe this...
i appreciate you looking out for me.
i know.  hey, don't mind me.  i'm being stupid.  i'll think about it, okay?  it's a real good offer for a whore.
jim was old enough...
sorry, i just didn't remember.
i'm afraid if i stop talking i'll lose you.  just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
then who are you?
so.  how do we get to rome?
my father died in jail, and he was twice the man i am.
no dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
well, fuck you, too, and fuck michael jordan.
take your kids.  go to a hotel.  right now. don't pack.  let's go.
i don't know how he does it.
we ain't goin'! we ain't goin' without you, debbie...ethan, get the horses...i'll try to keep her talkin'...
never heard of it.  it's got no day or date.  hell, it ain't even got numbers.  what's the matter?  you couldn't afford a timex?
right, agent cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  he didn't call?
nigger, fuck me hard!
i have a question for you.
i can't find him.
no. no, it don't. i can't do that. i can't let m'self. all i can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. they'd all get upset if i done anymore 'n that. they all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  that's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
where?
mostly it feels like driving.  you digging for buried treasure?
no cheese.
we need milk....
a mother-fuckin' peace conference.
right.  we plan ahead.  that way we don't do anything right now.  earl explained it to me.
it's just carpet.
thanks.
will, your not getting off that easy.
yes.
creasy. just call me creasy.
we need beer....
it's gone out so quickly?
nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while i'm waiting.
look, she's got paint on her toenails! oh lord, whatever i done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. oh you lucille!
go wherever you want.  live how you want.
i unnerstand.
a cheap trick.
it's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
wait'll you see!
i'm sorry?
i don't know if i can. it's just that war is war. things happen.
lieutenant  quinn.
go fuck yourself.
great.
you think she's gonna make it?
where'd she go?
the beach of pacifica, california.
sure.
yeah, but how do we get to them?
is his back feeling better?
we don't have a relationship.
of course.  he's going to steal the giant white diamond.
right first time.
how was dive class?
oh, captain, my captain. is there poetry in math?
... yes?
there were a lot of variables to consider --
nothing.
it means it's too cold to go swimming.  and i don't mean the water.
energize defense fields.
you didn't answer my question.
david!
that's great.
business folks.
you coming to party tonight, ostreicher, ya fuckface?
you know a lot of happily married people, sam? 'cause i don't.
not from me, surely...
how about this child? you expect *her* to be responsible?
it's something i've always wanted to do.
we're all of us beasts, my dear. only most are afraid to show it.
and you get into any car you want and just drive off?
yes.  you walking to the subway?
think.
good. you've both been working close to the front.
not before i settle with you.
pretty embarrassed, to be honest. i had him.
--shit!!!
ma -- ma -- it's all right, ma!
i just wanted to say “hi.”  did you know i still don't know your name or where you work?
annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and misery's spirit is still alive--
if we step on a mine we'll know it was. let me see the maps.
will it track back to us?
uh-huh?
they'll start to soon enough.
i've got something for you.
yeah?
moose.
did she talk about him to you?
stacy. 
what kind of friend do you think i am?
yeah.
empire had the better ending: luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out vader's his father; han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett.  it ends on such a down note. and that's life-a series of down endings. all jedi had was a bunch of muppets.
what, anna? what did i do? what's made you so sad?
well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
yes, dad.
is that a fact.
good.
rye.
don't uncle claude me. you get a load of those crackers? couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
...but what'd she do?
ketchup? who eats ketchup on a hot dog? mustard's what you want.
well i know how it went with cecile. she won't shut up about it. how'd it go with mrs. jesus?
christ, we created frankenstein with those fucking cubans.
i've been on the job.
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago.
just save your breath, wayne. we hate you. if anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
no. no more. i'm getting sleepy.  thank you very much, mr...?
hi, thorn.
yeah, i sort of thought so myself.
good afternoon, mr brumby. carter exits.
no, i-i've been perfectly healthy. you know me.
it's happened before.  i'm shocked by how little i'm feeling. i can't understand it.  i'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't i?
no!  they're still on their way.
that's funny, you're cute.
why do i have to lie in the road?
the polacks? from sacred heart?
all right, grab the bat. let's see what you can do.
the government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. but they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. the viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
they don't know that.  we were the only one's on deck. look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  i'm a kid.
yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
that makes it unanimous. i feel all right too.
oh, yeah, you had to go to highgate. that must've been intense.
and maybe that's why i had the bad luck. maybe if you gave me away, and i got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then i wouldn't had the bad luck i had.
out the back.
well, it's your business to get news! and here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the tribune scoop us on it. making a first class grade a monkey out of me. if it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. that's all.
don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then i won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
what do you want me to say?  that i thought i'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did?
yes.  i made the choice that was right for me.  and i don't regret it.  but even for me, there were days when i felt so lost, so invis- ible.  and then i'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
old woman!
i left him a message.
i'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... selina will probably be there ...
yes, doctor.
and when was that check cashed?
you do see me standing here, right?
yeah. and right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
you? frighten me? that's a good one! i'm twice as fast as you are. who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
oh no, sir. i putter with me hands.
no.
quite.
what are you talking about? he's fine. he's out of the hospital already. the ratings are higher than ever.
come on, saavik, you could knock -
but you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
look at me.
i remember..
prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
can i ask how much is this?
on the men, in the room, arguing about the illegal alien, schumann in the b.g.
conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
what'll i tell the kids?
praetor shinzon, i'm pleased to...
yeah, but i'm not in jail and i tried.
does it eat?
i'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  you look beautiful like that.
whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the paradiso when you were little... 
not by you.  i will order d'artagnan to do it.
i don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  we're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
they can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
good morning, mr. dyle.
you know, dana, i'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  i'm still into all this stuff, you know.  haven't you ever seen my show?
oh, it's the bit of a girl fettes was talking about.
shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
what a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
are you kidding? i'm not going to tell them.
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
nam?
are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
... taken it for granted? that you and i...
i have not spoken to him...
who's being selfish now? i'm the one getting married. i thought this week was supposed to be about me.
good to see you, diego.
shotgun. suicide. next?
i'm dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel.  with kelly.
aye.
there.  behind the cabinet.  where does it go?
we'd rather not--
mazel tov!
oh my, this is very interesting.  say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
hey, listen, listen.
i guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. for everyone.  for you, and you, and you.
oh, it's all my damn business now, lamar.  investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  he's my suspect.
i don't think i'll tell you.
let's make it at eight.
i got to go.  i'm late.
go on, zack! go for the record!
that woulda been cool.
here? you gotta be kiddin'.
you want out of this place, don't you? don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
where's czech girl?
i wrote that with my heart.
it was an accident!
not as far as the election goes.
<u>no</u>.  i keep getting hit with heads!
wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! i gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
what are you going to do?
nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
gladys -- gladys! look out!
carrying them. they could all be carrying them for what we know.
two.
see you later.  good luck.
well, even to work there would be wonderful. is it beautiful?
you've got to get back on the horse some time.  look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  i know how scary that feels.
hola, chica.
if you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  the whole place would go up.
are you going to put a spell on me?
i can't promise you anything.
what guy?  whose apartment is this, anyway?
i don't get it, that really works?
i never trust a woman who's not blonde. except for my friend serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. that's the whole reason i'm starting the blonde legal defense fund.
i didn't lie to you. i just have trouble keeping track of... time.
no. we were just gonna go someplace or something to...
can't we get out of here?
cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
just gettin' rid of the garbage.
know what i always thought i wanted outta life, erin?  a jaguar.
we were partners.  if it weren't for luther i'd still be hustlin' pinball down at gianelli's.  i don't need anything more than i got.
i know how to do it.  i mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
both would be nice.
nobody's better with evidence. but he has the other thing, too. he doesn't like that part of it...
piano.  guy got away, disappeared into toontown.  nobody ever saw him again.
--christ, they find out i let you have it for the weekend--
where's the rest of the team?
i'm sorry. i don' t want dessert. i don't want promotion. i don't want anything.
just like that?
that's the rub.  i liked wade.  who's ryan?  if they're both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other, how do i choose?  look at my hand, there it goes again.
y'ever heard of a double agent, bill? i'm beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist... after the arrest, 544 camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  now here's another one for you:  what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine?
oh jesus...
mr. president! we're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
i'm wondering why you keep his things.
what?  what do you mean you --
save me!
i was giving you a chance. no matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than prince humperdinck. he could track a falcon on a cloudy day. he can find you
i do.
totally. she came apart like a house of cards. they dropped the charges...
good luck on your mission, 007.
welcome to public school, my friend.
you're gonna get your fix...
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  till then, fuck you.
it's okay, quince.  i understand. you've always meant well and i appreciate that.  sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
oh -- not too much. taking it easy.
oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
up ribbon!
no lloyd. chicks are for fags - i'm not going to do it.
you would?
serves you right. oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. you can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
he should turn that music down. jeremiah's gonna kill him.
oh hi, what can i do for you?
hey, what are you doing?!
may i talk to you alone?
somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
all to pieces!
i will.
okay...
my girlfriend's pregnant.
there's been some trouble downtown.
now - your name is douglas greenwell, yes?
what? fuck you guys, i wanna get out of here.
thanks, jabez -- i really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
nothing.
maybe you didn't hear what i said. i will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, i warn you that...
not staying in here another....
put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
it's like this, wayne. two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. these two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
like rome?
you really are stupid, you know that.
i have two words for you... seek help.
he's gotta still be down here.
don't know.  food banks, welfare, church charity.  they scrape by.
you never asked me, and every time i brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
i'd never tell you to sell those. i bought them for my daughter.
you were sent by herr falkstein, weren't you?
sit down a minute.
i'm through, harry.
you do not look like me.
let it be rain, please let it be --
how was it?
were you there--how do you know?
it's you! i didn't have a picture or nothin' so i had to describe you to the guy. not bad though, huh?
never stopped you before.  and for god's sake stop plucking your hair. someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
everyone knows betty's a wonderful little cook.
well, i haven't come around.
oh yeah?  where's the bed?
a messianic complex is nothing new to octavius. in  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. it must be very lonely.
money makes money, vicki. the foundation runs itself -- i'm extraneous to the process.
we aren't completely stupid.
what?
a coup d'etat! of course, that was foreseen by lenin himself!
what for? to recover that knife you stuck in my back?
will you stop interrupting ?!  you will command the pumps to stop pumping.
call me later, hon.
how's everything at the apartment?
you can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
what?  what's wrong?  what is it?
yeah, see you in hell.
it didn't come up.
it's a surprise.
what?
do you like inez?
oh, i was just examining this rear hatchway.
i always loved that mute broad that chuck heston was shacking up with.
it's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
because john said i mustn't.
yes?
i don't see you crying about my drinking it.
not really.  oh, wait a minute.
you lied to me?
what.
yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. you son-of-a-bitch. you son-of- a
i'm sorry.  look, i'm not real comfortable being here, but...
hey jeff. i'm feelin' so much better.
please... butterfield... i wasn't there.  ask pimm.
there's been an accident.
what about the will?
kate, scott?
ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
inch by inch....
they cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
do they have a show to give it to you?
that's the first thing that ran through my mind when i saw you. i thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
the graf spee...
well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick.
she can't talk to you right now.
i, what are you talking about? i talked to her this morning, and she said...
yeah, i know.  me, too.
yeah, she's a total loser.  c'mon, let's check out the 7-eleven, whatya say?
danny, i'm trying to -- save you.
i saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  i know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
twenty minutes!
i guarantee it'll be worth your while.
no... the closest...
i don't know.  it all happened so fast.  if i'd had a chance to think about it i guess i probably would've been scared but... swear to god, doc, i just don't know.
grand central. you better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
i don't know.  i have to make a stop in vegas.  business to finish.  then maybe i'll head to santa barbara.  i might be able to pick up some work there.
i'd rather sit down for this one, elaine.
i'm a scientist.  i just conducted an experiment.  now i have to write it up.
i didn't hear you.
is it possible...?
...ha.
god, if chet found out he'd...
roger, north island. please advise pending further information. over.
i can see it all now. this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer. you bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
no.  no.  no.  i don't believe it.
we will be fine!
john merrick.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
it's circumstantial.
wait 'til i'm across!
swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. i want to know why he keeps that hidden.
yes.
what do you want me to start with -- the golden gate bridge?
of what?  i'll be unconscious.
that's a real good reason to wind up in 'nam.
hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
let's go look, then. let's go look, then!
i've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. no one's got hurt mind you... and that's the give away.
yeah. i mean, you are my brother and... well i should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. so, i've decided to make it up to you.
one of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
i'm talking about survival. yours, mine, all of it. outside and in. you got to do something for me. staying alive might depend on it. the pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. but their spy's gonna be our spy too. how about it?
no. you've had your chance.
what shall we do?
i have to talk to you, alone, j.j., that's why.
oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? that? 
donovan!
but why risk yourself? hasn't this family suffered enough?
no.
tell me what happened theo.
hmm-mmm.
yes, sir.  his name is vincenzo pentangeli.
oh ... you're a schoolteacher...
i don't know... go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
maybe we are...
get away from that door.
it did give me a chance to meet you again ellen - it's all routine you understand...so where were you?
can't arrest ghosts.  but the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  you're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, miss prescott.
gruner switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to chiang cho.
then you have no use for the sword.
it was all on a russian format, i don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
patrick. turn on the light. he turns on the light.
who are they?
i'm trying.    it doesn't work.
no i haven't.  do you know why pierce is humoring you?
okay, come on down.
doesn't matter.  we're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
man, you're schizoid!
yes. but first of all we'll have a little talk.
louella, please, be reasonable, i understand you have problems with orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
no.  don't tell me that.
sure... tonight. then please stay at my place.
nothing.
bet you did.
yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. she's an amateur, just like del was.
yes, true. but on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...no, lara, believe me; earth is the least of evils. on earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. but with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  he will be fast, he will be virtually invulnerable.
you're doing fine. i won't let anything happen to you, remember?
i don't know. i don't like being out of control.
you don't believe me.
...it's definitely on.
only thing i'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what i should'a done.
that is very probable.  what's your reasoning?
you heard me.
sure. big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
there's no gang in there -- we were the last ones.
not yet.  i had a phlemless morning.  i hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw.
what difference does that make?
now what's that supposed to mean?
it is kind of rough.
what do you mean no i won't? don't presume to tell me what i will and will not do. you don't know me.
then it's worth the journey.
now stop it!
it'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
you have to see the words. try to build a mental picture of the script. imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
a pilates machine?
he said that, too.
i'm not cynical.  can i help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. so you're producing exclusively for grendel records now.  hope you're taking julian for a bundle.
no.  he's - no.
i want to get high off this; bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking all-bran.
prison?
i wish there was something i could do....
obviously a superpredator.  suchimimus. that snout.
j.d.!  just tell me.  i know you're not some schoolboy.  now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
rosemary, honey. good morning. i'm fine.  thanks for remembering.
that inquiry invades my personal life, captain.
yes, captain?  have you anything you wish to say?
he's not here!  tyler's not here anymore!  he's gone away!
i tell you every damned place i go the man is adored!  "general washington!  champion of trenton! savior of the republic!"  and you should hear the way people are deprecating congress!
double-exposures? but they're not-- i was in--
if she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
i was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "if you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." and i'm laughing and then i realize i wear a nametag.
she was about to get married again. she locked me out of the bedroom last night.
yeah ... guy lombardo ...
yeah, but i feel like i fit in for the first time, you know? like i just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
the enterprise. i must check in before your inspection. and you?
no.
wow. you've had quite an evening.
that's why i'm calling, miss price...
what're you going to do, charlie?
huh! you turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
i can get 3 marine corps harriers here in about 12 minutes. they're on maneuvers out of boca chica.
take me to the hotel.
why, buddy, shut your mouth! what an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
miles, i don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
i just know, that's all. i remember you from central.
it's always closed...
let us say i suggest you may be human. your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. if you do so you will die. you will feel an itching -- there... see? now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
you're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
hi.
calling for emilio's macaw. i thought i heard him.
no, i don't.
three words, dear romeo, and good night indeed. if that thy bent of love be honourable, thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, by one that i'll procure to come to thee, where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; and all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world.
mmmmm. well, i'm off. maintain speed and heading, mr. lightoller.
no it's not okay. you have to have this in by tomorrow. did you see the ad we ran sunday?
yes. i am very hungry.
vegetables.
don't you have a maid?
well, you know what they say. human see, human do.
the woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. i think she was crying...
i must find the means to save him, then. i was hoping i could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
five minutes.  maybe six.
that wasn't me.
the date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. is that where you and rachel conduct business.
this check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  that's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
well, sir, plan-r is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
doesn't make sense.
there is one possibility.
of course i remember him. i'm sorry. you were terribly fond of him.
yeah.
have you got an arrest receipt?
only octavius knows for sure.  and last time i spoke to him, he was on the planet whiz-bang.
we got to talk.
i don't know.
speak english! jesus christ we're on television here!
incredible similarity.
you're lucky i am not wasting you.
who is on this committee?
okay so... what's the safest place?
in used currency.  nothing bigger than a fifty.
i hear you.
new king.
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
yeah...
that's impossible! nobody has the right.... you can't do that!... if you don't give me that visa...
if that's what it says.
that's ridiculous.
but what can you do? there's no way now . . .
no thinking. the doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
let's just say it's what's best for the country.
thank goodness.  breaktime.
he spoke to me. you want me to dis him?
that's what we're paid for.
you bet. for five bucks, i'll even throw in the tongue.
we're not sitting here 'til november.  there's a cargo plane coming to devil's cauldron in four days, and i'm putting you on it.
who were they?
really? really!!!
burgers all around.  medium.  rare.  raw.
like shit.
you're a strange man, mr. hutton.
i'm sorry, mrs. mulwray.
buy us some thunderbird, man.
if you don't know what you've seen, why should i?
it is only me.
do me a favour. you don't really expect me to fix kinnear on your say-so?  just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. stroll on.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
i'm amused.
just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
i know you believe that.
just a car.
go home!
thanks, much. good luck with the genital tucking.
you can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
shit, shit, shit what time is it.  hello.  i'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
you said it again!
no need to apologize...
it's your call.
yea!
in a minute, sir.
sam... i...  sandra van ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  she's pushing for suspension...
s'up trent?
of course, i didn't --
well now, ratso, i'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
no, she didn't claire.  but i think you should do the scene.
but, he could've --
come on, panes...
and you wouldn't be.
and we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! we know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  and so you truly need our prayers.
look on the back. what do you see?
you're under arrest. incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
for you, she is beautiful.  for me, there is only my wife!
because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
right.
that was hare's end. ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
take me with you.  there's nothing left for me here.
oh, that's nice...
for what?
i swear to god!...i never saw you before six weeks ago!  our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
that's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of wichita, kansas.
you wouldn't push the guy, would you?
they burn many villages. even walled cities fall to them.
int. gomez's helicopter - day.
well...um...her.
no, it's a very groovy girl.
i'll bet.
the legend goes that you release the power with the power.
they say i'm a habitual hassler. like i fight some. sheeut. they didn't mind so much when i was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. that's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. but if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
yeah, okay. just gimme a minute to freshen up.
leave me, just leave me alone josh.
oh, the wine. i have forgotten the wine.
sorry, boss—
yeah?
you mean aneurysm.
i'm going to wrap it around your throat!
this guy was a bad monkey.  he dabbled in all the black arts, and listen to this prophecy.  just before his head died, his last words were, "death is but a door, time is but a window.  i'll be back."
you know, miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. this might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, massey, but...  i like my women with two boobs.
if you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
you may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in new york city, but down here we take murder seriously.
a manual control on a moving torpedo. this day keeps getting better and better.
i should go to the house, get breakfast.
not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. honest.
nice one.
first night?
i like my horizons narrow.
uh-huh.
that's where valentine's scarpered.
bob, that makes no sense.
please!
no.  no i'm not.
you didn't stop anywhere else?!
relax. it will be fine.
muskets and uniforms and bayonets.
where is my nephew?
i could. you sucked.
war games? thailand? that's not true! how can you believe that? can't you see what they're doing? it's all a lie. we were in da nang, for god's sake. you've got to believe me.
henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
you mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
we got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
no.
let's go.  pull 'em out.
as are we all, and i'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
i might be able to save you.  if i knew enough.
inspector halloran, homicide.  i'm in charge here.
and you don't speak french?
you've never been out of boston.
then stop talking and work faster!
what does charlie think about that?
there's not enough room.
...yes. the day he got out of jail. i allowed him to make ten steps... no more. and bang. two hundred meters. by telescope. that night, i left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for tony.  ...i was 17. then, i never left the city...  and never had another girlfriend...
his letters will keep.
you think he might be missing?
no...
ms. marr!
zat is true, i am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  hey... monet!
let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
chad denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man i ever knew--
you gotta keep clear, tom. the fambly's breakin' up. you *got* to keep clear.
joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
oh, you're very clever. let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
no, daniel -- they are not race horses. they are good old friends of mine. i call 'em constitution and bill of rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. i've got one called missouri compromise, too, and then there's a supreme court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
you scare me, charlie.
it has to be the reality.
yes. i need to return to the observatory immediately. i must continue a critical experiment i was running on the amargosa star.
listen, before you get very used to staying here, i think you and i need to talk about a few things. can i take you to lunch?
you'll get it back.  or one better.
of course, i'm your attorney, i'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
he's at a home out here.
i'm ann millaney's sister.
where the hell are you from, kryton???
mary!
she wouldn't let me.  she's the only reason you're alive.
take that mush out of your mouth!
we know you, we've seen you before like this. is it over - or just beginning?
yes, barbara... barbara...
you have the right to say "no." and i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant. and if i don't want to go through all that trouble, i could just take you in on suspicion.
and now....
a dress.
well, now, mister, that sounds all right. but--
tommy jarvis.  we gotta do something.  he's even more powerful now that...
what do you mean?
oh!  come back!  don't go without me! please come back!
yeah, i guess.
look at those walls up ahead!
the captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from earth to take home. the police came and shot at us. one of the people from my ship was killed.
abc.
hmm.  pretty good.
yes, ma.
i can see that. sure.
you won't hear that from hooks. because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. he can't change the charge.
but i can heat some up for you if you'd like.
they gonna rush us?
no! arrgh!
mine?
call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
go ahead. open the fuckin things. you should each find fifteen hundred --
archibald dobbs; certified public accountant.  but, that's all we got.
well, i mean... you know, i gotta ask you. that's a lot of money. you're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. i mean...
first big night of liberty and no date?  you're pathetic, wickwire.
we must have alliance with england to prevail here. you achieved that! you saved your family, increased your lands! in time you will have all the power in scotland!... yet you grieve.
yeah.
only the agency of servants.
does that mean i'm in?
yeah. to get the hell off this farm.
yes...
he's pretty... remarkable.
she's coming.
yes.
you're not listening, mother.
he'll be really mad.
uh, i'll try...
if you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
but you wasn't a preacher. a girl was just a girl to you. but to me they was holy vessels. i was savin' their souls.  i ast myself--what *is* this call, the holy sperit? maybe *that's* love. why, i love everybody so much i'm fit to bust sometimes!  so maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. there's just what people do. some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. but that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
there's a certain key floating around the office -- from kirkeby to vanderhof to eichelberger to dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
jack.
what's wrong with her.
just remember the needle in the haystack.
so what do we do?
i don't want to be a fool!... i want to look them in the eye and say, i know!
you're taking mom out tonight?
ah, the mafia, the cops; do i know how to party or what?
two hundred pounds?
hold me, jezzie. hold me.
pretty much.
no.  i mean...  that isnít necessary.
it's ok...
gee... what makes you say that?
<u>lure</u> him. 
it's only 7:30.
i don't want to play.
eleven.
who is she?
yes sir.
keep your voice down.  i'm taking you and your brother out of here.
they're coming in here, aren't they?
oh, yeah.
yes.
you should see little montel play. little montel is the next maradona.
oh, good, my way. thank you, vizzini.  which way is my way?
that's a good idea. unfortunately most of them have been executed.
ever seen an uncut diamond, studs? they look like plain old rocks.
you went out this morning and bought a gun.
yes.
well.
shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  maybe a bottle of wine...?
yes, i believe you could.  how free is your schedule this afternoon?
i've got to play it rough with them. if they know anything, i'm gonna know it.
george is going to open a shop.
is that a threat?
probably.
studs.  hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  i was just thinkin' about you.
why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when i went up.
hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  that's some big shoes to fill.
yes it does.
he using her.
how much?
i left like an hour ago.
you went to school with these people.
i've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
for five hundred, what do i get?
right you are, governor!
who told you about this?
jack.
about 60 feet, admiral.
because you hate me.  because you had to be here, when mom died.  because you had to do it alone.  well, don't you think if i'd known... i'd've been here too.  i'd have been here...
-- i give you money, i give you a paycheck. your sales suck, don. i give, i give. when i find you, when i meet you, what? i put you on the billboard, i put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of solomon and solomon electronic, quiz kid donnie smith from the game show --
well -- well i'm just back. and -- i must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
you see, maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
finland is a country.
i'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
you missed him? you didn't...?
hello, lacy. can anybody break a twenty? the cabbie didn't have any change.
wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  and <u>you</u> get a second chance!
that's why she hates me. that's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
oh, are you kidding, man? she hates her.
what mission?
i don't have one.
check!
i wanna go home now.
but, nick... hey, i mean, where would a guy like merle get money like this?
he's just playing big brother.
there's something very familiar about this painting.
do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"dear senator smith, i would like to come to your boy's camp and i shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." oh, isn't that wonderful. look and he signs it. "yours truly, stinky moore." isn't that marvelous?  say--have i got some paper here?
for god's sake, forget the money! i'm going crazy! i'm a walking anachronism. i'm a puddle of deja i'm worried about my kids, scott must be scared to death, i think my daughter's doing drugs again. i can't have any fun here, i don't have that innocence any more. i can't keep all this in anymore. i feel like i'm going to explode.
of course. wow... you look extremely beautiful.
no, sir.
well, looks like we done it this time awright!
she says she wants to mmph!
you'll just have to have faith.
play it for us, please.
cut it out, will ya...
i have something to tell you. but i must talk to you alone.
the fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means i haven't done it right...  is that correct? i haven't done it right?
you're missing most of your life, jim, and you don't even know it. the kids are missing out too.  it's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. you had sex last night and you feel guilty.
it's all right, sheriff.
i know right. it was kinda weak. that's cause will kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. the script was written by some new guy. he wrote arlington street.
what was that you said he was?
i'm 53, starling. if i found jimmy hoffa on national tv, i'd still have to retire in two years. it's not a consideration. but you are...  you've done enough. if i keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. cost you six months, at least. i can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  now's your chance, starling. go back to class. leave bill to me.
find you?
hi.
i want that cat.  i'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
i am going to call the police now.
no. you saved me from this fanatic. maybe i can pay you back.
i tried cheerios this morning. he didn't even get up. maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
captain dwyer.  technically.
a direct one.
whoopie fucking doo.
please, mom.  at least consider it. you should get away.  you shouldn't be alone now....
why ain't they more like it?
are you married?
that's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
destroy it?
it was hot, yes.
what do you want with old man faz?
oh, is this...?  god. first one of these i haven't been in for a long time.
dignan, it's --
i've done this.  i've had to do this.
but there is a bright side though. if you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
shit.
pay the good man.  don't you close soon?
excited.
yeah, sure.  i'm corky.
if i didn't i wouldn't be here!  i've got it all itemized. 
i can safely say that michael myers is now in your hands.
yes, where would you go?
you mean there's mre than one?
i don't pretend i came over on the mayflower--
think about it -- but don't take too long because i'm out of time. if you change your mind, this is where i'll be.
but you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
yes. he has a long journey ahead.
do you sing and dance?
you work too hard, you know that?
it's a piece.
all right. the wallaces leave at seven.
that's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. you probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. you were dead wrong. we're only interested in one thing: can you tell a story, bart?  can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? is that more than one thing? okay.  the point is, i run this dump and i don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. why do i run it? i've got horse-sense, goddamnit. showmanship. and also, and i hope lou told you this, i bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. did you tell him that, lou? and i don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. coffee?
i really gotta pee.
good point.
yes you can....
okay.
be it so ordered. the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  this hearing is adjourned.
oh - okay, we ain't done with this... those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  we're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  i'm gonna visit my mom!
well, it looks like you're a little late.
great.  well, i'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
she died in a car accident.
what happened here?
and now you're using blade to exact your revenge?
it is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
some guy called to let him know the frenchman who’d called the night before he left london was in l.a. looking to kill him. he did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
then show me who you are.
hello, eve.
oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?

sera...
you don't know how i've compromised my standards.
now, buckaroo banzai?
oh, leave off!!!
i think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
damn you, sir!  god damn you to hell!
what? no. i'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
it was the husband. the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
ohhhhhhhhh, how i hate you.
i'll buy her a less expensive dress, so i can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
your threats amuse me, captain chekov. what consequences did you have in mind?
something wrong with the stairs?
mission accomplished.
just a second.
i find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  anyway, i've had my fill of life on the ground. after spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  i find i've had quite enough of planet earth.
i'm a pilot, will. this is where i belong.
lots of my clients are rich guys... they like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
i'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. forget caitlin bree. you've been with veronica for how long now?
...ya gave dipper my locker.
-- i have a feeling you're going to tell me.
why are you telling this to me?
why didn't you come to me yesterday, mozart? this is a most painful situation. yesterday i could have helped you. today, i can't.
jesus, i hope i'm not interrupting you again. i heard you walking around in here.  figured i'd drop by.
yeah, but i fucked up. you can take it. really.
yes it is.
evidence.  of a homicide.
when did you write it?
harry, what --
shhh!  this way!
yeah.

would you say that again?
something like that.
yes.
call them.  trust me.
where are you from.
like della.
that's it.
no, you're not in trouble.  i'm interested in a murder.
i don't need them anymore. where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
that'll be the day!...let's ride.
hello, neo.  do you know who this is?
please. because i love you.  he stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. she turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. he watches her go and starts to move after her. then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  and then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
i decided not to - i'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
that... sawing and hammering.
it's his show for now.  look, you want to get some dinner?  inter- agency cooperation and all?
them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
i'm trying!
you're gonna sing? do you sing? well, no, it isn't  no kidding?  this is my first time. oh, really? where? i'd like to come.  oh, no, no, no, no, no! no, i'm interested!
i need you for an assignment the chief's given me the go-ahead on. a duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  you'll be working out of homicide.
no.
what's he up to?
oh really?
who the hell is this!?
no.  that's stupid.
you like to play games, don't you, peter?
that's right, me.
when you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  but you shouldn't think about it too much.  the trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
that's been noted.  but where does it lead us?  unless you have something more to add.
quaffable but far from transcendent.
you got my back.
and tell him not to delay.
just a little--you know.
no, really.  i've never met anyone like her before.  this is it.
well, not yet. it's still in the planning stages.
no, it wasn't...you mighta said you loved me...you mighta asked me to wait...at least that'd have been something...
helena, please.  this is out of your hands.
not yet.
tide doesn't turn for three hours.
<u>forgiveness?</u>  for <u>what</u>, exactly?
yes?
you have been hearing the sordid side then.
you know what i mean. you're keeping her there against her will.
right.
sire, i --
what?
lingerie.
and he still sits there?
dead.
fuck you!  i'm tired of your goddam accusations!  if you want to arrest me go ahead!  otherwise back off.
for christ's sake get him!
we'll see about that.
when i was a kid... i was never allowed up here...
will you stay here for the night? you can leave in the morning. that's when my parents get back and --
it doesn't matter!  just get out of the goddamn building...
okay, but i don't want to miss him.
doucet killed my partner.
we in radio contact with anybody up there?
subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, osborne?
what do you have in mind?
i'm on my way with eddie.  ludwig's. 63rd and madison.  the suspects might be there already.
no, i guess i'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
well...uh...they, y'know, uh... they had nicknames.
you're burned out.
can you follow them?
believe me, i'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. but it's not in the cards, partner.
this money is evidence.
never made so much money in my life. but my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  i did get to argue a case before the supreme court.
there's a lovely inn just down --
oh mark.  it's ok.  it's ok.

ni!  ni!  ni ... peng ... nee ... wum!
you know where you're taking me. you know what she'll do. just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
there must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
this is the police lock-up.  we're police.  how can we steal from ourselves?
i have no idea what kind of girl i am.
you do not!
i don't know.
very good.
is there something more we should know about this suspect, sir?  i mean besides what's on his sheet.
i don't like things that make you cry.
and that is my last word on the matter.
yes, thank you.
peace of mind.
good question.
this new learning amazes me, sir bedevere.  explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
what's 'incidentals?'
you've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  it's only fitting you give one af us away.

i'm writing a book on kite construction. what did you want to talk about?
sir, various drawings, done by dr. lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  i have to ask if you've placed those bids.
yes.
someone who smokes french cigarettes.
all you have to do is ask.  the quarterback is saying they'll run the old statue of liberty. their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
well, maybe he has nice friends.
i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing.
the bitch shot me, is what happened.

you’re judging me?! oh, that’s a good one. you’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. but you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? the man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
there are no commercial lanes out here.  face it, we're out of range.

no, it's not.
yeah.
you're crazy.

last one to the midnight star buys.
i'm not sure.
yes -- oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
who cares? who cares?
how are the kids?
no thanks.
who would want to do such a thing as that?
it wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that i totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. when we got out of the stairwell, i remember thinking, 'oh my god. this might work.' but mickey knew it would work all along. there wasn't any doubt in his mind. it's not like there was and he just didn't show it. he knew it would work.
don't fret, benjie, it's --
oh, right.
here.
ah-hh, no.
mary janes, mom.  you promised.
i think i forgot the tent.
nick, the ice is --
hello, bob.
maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! geezus brian!

i called my dad.

we're in the shitter, man!  pick your poison.  maybe he's in there to finish the job.  maybe he's working for wombosi.  maybe they want to go on tv together.  every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
i've had worse.
now, now, now!  it's all right, governor.

i'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  all we can do now is batten down and ride it out. if things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
a bit rapidly. i don't care what you say about david, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
exaggerate.
you bet i do.  high tide comes right up to this road.

yes, i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer.
it came from your great, great, great grandmother, isabelle tourez, who lived in paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  the ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
if that's true, what about nomak?  he's been alive longer than the others.
but you call this room the "temple".
plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. people breed like chickens.
i'm saying things got out of hand.  maybe they did take advantage of her!.  maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  no charges were brought.  and the bottom line is, rina reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  you wanna get ahead in hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, i cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.

no, you don't, jim.  'cause if i close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  and my guys don't have a week for a feeb bureaucratic process.  every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  so, right here, right now, they're back in or i pull them out and close you down.  what's it going to be?
i doubt it! come on, ken.
this stuff is so sticky.
right, let's go.  and keep the compliments to yourself. i don't like them.
i see what you mean.

you don't say.
i don't have time, sark. and neither do you. end of line.

okay, fireman.
it's not so rare. he grew up on our street. he's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
why didn't you give a warning signal?
champagne and a tin of caviar.
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a princeton student.  he gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
really?
his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. louisa was henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. four or five years go by, and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with louisa. i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. they're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. i guarantee it ... so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. and the poor girl never came back.
well, you gotta understand, i'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
yes.
look, colonel.  i've got to talk to somebody at air command.
does this mean what i think it means?
it's ok.  it's ok.
that's not what i meant, dignan.
you know what i want.  you know why i need you.
hey, don't worry about it. your daughter's around. we'll find her in a couple days.
if i break it they can take it out of my pay.
oh, go fly a kite.
what was it about her that disturbed you so, billy?
quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
she'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  i pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  wanted to keep it a secret.
well, but missus creed! it ain't quite that way, deah!
sure.
my personality's showing again. should i leave?
i don't like that story.
no. i don't think so.
get away from me!
very good.  now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
a spacial entity.  an organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
what do you mean?
i can't blame the ocean--it's you.
now where's she goin'? --
what do you get for winning?
fellas, say goodbye to chuck sherman, the boy.  i am now a man.
well i don't know what can be done, mr. ruby, because i don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
yeah.
yes, sir!
you want 'em?
the first time i've been grateful for coit tower.
wait!  stop!  don't give them the satisfaction.  i know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! are you going to throw it all away now??
i don't know, i'll get her a card or something.
no.
i don't understand.
to not do that.  to not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
you're late for breakfast.
yo, rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
what is?
look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the comoros.  how much you got saved?
please...
i had to inspect the merchandise first.
yep.  he really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  musta gone 450 feet...damn...
an oldsmobile silhouette.
that's nice. are you drunk?
twelve years younger.
you'd have to start immediately.
we're very upset with her.  get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call l.a.  i want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  of their <u>tits</u>.
christ... shu is innocent.
what if you can't make yourself happy? what if everything falls apart?
what's he care about?
don't worry.  she's just a fan for my literary output.
please... wait.
okay, shorty... see you in the morning... i'm going to have a little -- word with willie.
an embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? you think i'm dirt, if i'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, mr. industrial magnate preysing.
i got back today. you can't imagine the excuses i had to make up to be here...
no.
you're just an experiment, freako!
if it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control i had. trevor, i never date patients.
working whores with squad two.
you can't fit in here -- i can't fit in there. according to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
i think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
i know you're a good boy, clark. no mother could ask for better. it's just that...
christ, i don't want to see her take a fall.  she thinks i do, but...
right.  i'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
is there anything more i could --
yeah, ma, i love him awful.
hey!  virgil!  my god!  morgan!  hey, boy!  you look great!  both of you!
like, uh...?
i think so.
this is the last thing she'll ever write. she'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
ohhh. you're in therapy too, marty?
i don't blame you for getting angry. you are in a frustrating situation. you must be patient though.  trust me completely.  i'm here to help.
my husband's dead, isn't he?
that building?
...never doubt what you are doing.
yes, daddy.
stop him, clark!
i want you to leave. then maybe...
came back three days ago.
your father is proud of you.
i'm sorry.
rich, comic book freaks.
dad--if my curveball is hanging, god ain't gonna help me.
let's take a look at the body.
no.
what?
where you know amanda from?
did one of those things grow inside her?
i'll drink to that.
it's private.  go away.
we did what we had to do. tommy don't forget. sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if tommy don't die.
sleaze to peddle.
this is... really a shock...
weed lowers the body temperature.  i read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
it will... take me from <u>you</u>...
no, no ... come on in.
what?!
bullshit. that boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. we found her. she's ours.
we haven't even begun tea yet.
i mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  it's bad enough i have to get old, but doin' it with darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  i mean, i don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
that doesn't sound normal.
i'll destroy whatever's in the case.
so whattya say, kid?  you in or out?
what do you suggest, lieutenant? opening fire won't retrieve the captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
what's average?
put your hand down. i don't high five.
they asked.
this little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  you are a bad man!
i'm not... easy.
oh. well, yes.
kkinsa! open the doors!
it's nice.
then you'll understand my quest.  an ogre named blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  the world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  unless i return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
i'll fill page after page, i promise.
no, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how i would know somebody like you...
i wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
edmunds, do you have a 20 on norman?
i know.  i'm sorry.
like i said; so?
sure witt! now art thou sociable, now art thou romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
yeah, a good political solution.
'... it's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
well...  well... these birds attacked us.
i came to see merle.
i bet you try on my coffin some day -- i hope it "fits just perfect."
but damn if he don't look like a fat old dragline.
hot chocolate.
it'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. nice work, daddy.
it's not good, ben - i'm sure you can feel it.
gabe?  what are you doing ... ?
i'm his pimp. he left with the dancers, didn't he?
i guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
yes--
i loved her for how good she made me feel, and i hated her for how good she made me feel. and at that time, i tended to express my feelings non- verbally. i couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
we don't have time!
i'm going to the senior dance.
jesus.
my husband will be back quite late.
nothin'. salvy was out of line. he was drunk or somethin', i dunno. anyway, the windup was i gave him a beatin'. tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. it's all forgotten about.
thank you, my love.                                         ]
sell the movie rights.  we're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
coop, where are you...
it's all right.  now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  we'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
they will love it every place.  read it.  read the scene just before she has him killed!
no, i figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. we should have that floor done in a day or so.
very well. i'll wager a dinner.
nancy!
communion.
i'm not hungry.
how we gonna sleep? we only got a few hours til dinner.
what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for? shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
danny, come on over here.
frankly, i'm shocked.  marvin acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy.  maybe freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  someone to bring them to him.
you have got to be joking?
no . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. love like there has never been in a play.  i will have love or i will end my days as a . . .
it was very silly.... i would be ashamed to wear it here.
cat.
no, no!
don't lose any sleep over it. i wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
who's "eleanor?"
oh, uh, i mean, uh, ass-goblin...
i never said that. it was just that boy--
you'll always be older than me, father.
i want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so i can get out of this city.
who? who is?
no, mikhi, i wouldn't.  since i won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, english will do nicely.
i beg your pardon?
come on, go back there? i never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
no ... a little deficit won't hurt. jesus, they're serious.  why're we stopping?
nice to meet you, mr. ullman.
i'll get wally to show me sometime then.
me first?
quite a little shopping spree. how do you spend six figures in less than six hours? oh, never mind i've seen it before. i've seen everything.
she's a little sad, is all.
now i know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
it's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
not eating like you used to, that's what.
what?
i love michael.  michael!!
you're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
at the time, i thought, i got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  i can't afford to lose my job.  i told myself i was being honorable.  but there's nothing honorable in what i did.  maybe that's why they picked me for the job. maybe they knew what kind of man i was.
that's perfectly clear.
once the orders have been given, plan-r requires any new orders to be received on the crm-114 in the aircraft.  but the crm-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
who?
i don't think, he can't...
jesus!
i'm criswell.  i know all.
meg's lasagna. good eats, reilly. c'mon.
suppose our theorizing is correct? then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
you don't know?
i lie to my parents every day. and every night.
no, i want the nsa to get caught spying on albert.
christ!
gracious even in defeat. how vaguely disappointing. when all this could have been ours together.
uh, what?
she might have used an alias. mary crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
yes.
and let's put this together.  okay? shel?  say okay.
get in bed.
he's alright, i guess. i hope. they're doing tests, that's why i'm home from school. i was over at the hospital this morning and i was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind vista, i found an ear.
the least we can do is leave him another door jam.
what? come on. she's got a good thing with victor --
i don't understand you.
changed?
that's from her -- that woman.
that's okay. it's not really my business. i have wondered though. why was it? was it like a nervous breakdown?
no--he's probably one of the "here's how."  take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
got it?
i'll give you anything you want. anything!  please!
a lot's happened since last weekend.
that's out of the question. no one is going to genesis!
no. i want to have a baby. i have to have a baby.
and his track record, that don't count? look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
i'm cooking' up. there is a silence.
you mean she's dead?
yes.  he brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
bob?
the ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. the abdominal aorta. what a gusher. had a cup on his belt, so i used it to catch a little run-off. metallic taste to it, human blood. coppery. but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. course, that's more for winter. summertime, i take mine straight.
look, i...
the wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
heavy, heavy duty. taku wakan. wanagi spirits. it's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. still don't. some of the old people say crazy horse is buried back there. we have to go ray. together. like his vision.
thanks for the ride.
hi, mr. ansel.  hi, jessica, mason...
counsel approach the bench.
it's hazy...it's got him! stay here and don't let him out.  i'm going to get the doc.
-- in what sense?
i hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
who came?
oh, come on dad...
at least she isn't drinking.  did you notice?
father, tell me what happened at fort wilderness?
oh thank god, i thought i was the only one.
oh, untrue, jeffster. i think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where i had fucked two girls.
you gonna miss your bus.
thank you so much. merci. it's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
if we move in a group, we are one target. if we scatter, they can't get us all.
egyptian mail. morning edition.  run!
well if i don't who will?
yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but i decided ... i'd like to be here for you.  here, mom.  you can have it back.  thanks, though.
truman used it all the time.
under <u>water</u>?
who are you guys?
we'll have more fun in detroit.
naw, that's some stupid shit.  now you know how i got that name.
i like you, joey.  you ask all the right questions.  there is something we can do but it will require great courage.
dad'd be proud --
well... yeah - okay.
oh, man, i've been trying to call you.
least he never called me that. with me, it was always "high-strung." "my bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." or "tightly wound," that was another one. you seeing anyone?
what's to think about?
tell ms. kramer what your daddy does.
run to the nearest phone and call the police.
please... kill...
not that one!
what's that go to do with...i've gone out with a, with jewish women. why?
be brave!  otho take care!  onward!
well, they fucked it up.
it's the influence of television. yeah, now marshall mcluhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  a hot medium... as opposed to a...
i guess it isn't.
gimme the address. i'm gonna go. we're going to need her.
i don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
nerves.
oh?
which leads us to...
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
sort of.  i'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. maybe i can get my money back.
that she was unconscious, yes!  so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
i'm checking on that.  i think we should meet thursday night at nine to talk about it.
somebody...
well, what was left of him.
lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
she was in the theater?  when? where?
...the solution presents itself.
as long as you keep overpaying me, i'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
i will do it.
like what?
are you just making that up to make me feel better?
talk not to me, for ill not speak a word. do as thou wilt for i have done with thee.
he knew nothing. he just didn't care.
without question?  he only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  what curve are you marking on, doctor?
well, i guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. he's jealous and worried.
yeah... she's okay, though.
why is that?
that day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
i'm not!!
i ain't getting shit.
you got it made, kid.  fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -

i could carve a better man out of a banana!
i don't know, sir.
we didn't make a dime.
didn't you forget something?
'go! go! go!'
yeah well fuck you! you just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
yes well...  you are a credit card holder, are you not?
i sent a female in. the room in question was rented by an anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
no.
yikes.
i don't need any proof.
i begged him not to go. and he did.
yeah... so, listen-you drive?

well get along with this one.  go ahead of us.  don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
what happened to title dictates behavior?
twelve seventy-five from the clarence? the son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  but he got you here.
i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
it's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
embolism in her brain. yesterday.
it's geoffrey under this.
yes.
another precedent gone. this has been a very interesting evening. i'll call you a cab. gasoline rationing, time of night.
they're gonna hafta take their chances.
do it!
so what?
don't worry. she's bound to be upset.
she's got information inside of her.  i need you to get it out.
the grave. somebody close?
and i'll tell the child protective services about your kiddie porn endeavors. one step closer and i'll shove this up your ass!
you know, i could just as well go without seeing him today.
dwayne?
it's for men.
nothing you can say will upset me.
they're still there!
that was three times you promised.
rowan...
what?
i don't know.  i hadn't thought it out that far.
how much do you make a week, niki?
i'm just setting my boundaries.
in case they try to kill us. i don't know, what do you want me to say?
will you be ok now? i've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. i've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
i like that. aren't we supposed to wish on it?
...but the president wonders about the possible albanian backlash...
cause fuck him, that's why.
you're insane.
then don't waste time talking to me.
come on, i'll show you around.
it amazes me how little you know yourself.
now get this, gallagher - smith. that's the name.
what's that got to do with it?
slow down.
that's little egotistical.
feel like practicing?
you mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
just wanted ta say hello.
say hi to zoe.
what do you get if you finish?
waitaminit, dudes! i got it! maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
jeanne, listen to me very carefully. we are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  we do so in the name of our holy mother church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  but we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  so now... will you please recite our lord's prayer?
husband?
congratulations, mrs. kramer. you have just rewritten matrimonial law.  you were both divorced, mrs. kramer.
a lot? i mean, a whole lot?
good idea!
we're what!?
alright, cut, cut, cut.
about a year and a half.
think he still thinks about her. but not like then. then was an obsession.
bud fox, i look at a hundred ideas a day. i choose one.
no.
it's a tough proposition, andy. you, you know, if i did it, i'd have to run it my way.
yes... it's a test.
-- 'cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and i knew --
he was cute though.
look -- elaine robinson and i do not get along.
no.  not actually.
help! i mean  --  i can't stop saying it. silly, isn't it  -  there's nothing to worry about. help! see.
evan. he's a mucky-muck union official from massachusetts. you're lucky.
told ya, didn't i?
i always check the batteries.
i don't know.  i, uh -- i frankly don't even want to talk about it.
'but i say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
my boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when i tell him...
johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
yeah.
what time is it?
thank god he was born an orphan. it would have killed his parents.
that's good... who?
oh.  sorry.
thank you.
yeah? i have a saying too, lex. it goes, "catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." we're going this time and that's all there is to it.
the point is the killer always goes, may i speak to starsky? he says his name.
yeah, but let's stay on one subject. whoever that person is is going to be famous. they'll be able to get whatever they want. they'll ... trust me, this is my business.
that's only because you don't know where to go.  you like hiking?  fishing?  sailing?  what do you like?
lillian says it once a week. `why doesn't he come live with us?'
yes, sir. you can't be too careful.
i'm looking at new cars.
what’s that? a word?
this is not worth eight pounds, mrs. clifton.
wagner...
let's get out of here...
i don't know... but it does.
look at you, not even breaking a sweat. you're cool, boy.  you're cool.
don't worry about it.
ya hear, joey? she thinks this face is cute? hey, whatcha doin' now? you wanna go for a ride?
victor, are you feeling alright?
well, if you don't know i can't tell you.
wife?!
i don't know. i had no food or water. it was very cold. i thought - if i can even save just one... but he got so heavy. so heavy...
i know that.
oh...
pretty straightforward, but i don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
the train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  would you like to hear the silver lining?  check that, gold.  i've been working with john bontecou all along.  we had a game plan -- acquire parrish communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  i set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
yeah.
well -- he died on a sunday and i have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels friday afternoon.
boyfriend?
we offer female wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. tipping is permitted. we accept bank americard, master charge and american express.
what's that, then?
but how did you get here? what are you doing here?
that's when you went to the orphanage...
right.
hmm. it's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
i want you to go right away, i think that's best. i also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
i don't know what i've done.
what the hell is going on here?
not all.  radio is out.  but our field phones are okay so far.
you don't have any idea what you're talking about. these people bust their ass. this is a hard job.
i'm sure starfleet would approve, sir.
hey pal, i got a mortgage, all right? i got two kids. i got a wife. besides, he made the deal. there's no shame in it.
absolutely not.  a good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  if you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
you don't have to remember to be hungry.
talent is no holy shield. von richtofen was killed by a farm boy. instincts are not enough. do it our way. we've worked these things out. the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    why do you have to do everything the hard way?
yes. sure. it was his idea. *i* should have been the one to think of it--
sent it.
nobody.
i was trying to tell you... it's a game.
ain't you goin' to record it?
thank you, sergeant.
what do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
don't be a fool. you can't get away.
do you think this will come in my time?
yeah.
relax donald, relax.  they're scientists.  they ought to be curious.
you certain?
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. we thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
'night.
yes, okay, exactement!
oh, please...
salzburg.  we were just talking about salzburg.  if you've come from my friend the fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. because i've got good news for him. i'm done with vienna. it's over, finished, done with! done with! done with!
you're a good mother.
dancing?
i'm not. but you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
well, i just...
pimm's dead.  jennifer desiderio's disappeared...
what happened?
i can't go all the way down south.
no, victor, no.
where's my dress? i have to go home.
what if they serve soup?
what?
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new tangiers.
they're discussing it.
huh?
you got it bad.
i mean, frank marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. this time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in antwerp.
no.
melvin...
what do you mean? who can buy this kind of equipment.
don't patronize me!  you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
excuse me?
yeah. come on—we're stopping here for the night.
that must make it tough.
that thought makes me feel awful.
okay - you remember joe—
security's locking down the elevators.
ok, ok.  you gonna make me something to eat at least?
i'm going to buy a toy.  i worked very, very hard and i think i deserve a toy.
it happens to this piece of shit...
are you busting my chops or what?
i didn't know mr. reed had been married before.
you know that we checked the two ao-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
i don't know -- don't have any idea -- i'm just the night man --
right now your big friend at the diplomat is bleeding fast, martin. he might still possibly survive if attended to soon. and he did cooperate.
not these people!  they are ruthless!
i'm not breathing right.
you should shit or get off the pot.
yeah.
army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  back home, we go out squirrel huntin', i walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
do i have to?  who's the little girl?
dmitri hired him!  he's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  he was stalking you when i dropped you off.  i don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
that's not what i'm going to do.  good!
all right. thank god. alan stayed awake, at least.
i could subpoena him if i had a week.
you, me and harry?
they had a rough life. your father was a bouncer. your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. there was no place for a baby.
i apologize, barton.
i...i...we need cash, james.
you bastard! you tortured him. you tortured him, you bastard. where is he?
he stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
because...
doctor?  what could be wrong wit' you?
no worries ...
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
debbie's marrying rick.
hang on a second.
you must come from pretty far south.
 all right.  one more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
just smile again and be reasonable.  i'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
thank you...
love is funny.
boy, rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
it is not enough to have men of science. we scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. we must get important men from every field. educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
what?
not with this disk. i'm going to check on the beam connection, yori. you two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
there's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. does that count?
a million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
seriously? it's a great idea.
i was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at camp crystal lake. besides yourself.
i was at a cocktail party.  very trendy.  andrew was in chicago on business.  he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  he looked so helpless.
that's why we're here, sheriff cable. where's the body?
well, if i did i certainly wouldn't say it to you!
hey, darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
eleven. in the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
i know.
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for?  he was dino's boy, not mine.  he shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  nobody knows.
why what?
you tell me.
good. very good. tibet is a great country. a wonderful history. long ago, you even conquered part of china. but now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. in twenty years time you could be ahead of us. then it will be your turn to help china.
they still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
what?
he told me my share was twenty-five.
who?
it's garbage.
oh, no. sometimes i have dinner with ed sullivan, sometimes with dinah shore or perry como -- the other night i had dinner with mae west -- of course, she was much younger then.  cheers.
no, he didn't.
what time does the show go on?
you son-of-a-bitch.  how do you stop it?
why not me?
say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
a miracle? this is modern times! there ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
i couldn't do it. not to you.
no thanks.  i'd like to break away--
yeah.  i just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to england, and i wanted to tell you that i thought your speech was really incredible.
i didn't follow you.
what happened to your eye?
because you're in trouble.
he was trying to kill me, not you.
what?  running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
evan twombley, the union boss who got shot. somebody murdered him.
he'll not escape me.
promise me again...
you believe me don't cha?
stop.
ohhh. what's hari-kari?
don't you worry about that.
yes. i like to watch.
it's only temporary. on a freelance basis.
i, actually yes.
who the hell would you call?
god.
excuse me?
how come?
i'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
they're in the basement.
breakfast ... ah! ... come along friends, ma stone's a cook this side of heaven.
yes.
yes, that's very pretty. i heard a story once. as a matter of fact, i've heard a lot of stories in my time. they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "mister, i met a man once when i was a kid," it'd always begin. huh. i guess neither one of our stories was very funny. tell me, who was it you left me for? was it laszlo, or were there others in between? or aren't you the kind that tells?
you're crazy. i can't--i can't-no. no.
do me a favor, al.
partnership?
if you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
in a second.
it's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 dna memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..this one has 200,000.
you didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. i want to sneak in tonight. it's friday, do you have a date tonight?
"applicant?"
maybe not.
gee, thanks, lou.
do you need a secretary?
jesus, lenny.
ray, think about how she looked when you married her. think about how happy you were. don't lose that, man. don't give up everything.
mm-hm.
so does elliot.
that lunch was the worst, huh.
jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
i can't be a burden, especially now.  i know i'll get used to things.  i guess i wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  upstate, it was a completely different environment.  i don't know if david told you, but i teach fifth grade, or did.
so, i don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
you really are one dumb asshole.
it's just been empty a while.
we can't.
okay, number 23's full.
where's scully?!
mark this, come what will of it, i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan.  i'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. i'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
that's right... take one of these.
time!
a deer?
i am serious.
well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? thanks for your help.
i really do. for your own safety.
she'll come, pard. a rich socialite oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
susie?  i called her myself the day after he died.  i thought maybe somebody ought to...  she couldn't even come to the 'phone.
rogue?
i'm not stitching nikes in panama! ... bedwetter!
it's my day off.
mr. nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, captain.
no sir! but you have to be ready.
nonsense- samuel would have done something. 
here we go!
jerry's visits to your office. why do you tolerate them?  why him?
you're damaged.
one night i will get the perfect photograph.
it is day, of course, freya.
it was perfect.
what the heck're you talkin' about? let's just finish up this deal here -
you need to get out more.
yes, your majesty.
i don't know.
you're not going to blame this on castro, are you?
you know i can't talk about that.
i can' take you to a hospital.
no hard feelings, okay? it's a small place, and i can't get my work done with you around.
mccone's been notified and is coming back from the west coast. carter's here, though.
and i'd take it out on him.
why?
was that you?
then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
the stay-puft marshmallow man!  he was on all the packages we used to buy when i was a kid.  we used to roast stay-puft marshmallows at camp waconda!
the doctors.
john wayne... listen, nick --
come on!
think he's keeping track of his creation?
big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
no--
i was speaking of earth men. i meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
why?
mom, just give me five more minutes. just five minutes, okay?
don't do that. 
yes.
well, i suppose we could use another good public feud...
that viper has envenomed the water. no animal will drink here now.
goddamn geek!
it's my entire baseball collection. it's yours now.
a shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
that's what i hear.  don't matter.  girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
in a pasha's harem, majesty. a seraglio.
looking for you? yes.
i don't give a fuck about the sex. most men'll fuck a lamppost. he's just a miserable zombie. is that the way you feel now? is that what's happened to you?
she doesn't know what she wants. she's never had a stable life.
what about your girlfriend? you don't think she'll mind?
would i get paid?
what will happen?
milo?
do me a favour.
oh really?
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
who's that?  zimmermann's money-man?
what happened?
do you know where that term comes from? in the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
where do you live?
oh really. then why is he called jake. why don't you come clean and call him jack.  there's no hope in it.
well, there we're in a gray area.
it's a fire fight.
what's the matter?
martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the church, not the crown... least of all me.
no, no... it was very... er, nice.
she's beautiful.  look at her. henry, look at her.
place the checks properly. that's the way you do it.
not our kind of people, you understand.
oh god...oh god...
look, bodhi man.  people are dead. the ride is over.
reverend mother, on behalf of the sisters, i'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine's.
to let it dry.
no.  so what time do you need?  i love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  i'd like to be a part of it -- i think i deserve that!  so what do you need to figure out alone!?
thanks.
his criminal career has officially come to a close ...
almost as much as he loves himself.
uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
"dracula."
well, let's hit that party.
karen...  ... isn't it awful, i'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
he has a reputation for being tough.
tim!
thank you very much.  i always try my best.
why not?
who are you, friend?
kool-aid!? but who'd would want to -
i found out who lucy delaney is.  remember the delaneys from hillcrest road?
yeah. he's a smashing bloke.
search me. i guess we're abandoned.
you want fair pay, make hamburger for mickey d. otherwise, please to sign.
you! how dare you?! stop this car immediately!
you don't have to be embarrassed.
huh?
you can't blame him. you could hardly expect this to go on forever.
ahm....
you quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
jon.  if you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
i wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
i'm sorry mom canned you.
lieutenant... what do you... usually fly?
let's go.
i got a bad feeling, man. i don't want to go in naked.
he's-a very easy to insult --  i say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
hi.  i've got sort of a hypothetical question.  do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
yeah.  i can tell.  victor was right.
i didn't put him in a wheelchair. reynard did. he can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
who are you?  what do you want? why are you loitering in my hallway? speak, dummy, speak!  why don't you speak?
mistake?
and when he looks up? what does he dream about?
we need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
no.
oh, right. cheating death. there's <u>one thing</u> you might try. only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. well, actually two. actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
what are you talking about?
can we talk?
what are you doing here?
well, lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. nice to meet you, jimmy.
sir? right now?
well -- other departments are, yes.
he's a vat grown ninja, the royal family's bodyguard. watch out for him, he's no joke.
truman, you're gonna be late!
i had the group liquidated, you little shit. they were insolent.
i was absent the day they taught that in school. what did she say?
well, jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. his mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by crystal lake...  people started saying it was jason... back from the dead.
it wasn't only that--ned was in a jam.
you wanna go out with him?
i'm sorry, but i...
or albertus magnus. cornelius agrippa...
paul rusesabagina, mr. godefroid. the house manager. i met you on your last visit.
that's more like the old sally--a little bit of fire.  how about ned?
it's too late. no one is allowed to enter the casbah at this hour. it's impossible.
you in charge here?
i'm sure they will.
all right with me, i used to drive a taxi.
i really should get back. there's... there's something i'm supposed to do.
i'd ask for identification.
oh!
what are you talking about?
how could i be so stupid? you'd think i would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
yes.
and the soldier -- he looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
gimme some chili, fries, and a tab.
yo, rocky -- look at this mirror. i'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
and my dad says it's kids. but it's not rats and it's not kids. it's-
nobody move!
possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. a razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. but underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
all right. speak to you then.
1932? that's like, that's like...
i can't make it alone. you're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
san agamat chay bet... envolet!
what?
it's past seven.
hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  sharks don't commit murder. they don't pick out a person....
frida, grab that red one.
they're already dead.  they can't feel a thing.
buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
nope.
but the most interesting thing here is that i don't see the rose tattoo that i've heard about on your back.
i've wondered, diz--maybe this don quixote's got the jump on all of us. i've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
i don't want to go to siberia.
just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
he's pretty laid back, confident.
how do you mean?
ike, you could make a song outta that!
well, the salesman could be available soon.
that's typical.  i hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
you have the worst flu since...
do you remember a case -- 1956 -- hazel dobkins?
tell me how.
fine. roger, what the hell are you doing? you're bothering the serial killer.
we have to find kittle.
what's going on?
not really, no.
what?
cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
one of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
much, thank you.  but i am a little lightheaded.  maybe i should eat something.  hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
but why? oh, you object to the kind of business i do, huh? but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i didn't help them. that's not so bad. through ways of my own i provide them with exit visas.
why don't you shut up and fuck me, professor.
every man dies. not every man really lives.
basically...
i know.  it sucks.  i suck.
i'm not your folks, man. you love this... susan?
why not?!
take a hike, you mean?
yeah, i can see that.  i guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
they'll be along.
i must have made a mistake.
you're vice, not homicide. besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
my pleasure.
that tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
i'm president of the international fletch corporation.
you don't give up, do you?
you glad?
you do?
something good?
absolutely sure there's the triple suns on her gloves!
you harlin?
tonight!  how's tonight?
mr. chekov, slow down. take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
he must have got the keys... off stanton.
homosexual. i like men. sexually.
okay. i'll take two guys off.
he's right.  they'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
a well-timed lightning bolt through her window and monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
yes, i suppose so.
stop equivocating!  unbelievable, how you equivocate!  you, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person i've ever seen!  this is happening, kelvin.  wake up.
shut up!  are you serious? of course i will...of course.
in that case, i accept.
what is debbie's position?
yeah?
would you hold on just a minute here, please? look, there's no reason to panic now. epps saw somebody. fine. it's a big boat.  chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. if we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  the gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. like i said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
of course it is howard. that's why they call it a marathon.
i want him bad.  i don't just want to catch him anymore.  i want to hurt him.
we're talking about something deeper than grudges. how do we respond to personal attack?
yes.
well, let's not get inna fight about it, ma.
serves you right.  will you please stop....
and sleep 'n eat is his comical sidekick?
listen, mister laplante... uh, bernie... who... are... you?
well, dionne warwick, guess his home town.
you've got to respect that.
they're so even keel. they forge ahead with slow determination. they don't get distracted or side-tracked. they don't care what they look like. they don't care that people look at them and go, "ewww. a slug."
i could give it some thought, ben, but my leg is very sore.
roger that.  time to kick some ass!
just a romantic, that's you.
no, i'm okay. i just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
that's not solid.
forever, darlin'. forever. 'til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
you've been working out.
shut up! where’s your wallet?
green spot.
yes, tom -- i think i can manage.
even your own wife, numa.  any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
and i almost got digested. it goes with the job.
no, just you and paulie.
i got a right. you're my father.
we ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
you have an incredible memory.
i was worried about the rig.  i've got over four years invested in this project.
oui.
okay.
not merely as it was a hundred years ago. as it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  madeleine, think of when you were here!
i don't think so.
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. we have compassion for all people.
thanks.  i am.  where's martha?
what?
oh.  what... what time is it?
from the oddest place. his parent's told him. i don't think i got that memo.
the moon?
yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
he was a good man.
oh... uh, thanks a lot enid... i really appreciate it...
it was april.  april seventeenth. that one i remember.
yeah, well, i'll tell ya somethin'. i'll tell ya somethin'. i had this boyfriend, chuck.  ya know him, mac. ya remember, chuck.
look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
i don't have a phone.
he killed milton! the killer's  inside there! oh god!  dewey! dewey's in there too! he needs medical help! he's hurt!
thank you, herr doctor.
in any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. i warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a french court, and when the duchess takes the stand...
thanks.
and another one, but it's from the south.  there.
oh my god, that's him!
they ain't drops--i picked 'em off the tree!
...but who cares?  it was just--  it was fabulous.
splash some water on your face. take a breather.
hi, nikki. this is mike, again. i just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before i gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when i left the dresden, so i knew i'd get your machine. anyway, my number is... 
yeah...i remember my brother-in-law gary, the wheel watcher.  he finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  plus some leather furniture. do you think i saw any of that?  his excuse was the government got it all.
i'm different.
i report to the fbi, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
what does she do with herself after business hours?
the official term is "psychotic".
- - like birds.  what happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
nick.
do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
yes.
i don't know, but the british are excited about it, i know that. the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich.
we'll talk some other time.
what?
c'mon we'll walk and talk...
i don't believe it.
oh, that's not mine.
transpo?  how they bringing the loads in...?
eureka ammunition company, gentlemen. your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  gloria, i could go for you in a big way. however, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and i don't say that to everybody.  have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  yours very truly...
you came to take my wife from me?
i'm a forensic specialist, molly. you've seen my diploma?  i got a diploma and everything.
it's dave wilkie! i'm dave wilkie, don't you remember me?
one job i'd never take is working around electricity.
...de profundis clamo ad te domine.

his victories at charleston and camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  but he has a weakness.
hey, who?
there are certain things i wouldn't do for my country.
it does. we must be getting old, charlie.
nothing i understand better than a mess.
yeah, well, i'm bored, bear. i wanna make movies.

there's no one left ...
believe me i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
it's what i deserve.
we ran down that church hill info. she's right.  there is no richard taupin.
no. not at all.
nobody else had it.
you're talking to the prom queen, eva. do you really think i'm going to risk getting caught?
guessing at this point is useless.
very sporting of you, clayton.
just say "i swear i won't kill anyone."
listen.  last night - oh christ, this'1l take forever to explain. god, michael...
i have money.
well, i'm tired. aren't you tired?
at the end of the bar.
... yes?
an old friend.

but, no, you've been doing that all night!  you're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... you're gonna develop a third nostril!  really,  don't, please.
gimlet.
we clocked the t-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
can i ask you a question?
find that plant.  cut out its heart.
jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  the tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the tourelles, what's to stop talbot attacking the city from the north?
they're not after me.  they want the baby.
not just buy!  you hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  we give you love and affection, don't we?
yes.
yes.
now?
what happened, did you hit him?
what are you talking about?
five seconds.
oh, i'm judy, i go to school with her, i wanted to tell her i'm sorry about thomas j.
no.
when we get to el ray, i'll take care of it.
yah-sure, fine... fine.
in some situations.
yes, sir.
can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? i've done my best. i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts. he got a fee - what i could afford. can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
but we cannot be killed.
i do not.
what...no! put it in the carton.
leaving without saying goodbye. what are you gonna do?
are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
no.
franz!  help!  lunatic!
hey, ray...
september the ninth?
editorials?
why's that?  you said over and over and over, tony clifton is not andy kaufman --
would you talk to her?  she's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  she still blames it for my father's death....
i think you hit him, grandpa. he was limping when he ran off.
yes.
bobo wants you to go on to delmar.
have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator!
i remember you.
all right. two hundred.
my parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  alfred has been supporting me ever since.
we don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
are the glory boys actually showing interest in investigation's work? i may have a stroke.
the boy is happy, fred.  don't be such a killjoy.
call all of them from here to anchorage. tell them we now know that kay connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  we can get it in by the morning editions.
you shot me and murdered my friends.
there's nothing that says i have to work with him.  if somerset wants out, "goodbye."  give it to me.
yeah?
real fast.
well they can fucking un-post it!
then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
i feel like i need you dad's permission just to kiss you. jody, it's time to assert yourself to be a big girl. an individual. i'm going to this party tonight. jimmy's my ride. come over to my house after school. we'll go together.
okay.  you got the "item"?
yeah...?
wait ...
alright. all right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
strange activity.  i think they running drugs off tijuana.  day-day don't believe me.
yeah.
you mean because you thought i was cocky i’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
<i>                      -- a bow? --        but why? --                  how ugly! -- what's in it? --                what's in it?</i>
there is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  lots of dirty little secrets.
go ahead. call them. better tie your shoelaces first.
it's getting there.
anything to help you out, max.
this is going to drive the ante up.
come on.
yeah.
brody's riding his tower.
no kidding. no kidding!
a gag. a gag!
he's saying, what are you saying, bobby?
and he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
beast.
nepal? have you been?
bail, for chrissake!  i'm innocent!
michael, i don't have time. please!  it's time you dealt with this and got over it.  now come on!
i'll say.  holy moley.
that's a bet--but i couldn't let you walk out like that, sally. i'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
i'm just a happy camper. rockin' and a-rollin'. van patten  rehab's done wonders for you, pal. working for unicef now?
pony, what would you say our relationship is?
no, the morning rooster woke me.
yeah! you better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. it's in that place where i put that thing that time?
i wondered what happened to her...
for what?
that's a terrific line. you're going to be a wonderful writer.
how do you figure?
it happened in australasia.  he checked in yesterday.  no family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  as far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. you just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
what would have elapsed?
those "dears" sound like daggers. may i suggest that you stop daring her to speak?
interrogation's over, bedsoe.
the rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the jew in miami.
it's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
good.
does tony ever tell you to do things?
i don't know. we'll find out.
no, the milk comes when the baby comes.
really, that's a long time.
i don't want it.
tell me, how do you do that?
you sunk my battleship.
just want to talk to him a second.
uh-huh. and where's the press galery?
leo.  leo's twenty-eight, cal.
the most powerful man in america is president nixon, probably you've heard his name.
...it isn't you...?  who is it? who is this i'm talking to?  i need the leads...
nothing.
i know what it's like to see ghosts that don't go away.  to be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
i'm not touchy, i just, it's a silly question, that's all.  am i happy?  are you happy?
couple of bucks.
this can't be...
what one?
well, jay. they've been exceptionally supportive.
then perhaps you need to know me.
i'm not guaranteeing a thing, mr. bernstein.  you people work too fast for me!  talk about new brooms!
shove it, ralph!
what you got, peters?
i mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
huh-huh....you son of a bitch!
annie, you didn't. tell me you didn't.
well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this st. peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
brought on by what?
listen, daniel, hang on one second.
no, not -- i mean have you, you know --
it's not for sale.
why? because i give a shit?
i'm leavin' the place to john.
thursday's fine...
lemme down, bugface!
if you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
he's hidin'. word's out tommy reina's goin' over ta maranzano.
that's my line!
just do what i tell you.
you keeping out of trouble?
call up the bank.  i called them.
i think it's a different place for each person.
i'm miss wilson - mrs. schuyler's social secretary.
mr. dean--
it seems human.  to me.
damn it, norman.  i swear.  i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
thta's not charlie's work --
it's you ben who needs to talk. i've had my say, and i'm waiting to hear back from you.
well, it isn't coming out until the february iss...sure.  sure, go ahead, ricky.
got a pencil?
liz, i'm really sorry.  the meeting went much longer than expected.
i don't know why i brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... it came out first... hey, you kiss him -- me... he says he loves you. you two hit it off. but you don't want to... fine... forget what i said about sex with simon. it was a mistake.
p-a-r-k-e-r.  right.  get on the horn with philly.  call me here.
they're withholding payment.
i'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...i know how busy you guys can get.
yes.
hello, miss daniels.
billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
i thought you -- why -- love ruins everything, doesn't it?
i want to live.
so wait a minute. the red sox haven't won a world series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
nice to meet you, mr. stubbins.  a little something i baked.
virgil, please.  don't do this to me.
what's he got against me... i mean, i 'm a teenager. you can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
hi, how'd your day go?
her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. on the day he died, he was setting a test. to prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. he had to be certain. he said he was going to give mrs. peel something ...
great.  network news, washington... i love it.  what do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
i don't think that's the way it works, cole.
that french ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
hmm.
you remember this?
i feel as if you haven't heard anything i've been saying to you.
you want my advice?
i'll never be able to do that.
heh, what a hypocrite.
waiting for luis to call me. he said he'd call tonight. oh don't be difficult, patrick.
okay...
bullshit.  you wanted me to kill her.
well, you're the organizer. you work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. but when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. you afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. it is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. an extract from the diary is shown.
ça alors! from charles?
i don't smoke.
yeah, no, i have to get something from my car, i said.
i'm gonna wet my pants.
you know where i can find her?
go to jim morrison's grave at pere lachaise. it's overrun with american tourists. i have to work.
dad!
we are to meet mr. rutagunda.
are you screwy?
sorry?!
ya never tell a guy about a broad.
no!
it says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the ludovico treatment. alex signs. governor gathers up papers. alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
play it once, sam, for old time's sake.
what...?
pardon me?
now, come on -- you know i'm not ready for that kind of --
he said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
what's normal?
non!
sue ann hanson.
i'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  and don't worry about the vase.
oh, you're changing your mind --
it was like tommy was possessed or something. there was a hate in his eyes that i couldn't really call human.
i thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person i'm looking for.
he's nothing but a hypocrite. he preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
i need you there with me. i need your expertise on this. the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
ethan, you're not making sense. let me go in and talk to kittridge. i'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
tonight. let's get together.
you set up the line-up.
good. is there anything you need -- money -- ?
oh, humdinger. when- well, i got a wonderful idea. why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. you know, it's a-
yes--i think maybe you'd better.
a loan officer?
you weren't helpin'.
is there a rush?
you'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. she killed a man.
hmmm...
i gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-i've got mixed emotions-i don't know if i can handle this.  oh, boy...
with all my heart.
well, thank you for all your help, mrs. johnson.
grant?  you'll never get him out of montana.
i don't mean that. how would he act? what would he do?
i didn't know it was classified information.  i mean, i know we don't have any customers, but i thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
well, sure, but--
i know.
handle what?
you don't.  <u>remember</u>.
how do you know about that?
i'm sorry, dr. smyslov, but i'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
whadda you care?
why you want to do that, to a frien'?
her doctors murdered her.  they gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    her doctors murdered her.
i can't.
the look on your face!  you're not marriage material.  you're not even boyfriend material.  you're a kid. a big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
<u>what</u>?!
well, it's a good morning, anyway.
yes.
can't we fix it?
you should go back to her.
"stuff."  were the mid-terms hard?
huh?
listen, doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
yes.
last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  have you figured out what i'm doing?
the alicorn, lad.  come to your senses!  unless we find baron couer de noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
let's settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
no.
you want some advice? don't do this again.  you know exactly what i mean.
i know.
what's your subject?
i'm just on vacation.
is the hill ours too?
we'll see.  let's try clark.
could we have you in here, please...7
i got to, mama. i know daddy wants to see him.
he heard.
you never know.
'cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her moms and if i don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. you want her to die?
i need to confess.
we're getting married.
immigration's gonna love you for that.
tonight?
may i be quite frank with you?
hi.
welcome.
but you didn't tell me!
that's wonderful, miss van deusen...what's it about?
tilt we figure something out.
well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
it's not a compliment.
the greatest.  they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors.  hey, easy on the punch bowl.  budget only calls for three drinks per extra. fake the rest.
that unit no longer functions. i have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting enterprise.
george, glad you could make it, son. hi, doll.
dad, here! you don't have to stop, just slow down. you can tell mama i jumped out. she knows that's the kind of thing i'd do. she won't blame you.
ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  just get me to the bar... it's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
not doin' them very fine, o'neil.
no, look.  i do mind.  the dude minds. this will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  i mean, if your wife owes--
thanks -- whoa, professor tripp, careful here...
nothing has. but that's all changing.
intriguing. i wish i had more time to discuss this matter.
so you took off your shirt?
oh, shut up!  you haven't even got your spats on.
who paid the bill?
yeah, yeah... are you okay?
oh.
for the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, i'm never alright.  when i secure the line, come on up.
thank you, spock.
well, mr. proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  it's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
it's fine.
what do you care? suppose i was pregnant. just suppose it. you don't think i'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
now it makes sense, the whole neo bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. you're a poor little rich girl.
mr. wayne ... something wrong?
with emily?
yeah? i wouldn't have thought that.
don't ask any questions. come on!
jerry is dangerous.  jerry has killed --
no. you don't understand. your brother -- frank -- he's here in the house. and he's --
yes.
nah, really, it was moronic.
four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the green dragoons under tarleton.
i'd like to be a farmer. i want to help things grow, to encourage life. do you and your friends need a farmer?
fine.
what'd you do?
it was the only way i could get the movie made!
why they glow like that?
they sure do.
having a pint in the metro, and dil's having a margarita.
trying to be.
does he have the spot?
the hell i can't!
that's father, aubrey. seamus well yes i did.  lived here my whole life.
they hear you comin'.  they won't bother you. just don't sneak up on 'em.
the cowboy??
you're right!
include me in that.
take ten.
yeah, i just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
no women. not in boodles. not since 1922.
hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  heee hee-haaa....
keep dreaming.
there's another wire from peter, sir. they're in glen falls, michigan.
i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
well dude, we just don't know.
what do you mean what kind of person? he's a good person.
i'm not kidding. marriage is -
right. i'm sorry.  you've got a reputation to think about.
how'd you know that?
how do you know all this?
yes, janet.  leave the crying to brad.
43   continued:
have you warned professor hikita?
what if you don't?  then i'm fucked. you see...?  then it's my job. that's what i'm telling you.
perk.
uh-huh?
aren't your parents asleep?
overruled.
how do you put a price on murder?
what –
we got disconnected before....
alan
this is not the way it was supposed to-- i was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- i don't even like smoking!
things changed, mary. the reasons for finding jacqueline changed. i want to find jacqueline to settle things.
maybe you love her. but what do i know? i'm baked out of my mind.
yeah, he told me once himself. he said to me...
you got weird kids, frank.
sid...you got me so...i don't know what...
what shows?
and they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
i can't really go into it right now. i'll just tell you it's someone big.
just what i had in mind.  everything dead on earth except us.  a chance for mother nature to start again.  plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  sorry hon, this is for science.  behold the dawn of a new age.
right.
okay...
this isn't simulation anymore. take'er out easy, cadet.
how 'bout the tree? you want the tree?
i know.
we'd be in all the papers!
he wasn't a lonely man, though.
then fuck it!!!
no! wait! erik! the cloak! the cloak invisible! it only seems to work on my father!
thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts you were a great star and you had a good run. that oughta be enough.
the point is— there isn't much time, kid.
if you go, i go.
...until our wedding night. when our bodies will join.
where do you send them?
no it's not okay. it's not.
how many?
really?
opportunities?
i'm sorry. what will you do?
je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
me, me, me!
don't really have the market for something like this...  i can go two...two-fifty.
i have a knack for designing clothes. but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
no you're not. how... nice one. how dumb do you think i am ?
you tell me what to do, i'll do it.
ah...
he bought you that?
and your duke?  the duke of bedford?
looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
i've been looking for him.  do you know where he is?
yes.  it's perfect, isn't it?
like hell it does.
laplante!
yeah.  i'm ghosting pretty bad.
actually, that's why i stopped by. he's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
yeah yeah yeah. yadda yadda yadda. were you stoned?
what i just said, no assassin would say.  what i've said, only a mark would say.
it all keeps coming back to dudley.
very good, doctor.  i've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
do you like fish?
thirty meters up, lance; i saw the fucking flash.
i wondered. did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
put the bolts on that window under a scope, i'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
i can't complain.
mmmmm.
yeah, grass, right? the illusion that it will make a white woman more like billie holiday.
good.
yes.  that's it.  happy.  well, whatta ya think of that.  happy.
i'll have to wash one out.
the place has already be combed. forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
too many times.
how can i calm down when i'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  i've had enough!
no! would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
but how could he know?  he only just met me.
um, no.
what's this country coming to?
taken what?
maybe.  i'll call him.
i hope not . . . i've got to call on her this morning!
was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
and then what?
what?
maybe it's an italian thing. their mother was italian.
what?
where?
that's right. you got it! sure! he came in here and i made him change his mind. "bulletin editor saves john doe's life." why, it's perfect. i'll have ned write it up.  oh, ned!
defensive pattern kirk epsilon. geordi, get those shields online.
you sure?
i know.  you're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
okay.
getting cold.
no, no, what, what is it?
uh-huh.
why.
at least i improved myself. what's up?
check ncic, maybe he's got a record.  then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
and i'm supposed to care.
you've got good days and bad days.
clear!
oh, grady. you're such a putz.
check...
i've been saying that since we met.
i've got something on this. i know a guy on the inside with the military...
that was never proved.
yes -- i mean -- you never get anyone in 'wings of a dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the pentagon that we need black star cover.'
shit, dude, i didn't know.  i wouldn't've done it if i knew he was a fucking crybaby.
yes.
whisky and a peach.
well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
it wasn't fast enough.
after he tried to shoot you?
we need a warrant.
how the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
yeah.  she told me.
yes. i can see: you've hung the rest of your relatives.
sighs as honora puts the frying pan on the stove.
what's going on down there?
land of the free...
won't say.  says he must talk to you.
who do you think could've done this?
hello, miss wells.
for what?
my doctor lady?
he didn't mean it nasty.  he said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
no!
paul... paul.... we'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  a whole year, in fact. right now i just need to finish my pie and get home.
thank you, exposition.
please.
my nephew, leonard. he worships me.  let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
i will. and i choose --
it's wonderful....
well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  only when it was funny.
i'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
and what's that supposed to mean?
you could do anything. you could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! you'd have superpowers.
i sure do.
but i don't have that any more...  ... all that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
willie mays.
clockworks.
who --
all the adulation?  it makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
you have a responsibility to tell me.
[daniel.]
animal! animal! wake up!
you just want to ask me questions?
i don't love ya no more.
huh?
oh.
you were looking for us?
okay.
well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
can't you understand--i got tired of being a woman. i wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
that's because we live in the future. which is what's on my mind.
you're a liar.
fucking a, my friend.
no, doctor jones. it's yours!
i know how it is.  my dad collects miniature canon.
you like kids.
chicken?
you were saying you don't want a million dollars.
my secretary.
yeah. see you in the fleet, sarge. and thank you.
why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in aspen. i told the man in sonora there were four of us. if only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. we've got to stick together. like we've always done.
why did you quit?
tonight was supposed to be the night, trevor. remember? i couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
magic.
it lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. forty million beats.
we're coming to arcade.  shall we relive together?
i can't afford civility, sir.  how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  even if i make it under these rules, i still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "yeah, she made it, but..."  i mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
what do you mean? would you rather have terrorists?
i said i'm trying to reach talby. something's wrong with the damn intercom. i need a last-minute diameter approximation.
she kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  leave us all behind.  that <i>he</i> was going to take her!
uhura, i had the strangest dream. i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise.
sid, why would a guy like pierce patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
ray, you heard him...
[four-seven-four-seven.]
it did.  it is.  there's nothing we can do about that.
uh ... i mean you're on right after this act.
boy, i hope so, buckaroo banzai.
i'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
to have a good time with you until you have to go.
come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. if they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
and some really fast cars.
that's true, mr. simms.
any sign of our friend?
i flushed it down the toilet.
he's insulting me. rat bastard. he's never been any fuckin' good.
you do --
i don't know if there's anything wrong with me because i don't know how other people are.....sometimes i cry a lot.....for no reason.
over my dead body.
shall we go inside? i should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
ok, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  but tom, i want you to stay inside the mall. you too, mike, no chances.  tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  the hospital is yours; i want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
especially not your dad.
forget wes.
you serve martinis, doncha?
there is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
you know somebody around here?
i just want to find a suitcase.
i just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  clear my head.
home.
...as opposed to a print...
yeah.  you mind?
well, you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger.  you wore jeans and t-shirts, and so did i.  and i still do, and you don't.
what is it, your laundry?
your credit's fine, mr. torrance.
what's this?
nice to meet you?
no. they occupy the fortress, but they cannot control its movement. it is moved by fate. and, sooner or later, fate will place it near us.
uh...yes.  but...
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... oh, no, i think that was johnson, air boss of the kitty hawk!
i am alone in the world.
then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. you need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. name's jangle leg.
what's your game? what do you shoot?
antibiotic.
ok forget it, just stay on the phone.
well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? then again...i am worth twice as much alive.  didn't know? johns ain't a cop. oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and i'm just a payday. that's why he won't kill me. the creed is greed.
with the forty thousand dollars?
but i know you, don't i? i seen you on a poster in the theater district. i'll think of your name in just a --
i found some in my purse; would you like one?
what? it's a perfectly good word, ain't it. how much time i got?  goddam sand thing drive you crazy. kee-rist. spelling never was a very strong point with me. even in school.
lds?? are you dyslexic on top of everything else? come on, lemme give you a lift. i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why i work with whales.
oh, but it will end well for love?
mom, we already...
the wallet! he took derek's wallet!
you'll be rich!
that's what i thought.  you better give me another example.
and then you'll be happy?
you think it will?
what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson.
thanks.
and?
don't do this
great. i've just started a new company. solid financing. it's good.  i love you jacko, you know that
gross. what is it?
uh-h-h-h...nothing!  uh, nothing. i'm sure andy was just a little excited, that's all.  too much cake and ice cream, i suppose.  it's just a mistake.
you can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
no, surprise, i thought you'd be--
well, if things go the way i hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  god willing.
now you're talking.
but if you did.
this is something that is never going to end.  you can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. to survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  and that's going to take money, a lot of money.
and no one's there now?
i'm mike.
dad was never in england?
ain't it just? the man who invented beer, louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
hi, jennifer.
i don't know what i've got.
what's your name?
hi, allison --
that's what i'm here for.
just do what i tell ya and everything'll be jake.
just sweeney again. one of my best reporters.
'swell.' when  was the last time i heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
what do you want to know?
and when they shot me father...
it was making me nervous, so i chopped it off.  big mistake, huh?
i love you so much, and i hate this war so much. oh, it's a crazy world. anything can happen. if you shouldn't get away, i mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever i'll be, i want you to know...
no, just the paper will be fine.
having a nervous breakdown.
a wedding band??? what am i supposed to be able to do with this?
no. we're friends. i wanna remain friends.
gotta go.  see ya soon.  everybody happy now?
well, there you go. but what does that tell ya? a million dollars in jewelry. does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
no...
and i offer only this, father. to commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
don't be ridiculous, we're having a serious conversation!
i know. amazing.
not so!  no.  i think i've been very supportive.  i've...i try to give you honest, constructive advice.
sure. why not.
i'd say we're in its home.
yes.
hey. there.
because he'd shot mueller.
i can't have been under much more than a minute.
what's 'at?
hey, pete. how's it going?
just let me rest for a second.
i love her.
what theater was i at?
ain't he warning up?
sure thing.
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command? woody oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
fine. have a seat.
in symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
you trust him.  he's got that strength.  you'd die in a second for john.
what a nose.  you missed your calling.
and what is that?
we're worried about you. "60 minutes" was on same-sex couples.
they arrived, can you believe it?
okay, try me on sunday.  i'm going out to the everglades on saturday.  you guys can wash the mud off.
oh. tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
yeah. yeah. i get your thought. you know i seen you lots of times before. parochial school on pulaski street? seven, eight years ago? your hair come down in—
aye -- that i would, lass.
yes.
it's not a boat boat.  it's really a house.
the past six months.
the point is, you've got to find something new.
your a nurse?
you heard me. where is it?
do you still love her?
i'm not scared, mrs. robinson.
excuse me?
-- please -- jason -- omigod --
good, sir.
yes!  this is about me.  why can't you understand that, you of all people? it's not the war -- it's nixon!  they want to destroy nixon!  and if i expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  do you want that?  do you want to see that, buddy?  it's not pretty.
rats?
actually, gordon, you're not gonna do that.  i'm taking control of the team.
no.
i'd like to think so. i know one of them went on to medical school.
oh, no.
no. it's too late. the food is coming and everything. damone, i've got to ask you this favor, and i'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
you were right. he's trying to fuck you. you want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
i don't know. i thought this is what you wanted. you want stability, here it is.
never heard of him. don't vouch for him.
been putting my files into it. you take sugar and milk?
jim mason?  oh, yeah. yeah. no, i didn't send it. i've got it written out, though. here it is.  "arthur's been with the tallow works too long. stop. don't think we should fire him. longfellow."
i know.  me neither.
just put your mask on.
i have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. ornithology happens to be my avocation, miss daniels. you're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. there's a vast difference between...
what?
whatever you do, don’t mention italy. or politics. or baby buggies.  or edith piaf.
any ideas?
i am with you!
you want a pint, go to the pub.
all that at the eagle hotel. it's beyond everything.
shut up!!!  shut up and drive!  i'm your superior officer and you will do as i goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. hey, why don't you buy another beer. it's on me, okay?
where are you going vit the light?
whaddaya mean, you don't know?
uh, yeah, well, believe me, i sure feel like i know you!
why?
at the bus station. he said i'd be a perfect call girl. and that he knew an agency in california that, on his recommendation, would handle me. they have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. and all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. at least five hundred. they drive porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like nancy allen in "dressed to kill". and when i was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. he says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. but no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. so what i'm doin' for drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. it seemed like a lotta fun, but i don't really like it much, till last night. you were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. since it was a secret, i just pretended i was on a date. an, um, i guess i want a second date.
you gave them the eight billion.
you told swayzak about our arson lead. it's all over the fucking news.
yeah?
"mocky-lock is the bogeyman.  mocky-lock wants me where i am."
one.
i hardly know him.  he wanted me and he couldn't have me.
just go.  kristen needs you.  keep her awake somehow.  do it.
-- this your idea of small talk?
nice try. you had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  would he?
it doesn't matter, alright.  just leave it alone.
i think you must be mistaken, sir.
i'm ... your son ...
big deal?  if that's not love, i don't know what is.
i only found out you were here yesterday.
i just had a mental picture of...
you already went back to work.
but you don't have a choice anymore. you've become a significant threat to the national security structure. they would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  you're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. you gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. i hope you get a break...
i need... to talk to you.
you got a better idea...?
it was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
what?
my signal's fading.
no, no music.
i'm here!  sarah, i'm here!  i'm here--i've got you!
there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. i got to thinking. i'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
he was... taken.
he didn't mention?
the little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
jesus, i didn't say it was.
you ain't got to do nothing. just point at it and push the button. you'll hear the car go "bleep." that means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
you'll know me by the time we're through.
no.
because i can't have you!
oh, i'm sure i can.
crooked? i should think you'd be glad to find out i wasn't crooked.
because she's the type.
i know, i know.  i'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... speaking of which...
long, boring, and generally pretty sad. arnie seemed to enjoy it...  hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
every time i said it, it was. i never really thought i was going to make it.
eighteen.  well, i'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
what?
lookit, don't worry about it.  it's not a new concept. wake me when we touch down, will...
it's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. you got any coffee?
it's what you would do to me
mr. chairman -
thanks. i'll tell mike.  well, it's still just a beginning. i know i can...dig deeper.
you'll be safe here.  he won't kill in a church.
home?
he lost all the weight... there.
you sure this is okay?
well, somebody better go tell the damn yankees!
keep firing!
fine.
just some young guy.  around twenty years old.  dark hair.
you might want to find out. he might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
...and?
just to keep him out of the sun.
i thought we were meeting here.
oh indeed?
that's what i said, so i went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. he's got plenty of room out there to dig. the kid's really blossomed. now i can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
let's go, guys.
oh, you do?
cool.
yes -- and that's the reason i wanted to talk with you. you got my invitation?
shari, i really like you...
it's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  one person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
of course he did, for god's sake.  didn't he, mr. pritchett?
excellent, athos.  you have a keen sense of this man.
strategically.
i don't know. will there?
all right.
he has phil right now.
mollie, drop down here! you've fainted!
take it easy.
then go.
i'd best talk with mr. scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
you got a deal. 
once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
looking for someone.
well, i ...
no charge.
then how come they haven't set the bail yet? that's unconstitutional.
i know that.
you were a tiger last night.
he recognized you!
yes it does.  the fairy queen told me.
it's eating a hole in the floor!
guy named wade beemer.  used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97.
awright. an' if she gets outa han', i'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
i'd like to read it some time.
yeah, like that...  but, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  everybody dies.
okay.
can't you get the money from your friends?
oooh, thank god.
cq what?
i do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
which would force our delegates in philadelphia to vote for independence.
no problems on both counts.
i thought you said we were going to be friends.
it's good for me - i know them, i'm familiar with them.  it's good for you - you'll be compensated.  it's good for the army.  you know what i'm going to make?  artillery shells.  tank shells. they need that.  everybody's happy.
really? - god, how time flies!
yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? you think he'll come down for that?
mr. d'amour?
... does this do anything?
yes.
one night more won't matter. your friend'll be there. anyway i don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. he knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
you're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  it's going to blow up!
ah yes, the first rule of academics. publish or perish.
i remember something lost ... i'm so confused! oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! do you think i could have... belonged to you ...
fuckin' a, first survive, yes?
this man sounds like a real catch.
i'm finished.
it's esther. santa's got her.
a headache?
yeah sort of. where's lloyd?
excuse me, gentlemen
whataya mean, no record?
of course.  look -- i've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
need a little help with that, mr collins?
travis, you haven't even played the record?
that's ridiculous -- thea's lovely, gentle —-
"oh, tract housing, huh?"  laugh. "you need a new real estate agent."
no, i think maybe you've been right.  i think i may have been too critical in the past.
soft and supple. like a lady's.
you get his statement?
take a whiff of heaven.
it's a sign i've watched this movie too many times.  i'm so stupid.  from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio, i've been a complete jerk.
so, i'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an emperor and a murderer?
then why don't we just get it out of the way.
i don't have a girlfriend --
maybe i have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, susie.  you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob, the cia, fbi, and army intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  we got leaks everywhere! we're going to trial here!  what the hell do we really got?  oswald, ruby, banister, ferrie are dead.  shaw - maybe he's an agent, i don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
weight!  hey!  blow the man down...
yeah i can't.
dorothy. no!
that girl was amanda krueger.  her child --
better unlock the door.  sit up, darling, and be dignified.
but, madame! if you don't think about food what do you think about?
excuse me, we need to make a call.
that's him.
you want anything special for dinner?
they sure did! they got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? i'm sure glad i came all the way out here to find them out.
i'm stuck!
if they don't take me out before then. [as an afterthought] what's the net?
where's the ring?
you will always!
i pack up and go somewhere else.
were you paid for it—or weren't you?
why?
no...we want padded chairs...okay?
i know, man.
history, leonard.  <u>history</u>. everything else is conversation...  how's the other matter?
son, please, now....
look around, this place is a dump!  naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
do you live alone?  i've been in these clothes since...the killings.  could we stop at your place? i could take a shower...before i go into custody?
oh baby.
cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
what?
if dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
so do you what, you hoodoo!  and now, mr. pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
i'm afraid i can't offer you any real protection. i have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
everyone handles it differently. some are ready, some are not.
no books. no elephants either. no really good elephant books.
we're gonna die, boiler. we're gonna die.
maybe you should think about it.
no.  the righteous brothers.
i can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. i can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. i can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "friends" and "seinfeld"...
bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
who's sonny chiba?
me, too.  i'm getting married tomorrow.
fine. you want to help ricky, talk to maxie yourself.
are you an fbi man?
i appreciate your concern, number one, but i've been itching to try out the argo.
how'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
dream on, auggie. she'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
shut up.
i can watch you, eddie.  maybe i'll learn something.
good day to our brothers-in-arms. have you come to join us?
i always throw that in. it makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
okay, but you're missing all the fun.
well, i'm following up on your daughter, mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  born april 24, 1976.  missing june 11th, 1992.  a runaway, that's how she's listed. is this information correct... ?
good lad, ringo.
i don't know. she didn't leave a note. the house is all messed up.
how am i a hypocrite?
i read your column every day...
what?
no!  them!  shoot them!  cross the beams.
...there's a start for a meeting.
shhh!  they're sleeping.
thirty-fifth.
i have this button i press. see? it insulates me. she mimes an air lock valve.
marcie - calm down. calm down and don't do this. i want you to stay --
cops aren't allowed to do that either. a judge ruled that that was entrapment. don't ask me why. i guess he figured the sight of a vice officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
you're quick.  mayor cobblepot.
not in that way; you're always looking for company.
do you wash your hands before you type things?
i'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
bad?
and you were drilling these holes...?
stay back.
i want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. to meigs field.  at meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the gulf stream.
yes. up here on the fifteenth floor. goodnight.
no?  who am i, then?
i'm sorry my friend, i'm not signing books right now. there's been a tragedy.
okay barton, you're the artist, i'm just the ten percenter. you decide what you want and i'll make it happen. i'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if i can use that word and hollywood in the same breath.
yeah, i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
well, uh...promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
i wish i could be that way.
everything. just for the record.
straylight. kitchen dock.
how are you paying tor the braces, donnie?
oh i do... but i say i don't. 
is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
anybody else have a key to the house.
keep climbing.  i will follow...
round back.
what michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
i'm on my way to chicago. very important meeting tonight. well -- any new developments?
we'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
lemmee see that schofield, kid.
and he invented fire.
there <u>have</u> been northern sightings. but not <u>this</u> north.
it shouldn't be a long delay.
an eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to klingon attack. korrd-you tell him.
yes, yes i know. victor, whatever i do, will you believe that i, that --
i'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. if i can... slide your cuffs free.
great...  ...wanda!
hey, i thought we come for a drink.
i'm not going to rob you, mister.  do i look like a thief?
i didn't think so.
understanding the following rights...
it's all my fault. what have i done, animal? what have i become? look at me. this isn't me. i don't do things like this.
what you have to understand, francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... i don't know.
i just knew i was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
not for me, it ain't.
it wasn't like that.
well, he's a good soldier.
so now it's tasker?  not renquist?
this'll only take a minute. there's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
you were in love with him, weren't you?
sure. are you kidding? sure.
you're the one who said he was good looking. you think he's good looking 'cause i know you think he's good- looking. i'll smash his face inside out. i'll make him into dog meat. nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when i get through with him. so you just go ahead and think about who you want.
do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
good school!  and your family doesn't object to your career?
i am impressed.  we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
why?
why don't you get another one? why don't , you get another job?
hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. an' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
the police department?
who said anything about "loser?" where do you get this word "loser?"
good answer.
okay, sure, mick.
fucking figures. look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? we got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. why did they kill the guys in the other two booths? why did he do the bartender? it would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  god, i hate cold crime scenes! i'm fucking leaving now. and do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
i don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  i just want to be able to rub epps' face in it when i crack this thing.
what's the rush?
poor baby.
funny.  so am i.
i do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for fiji tomorrow.  but you wouldn't want to do that.
to see pap.
neither do i.
what are we doing here, diego?  this guy's a clown.  he's talking about clothes.
with what?  how am i going to interface with it?  i need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
my pleasure.
naw.
yeah, i got that. some people think it's all in their heads.  it's been so bad she's had to move back here to mumford and live with us. and i'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
where's the sphere?
oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
she's what?
where is the subway station, please.
not as much as i used to.  ever since we started, i haven't really gone in to school that much because i've been getting more and more auditions --
away.
and i'm its deliverer.  its calling card, if you will.  i follow it.  protect it. act as its guardian.  in a sense, sam, so do you.
yes.  we won't be able to have dinner tonight.  something's come up.  i hope you don't mind.
just good luck.
no. probably stay at a motel tonight.
i'm a woman, martie...  we wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...when you're little we even wash <u>you</u>....how a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman i'll never know...
yeah... but it seems they're bringing malcolm's widow betty shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for ramparts.  and they want us to help with security.
just my son and i.
no caviar for me, thanks.  never did like it much.
stop saying fantastic.  where are you going?
why do you always focus on the negative? didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
what a handsome word.
i don't know. i was just curious.
what mission?
god, yes. like silk.
maybe they got crimes in california we don't know about. crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
he ain't got five kids to feed.
i'll do my best, madame, even if i have to work every night.
su-ure.  two people hired me to find zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  but it's not necessary.  people are dead.  one was a friend.  the same people were involved in a scam to rip off grendel records. bottom line's julian grendel is doing a little revenge number...
c'mon johnny.
did they...
-- it's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
what is it?
i know that. don't let him get away.
anything like work aroun' here?
well ain't you amazing.
get used to me, inspector. i'm not going anywhere.
no.
who knows?
i see.
one just doesn’t... tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
none.  this was arranged.
might be all right.
just tell me the fucking riddle.
you two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
how would you describe him?
he only bit women so far, right?
that's nice. it's nice.  i've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. do you remember all that pudding?
what?
he only shot you once.
a chicken?
yeah, what for?
i'd say logic more than faith.  the odds were on my side.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
i'll deal with her later.
look, i came here to get papers to travel to paris and. . .
do we shake hands?
tired...
i was wondering what that was.
no, no --
what ain't there?
what makes you think we want to be cured? blood is only part of the equation. the hunt, the killing, that's what the thirst is really about.
he said immediately.
friends? who needs friends.  a boy's best friend is his mother.  you've never had an empty moment in your whole life. have you?
where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  it's not...
yes, my liege.  stand by for attack!!
keys were in it ...
every class has its surprises, pyro. this one'll be no different.
how should i be ... arrogant?
sorry. i’m a little nervous. i never thought something like this would happen to me.
he busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  we pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
yes, sir.
let her go!  let her go!!
i know.
but it's romantic.
do you have any idea who she is?
ail right. by the way, his friend...?
i'm not wrong. she told me so. besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. i'd know anyway.  i found out a lot of things last night.  i'm not ashamed of it either. it's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. get you to kill the wrong guy.
pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
it won't register.  it's too big to image.
okay. good tits. can't we show them off a little more?
duck!
stay!
they have these little sticks, vince. they call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
what?
when she...
this is a new brig, captain. it is escape-proof.
really? the chink, huh? i've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. what else have you learned from the chink?
sure.
--sig-sauer .38.  i love it.
canada is saving us!!
it never was supposed to he! why isn't it possible?
i can't do that!
like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
well, christ, if i'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, i wouldn't have bothered. are you going to eat that?
oh, all the time.
i believe in you.
sure, i can't last forever. i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper.
please, paul, 'til first light.
sorry, coach.
and what was that?
what did you say, sir?
lisa sherman?
my husband believes in you.  we're gonna make it.  bye bye dorothy.
you mean the designs for the nanobot?  you think after this i'm going to give them to him?
yeah.  but first i want to brace stompanato.
stop it...
because i say so.
that's a big comfort to me.
i got you.
yeah, sure. it is that kind of a day. when?
boss, the president's been shot.  in dallas.  five minutes ago.
ummm -- figure eight?
i put them in your hamper.  i thought they were dirty.
will be.
for what?
why?
no thanks!
what's her name?
nothin's bent.
thank you, father, thank you.  whatever. goodbye, amen.
things have become complicated. katrina is at the mill.  ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  find her at all costs.  quickly.
well, i've called you here because i've had a chance to see the new legislation. it's exactly what was rumored. arrest without warrant. automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
did you guys hook up or something?
call the ranch, tell beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
who?
you cannot go alone.
yes. i'm waiting for my lunch.
he couldn't have.
remember what lenin said in 1917, mr. president: "the power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  the communists have never been closer.  now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  let the communists know you're onto them.
i'll watch for him, sir.
it's his life insurance money, you know.
this is my new friend...
she's dead.
we put her in a safe house.
i dunno. why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
let's not get carried away.
got any requests?
there are no worse places.
easy now... that mare's in season.
i want my lawyer!
we can't worry about everything right now. we've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
what month?
as long as it is scotch.  your white friends have abandoned you, paul.
i'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think i'm doing?
you knew, didn't you, john?  you knew.
stand back -- i'm about to do my happy dance.
is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  god, michael --- what am i...?
have you got your passport?
you needn't be embarrassed, madame. a lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
christ, i don't believe this!
so tell me, cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because i want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
a vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
we had fun. i even got along with talia-- for about three minutes. i don't know why she hates me so much...
oh, it's okay. it's just not something to be ashamed of. maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, i'd give it, say... a two.
i wish you didn't have to go so early.
only one way to find out.
look!  sarah!
you know, i never had friends like this.
how is it you can look at that hairhead and see god, when all i see is a lucky asshole from reseda.
oh my god.
how do i know you didn't?
yeah, i heard that.  now tell me what you really do.
fine, thank you. did you watch the show?
reverend chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
put in one of your fixes. walt knows he's loused himself with the church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
you haven't seen anything yet.
he any good?
i'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  want some?
i guess you have to get back home soon?
i liquidated the last account in zurich, and split it into two new ones in estonia.
that was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. listen, johnny, there's a question i want to ask you. and i want you to tell me the truth if you can. why do men chase women?
taking you for granite?
maybe they're not out there.
little bit.  yeah.
roberto.  who owns the 'rat-holes.'
139  continued:
it's the lebaron.
i got. i got it. friday the 13th, part 20.
what were you -- a child actress?
just tonight, please?  i can't handle the nightmare.  not tonight.  not after phillip.
i should do this myself.
open a window. every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
try the wine!
why, mr. merrick, you're not an elephant man at all...
anytime, sport.
i couldn't help myself.  you get lost inside a women like her.  it was like a drug.  it was the best sex i ever had.
don't know.
good god!
why should anyone vote for him? he's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  and they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
b:  ryan is dead.  he's been blown up by the german equivalent of wade, whose name i know you don't want me to mention.  there's nothing to find. the biggest piece is the size of a pea.  we wander around, looking for him until the germans pick us off, one after another.
how is he?
promises mean nothing.
how did you get here?
how are you?  what's that you're working on, johnny?
a french & indian army out of fort carillon's heading south to war against the english. i'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the british defense.
bit messy.
oh, paul. it would be an honor.
i ain't stupid.
wow, you get a whole room in your own house? she's got you on a long leash there, mark.
well, gentlemen, i'm afraid our rates are rather high.
friends of yours michael.
not this week.
it ain't for lack of trying.
ha!  that's the best part. i can't!!
let it go.
they say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. they all wear the same uniform.  please.  be careful.  the man driving the car must have a gun.
yes.
well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
that's it. i'm gonna have to tell my little brother, i'm gonna die. i can't make him his lunches anymore.
which brings me back to my original question. what was he doing here in the first place?
okay.
i'm not going.  i'm okay.
she could have been killed...you knew and you didn't tell us...you let your mother think....
wade, what the hell are you doing here?
so am i.  yes. that's right, will. most days i wish i never met you. because then i could sleep at night. i wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. and i wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
i'm just warning you, i can't swim.
ninotchka, or shall i say special envoy yakushova...
because i don't like you.
it will all be over in such a little while, jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. drink your coffee.
i talked a man back once. three months later, we lost him. it's his decision. only he knows.
you got a back door to this place?
aaronow...
jesus, i don't know. you tell me. you're the indian.
bob's upset.
it cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley.
rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
it's a letter from the school . . . from miss stewart.
francesca. robert.
i'm not everybody.
i don't care about the team.  i care about the school.
he's not finished.
great. on my fucking room.
-- is not my boyfriend.
it's fun dancing with your eyes closed. i'm floating. i'm floating... .
huh?, sir.
it's gone too far.
i don't like to interfere.
no...it's nothing to do with you. it's just that i was scared of coming back. now, after all these years, i thought i was strong, that i had forgotten lots of things. instead, i find it's quite the opposite, as if i had never left. and yet, i look at lia and feel as if i didn't know her, and you, mamma...i abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
i was told that he did not die at once.
some call it resilience. others, stupidity.
well sir, i am a great admirer of yours, and i have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. would you let my wife and i take you to have dinner tonight? our treat.
like you've got a grip.
ken, it's bruce. listen, we've got a nibble on the pendleton financing.
thanks.
wait -- i must figure it up.  first, i'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in england in march, i'll need a suit... you'd want me to look nice?
yes, i think we could all use a good laugh.
right...she married...what was he?
do you get high, sam?
yeah, eddie was a real character.  had these girls cooked the rocks he called the rockettes.
he wants me to break a leg?
i don't know.  i think so.  i feel very strange.
no momma.
the words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. i won't be long.
what'd he say?  where's the hand- off?
these things you're talking about. you did them to jerry?
damn... alright then.
sure. what do you want me to call you?
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  and piss you off.
don't go, susan.
so there are others?
well, of course. we always welcome friends.
elijah who?
what do we have to do?
it depends on the condition of the ship.  if i could get to one of the suit compartments i could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
how could i? i'm helping you clean up mark's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george?
hurry.
unprofessional.
yes, sir.
i want to talk to you.
i didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. he owes me.
the eradicators!
he's an actor, so it can't be good.
it's only insurance.  can't be too careful.  this terry valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  they were together how long?
well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
you'll stand by me?
as in...?
i live with it every minute of every day.
caitlin's on the same wave-length?
you love him?
shut up.
inside the sphere.  look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  there's no head, so i'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
what happened to all the gatorade?
your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
i'm sorry for the woman, fettes. but her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  as for me, fettes, i let no man stop me when i know i'm right -- when i know that i need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  and if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as i see it.
but the motion passed. it's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
like a detective.
everyone just kind of looked the other way.
be a sport. how bad could spring break in los angeles be?
look sean, i don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- i don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! but don't you dare undermine what i'm trying to do here.
you ruined my life.
scream.
that's total bullshit. you can find death omens anywhere you want to.
you're wasting your time, blade.  the flechette's a dud.
any time.
you haven't told him?
shit.
that's not the point. frances farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. no. no, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
well, she's back to earth now. they're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. i think you better go back, kid.
dave, it's going to be okay.  just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  i guarantee it.
a car ... a car accident.
you call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local democratic headquarters--tell me, harry, why should i be smiling?
i don't know.
those bastards at universal.  i made so much money for them, and now i can't get the time of day.
this is the hotel supervisor, mr lamont. i’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
what do you want?
yeah.
hi.  are you... busy?
get out of here!
isn't that rather too close...?
after dinner, you and i will take shifts throughout the night. i don't want to chance miss anything.
they'll all be fine.  who better to get the children through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert?
if i don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
i'll try, captain.
quick.  very quick.
i said--shall we get started *now* or--
sometimes we have to improvise.
relax.  i've flown with my old man a million times.  and he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor. how did that happen to a non-party member?
you saw it?
i'm sorry, sir, but i must insist.
i -- i will write to the press -- here -- and in england.  and i will use the courts.
it's not a village. there's nothing there.
a letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
what money?
traveling light. i like that.
she wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
you just go when i say go.
yes.
good day!
to the penny.  exactly one million dollars in cash.
asshole, can't talk.
i still don't think it's loaded.
yes. where is he?
thank you.
yes -- how about dorothy?
yes!
it's all right. hey, it's all right. we'll be right here, right with you.
...what?
how did you know that?
yeah.
so i was right.  that's nice to know...
no, i do not think so.  i don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
you just drove a fucking customer away, barry.
it's just another case, sailor.
aw, come on. you know you love me. you're a masochistic pain freak. you <u>gotta</u> love me.
listen, i don't care who lives in there; all as i know it's got to be preferable to death by hatchet.
you're mad.
and that i can drive a truck!
i thought you'd heard a trillion times --
fletch?
did he?
how much have you got?
at 7:30 sunday morning?  it's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
i want to lie low till i get the whole dope.  i don't want to go off half-cocked.
tomorrow -—
so what.  we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that.  no such thing as bad publicity.  so what.  earlier you said singing and dancing.
un sapo?
dade.
yes, i think i amused them.  to what do i owe...?
yeah, it's kinda nice.
tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
too young?
yes, i do.
okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. does that clarify the situation?
that's good. keep it at forty.
i just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
you think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
you want to hear about destiny? if my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, i would never have been on that flight to miami, and met rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
in many ways, that obnoxious creep cactus was the worst one of all. he got off on giving out pain...
you think you can make me tell! but i won't! i won't! i won't!
he didn't offer you money.
you nervous? new town, new school. i know it must be pretty hard for you...
nobody. it was closed.
why, why did you start this in the first place, man? they never hurt you.
they have six tentacles.  a new species.  and the squid too.  they had no stomach.
cut that shit out.  maybe before, but not now. i want to help you. i'm on your side.
he knows.
you know the thing i love about mustangs? the steering wheel.
is that so? what's the wonderful news?
mhravitch.
it's nothing.  will you trust me?
sssh.  that's what i'm taking care of. they need a letter of permission.
where?
why?
818-753-0088.
it's a bitch.
this is the president.
he's completely lost touch with reality.
four days ago.
oh.
why?
well, i'm really pleased to hear a confession.
oh -- no way.  i can't do that to her.
there's nothin' to figure out. i'm home... we're workin' it out.
yeah, you know when bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'i'd kiss you, but...'
i am not responsible for your assumptions.
yes.
i said, i've seen it before.
how long were you and eduard --
my true name is ss'tangya t'ssorentsa'.
very pleased you've taken him in, david.  at a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
i've questioned him.
she's not talking. but, she could be. so, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
honey?
you made me hurt him!
penny.  i'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
you'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. people have patterns. they do more or less the same things every day. i can tell.
it was no big deal.  i saw them leave, i went in.
oh, all right. come here, grandad.
no -- impressed.
no one's coming to get you.  not while i'm around.
yes.
i'm not gonna let it go. the man needs to explain himself. makin' promises.
it must be serious, swana. not long ago i'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. now i can say it without stammering, without a blush. i'm in love, swana.
yeah, for now.  our first priority's to get something to breathe.
just be patient with me, shu lien.
are you out your mind?  i'm not messing with them s.a.'s boy.  you must be crazy.
hey, hey! i'm eating here!
yeah, i'm real glad you brought that up.  i was going through your file here, and i ran into these medical records.  they kinda surprised me --
he did have pointed ears.
it couldn't have gone better. it's practically set.  of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
well, they're old.  i saw the shit that they were giving you.
john, if you don't throw me the keys, then i'll just walk away. walk away and leave you here.
twenty five?
another dab?
dr. lecter -
i'm calling the police.
just a crank making phone calls. happens a dozen times a day at the office.
the little man in my...  ...head...
you touch anything, mike?  pick up anything?  use the doorknob?  i don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. if we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
shhhhh....tony. rest, rest.
can you eat it?  if you can't eat it i really don't care what it is.
your parents' wake. rain fell like tears.
we're going for a little liquid refreshment.
what?
hey, nick! god damn!... what've you been doin', i mean...
yup.
alexander... i know you.
in case of what?
no.
listen...
what about the life readings you picked up?
i am not john wayne.  there is no "s" on his chest.  we get down if the play calls for it.  but we are into business and making money.
are you crazy?
the blood is still there.  we just gotta figure out where.
now some people, we both know them, al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  but a man doesn't cry.  i don't cry.  you don't cry ... you fight!
they won't let you in without one.
go on!
me too.  i was afraid.
no.
the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. come on.
let’s go.
oh, the usual things...
we gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
the way she looked at me, ramona! she hates me now. i think i've made a great mistake. she's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
i don't know, shit.  maybe she was looking for love...
you want me to tell her for you?
yeah.  i want to tell you everything.
deep.
you know my friend maureen? her son, the investment banker? he paid for her entire retirement in boca raton. what a mench he is. instead of schleping to save hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an mba. maybe then you could send me to boca, too.
there's been a break in.  lock this door and stay here.  don't move a muscle.
lizard dna and human dna on the same strand?  impossible.  the sample must be contaminated.
you're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
a little weak today.
no, it's ok...you came in early.  besides, you're creating an incident. when people are applauding they don't order anything.
what?
i want you to spend some time with me.  i want you to try and make this relationship work.  if not, i'd rather not be bothered.
do you really need these?
don't worry, mr. dickson. we'll find out whether he's telling the truth. i'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
what if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
is that what you think of me? i believe in the grail, not the swastika.
comin' over coldwater.  goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  you believe that?
through a wound on his stomach?
no.
yes.
you mean when are you going to egypt?
hey, donny --
no, i don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
hey, fuckball, i don't need your permission. l.a.'s an open city.
come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
i love you dad.
you don't know that for sure.
yes, sister?
janine, i'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
yes, i'm with the underhills.
i told 'em about it. they know i'm well. that mizz wheatley made me some biscuits.
there you go with that we again.
ruiz knows about this?
--fund that was used to gather information against the democrats--
sure. fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
say it in english.
why do you hurt me, michael?  i've always been loyal to you.
i just struck it rich... i think we can do a little business.  as a matter of fact, i think we can have a party.
i'm not worried. you're not worried, are you. professor tripp?
first of all, it’s never out of the blue. and second of all--
why not?
is it weird?
but i'm seeing him.
i hope i didn't hear that.
trouble with the car again?
hey, screw you! okay? you think i'm just somebody you can buy off! listen, let me tell you something--
you just haven't been looking.
unzip my pack, yo.
these are my people now. i'm one of them.
call me crazy, but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. what else? you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
i already have a boyfriend, nick.
creed's great, ain't he... i'll do what i can.
what the fuck is he talking about?
i mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
but what if andy gets another dinosaur?  a mean one?  i just don't think i can take that kind of rejection.
a word of caution, sire: we all remember what happened to robespierre, danton and marat. put the marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
adrian -- you've lost it.
okay. two of 'em. both had my father. it's peculiar. i'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. so in a sense he's the younger man. anyway, first one i don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and i think i lost it. the second one, it was like we was both back in older times and i was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
the sand.
i don't know, sir.  but they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. war just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
yes, minister, i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain galgenstein.
yes -- i think so.  another crossed line?
ain't jemima on the pancake box?
well, i guess i got it wrong, then. seems to me i heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
what are you going to do?
yes.
put down lex luthor?
get a good picture in your mind.
have they nothing to fear presently?
we'll work it out...
seven.  really.
why?  i just read your report card.  what's the point?  stay home, watch some television, we'll get "mad" magazine delivered.  what kind of report card do you call this?!
i'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
you got us all worked up.
no you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
i know, i know.
look mr denham - you're not welcome here. just pack up your cameras and go.
a woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  a drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  and, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  that's the point.  you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  and we tolerate it. because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  not anymore.  i'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
you don't have to explain. did i tell you how grateful i am for what you've done?
three of our classmates are dead. that's not really the occasion for a party.
don't play innocent with me bazza; spanking!
look! just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! that's the only way you're going to live.
maybe we can just watch some tv.
he's my friend, too.
gable. why a feller like that don't come east to do a play...
he'd never seen a corpse.  he's seen a dozen now.
i am sorry.  sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  it's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
it's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
mmm. wal, me, i just enjoy maikn' things up. yessir. escape... it's when i can't write, can't escape m'self, that i want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. mm...
why
how did i get stuck with you as a moving buddy?
i love you.
still is, so let yourself out.
how?
yes, sir.
good. i'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
oh, charles is hardly ever with me. first it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. what do people call you -- pete?
who is she? where does she live?
i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
well don't worry about it. my stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. she won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red m&ms. hope you're ready.
how the hell would you know?
more or less.  son, i'm sorry. they got us.
you... you'd send me back, wouldn't you? you would.
i don't know what to do, walter.
what other one?
marcus, i'm tired. that's all.
trust you? i may seem a little goofy at times, but i'm not a complete bozo, you know.
scientific american?  really?
i'm sorry.
did i?  or was that you?  when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  terrified.  like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  you did that, norman.
<u>am</u> <u>berliner</u> <u>zug</u>.
you don't have any other choice.
what?
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
guy's the toxic avenger.
could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
but wasn't it funny?
hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
yeah.
you're sometimes not sure?
daphne, you're bothering us.
he made up those rules, and we're working for him.
fifteen minutes ago. why don't i go in and wait?
uh huh?
sure you are.  you're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
lula tell you she's pregnant?
i have expectations, too.
he has to look here or i won't get a clear shot.  call him, margo.
ah, conor, how you look a man.
i'll pick you up at your place.  i'll bring along the roylance guide -- we can read after we eat.
... so mom. truly no grudges -- truly. a little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard i was hurt, but the important thing i want you to know is your son is happy. i'm working again. i'll make do -- i don't want a thing. wouldn't take it if it was offered. i'll drop you a note from wherever i land and then it's up to you. i hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, i wish you both the very best... i can't hear you. you heard me, though, right? good -- take good care. 'bye.
did you forget where i live? it's four o'clock.
the corruther's house. that's where jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
your conversation has one marvelous advantage, swana. however many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
is it a great man whom gray can order to his bidding? is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that i must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
i'm scared. three kids are dead. i want to go to this party.
what?  what was that crazy bitch said to him?  there's a war on, man! people are being killed!
uh... sure...
going nearer to god!
hi, leonard.
this isn't funny, it's twisted.
kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
hey lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
shut your hole, slutnik.
i'm going to leave now. do you want a lift?
do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
i love the fact you brought shakespeare with you and no clothes. ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. is that true?
no.
you better go get dwight and the professor.
no, i better stay at my post.
i was born in new york city. i grew up. and here i am.
that's okay?
it can wait.  anything else?
the who?
a monster?
then what are you complaining about?  look, we have work to do. when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "first, the breath of god. only the penitent man will pass. second, the word of god, only in the footsteps of god will he proceed. third, the path of god, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
what the fuck?
holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  so that's what it was.  a fucking robbery.  so why nuke the building, hans?
i don't see why i should mind.
i'll look for it.
you didn't do that badly.
don't i always?
got it ben.
do you sail?
a man might what?
so some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
what?  you're not going to wait for me?
time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
max.
but that's impossible!! george asked her out! he had to! i saw him walk her home! oh, god!
david?
there's no hurry! the race is over!
albert... albert and ethel. why?
that's not very logical, lester.
oh, thank you, herr rick. sacha will be happy to hear it. i owe him money.
no complaints.
after torpedo room:  report!
i'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
that goddamn neanderthal? i'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! did you know that?!
it's peggy to these eyes.  same nose, same hair.  plus buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
the last resort!  quick!
lula... i learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show i heard on the radio... how leeches is comin' back into style.
larry sellers, a high-school kid. real fucking brat.
what do you think?
you got me mad, that's why. hey, joe, show marty that picture.
real 'quality-timers,' hugh.
maybe you can.
and this is legitimate therapy?
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out.
i signed-up for the stock option.
none in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
now this is important. make sure you leave the house when you make the call. you understand? do you hear me? it's important.  call from an outside phone. i mean it.
how serious is the damage?
that's a very personal question.
yes, sir.
goin' out.
pull over.
oh, just a routine mammogram. she said to say hello. she's going to positano with your brother's family.
it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air.  in fact, i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
the world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  a man has to make up his own life, alone.
tatum!
well, you better move holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
we're going to do this.
i like well your conceit, jack.  tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
this is pathetic.
i didn't hit shit!
no but you didn't defend him either! didn't want to rock the boat.  guess the ride was too smooth. filmore i was acting under legal counsel!
well, no one ever spit in my face before. especially some cracker fuck.
i . . . mexico.  you got a bus that goes to mexico?  that's where i have to go.
he killed them?
it's not family.  it's business.
what time is it there?
what class?
is it that hopeless?
which is why he doesn't need us.
who then?
look, i don't know what's up there.
actually i'm feeling up to leaving.
nothing wrong with research.
of course not.  but she's have to know eventually.
no, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. a thing like that. no. sure you don't want a sip of this? it's delicious, i think.
oh, a baron! 
that man -- who is he?
thank god!
helen hudson...
what is it?
where the hell are they going?
you're...such a wimp.
i appreciate your gentlemanliness, bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
no - i've got a sweet-payin' job that i'm about to lose.
that's it. that's the end.
did you kill him?
gag on your own invention, then.
that is exactly what i'm afraid of.  the girl has got to go, darlin'.
taste it.
don't do anything more. i'll find out what i can.
78th.
tell eve? you mean mrs. rand?
hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
lieutenant doolittle, i'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
that is not true, mrs. ayala.  your route is compromised.  perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california.
it'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how america came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
went home to shit.
okay... maybe that would be best.
show you?
doyle.  joey doyle's... .?  ... .you're his... .
it's my head, i'll be the judge of that. anyway, who are you?
oh, yeah.  listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
it's the right thing to do.
get buckets!
oh, yeah?  well, you're not handcuffed to him.  anybody in the back room?
and harems ... ?
and you like them?
ah-hah. it would be best if he waited here.
did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
it's going famously, son, famously!
what's this, sir?
sure --
i gotta go along with mr. pink on this. i've seen it happen.
great!  how's it going?
i don't know.
wait, i want to check something. give me a hand.
look, it's important.
how did you know?
chairman mao can keep china. just give us back tibet.
if it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
that we did.  thanks to you.  he was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
doesn't matter.
tracks ?
yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
no.
birth control.
it's an interesting story, wendy. many years ago in the late 1800's, james mertin, an irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
yes, i have mine.
tell me -- let me help --
no, we have to get this story.
if there is anything else, don't hesitate --
but he was called...
nick, we can't just --
'our revels now are ended.'
where's that?
rich? i have an inheritance. it's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. that's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. this is what i'm doing with that money. i could have done anything i wanted. i could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
yeah?
lamar --
yes--thanks. i'm louis creed.
i'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
i don't care about rocks, i care about <u>you</u>.  you bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being best man.
at an operation?
yes.  throw it in.
i do not accept.
raising money is tough.
bye, adam!
it was my father's.  kept it in his wallet.  he was murdered --
and that's what you've heard?
what -
they say sex is great for cramps.
ah, father... you are so wrong. let me explain...
about what?
well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
don't know on a map. west told us it was there, we just found it. maybe the hurricane took it away.
a broadway shopping bag.
it's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when i was consigliere to sonny.
they'll probably move at dawn.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
no shit.
fuck you.  this is bullshit.  i'm outta here.
wow.
you've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  how come you always save me for last, james? when are you gonna learn.  shit don't happen i don't know about.
it's good you want to do something, george.
it's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
hi, mary. how's it going?
yes.
au revoir.
i had a better idea, we'll burn them. there's a drum across the road; i was just waiting for the workers to go home.
-- you could have the stamps. i'll get you some here, okay?
groovy. smashing! good on ya!  nice tie. yea capitalism!
well... ok...
i'm serious.
yeah.
it was you... that night in the tunnels. you. you did this to me.
that's interesting, because i didn't leave a message.
you seem like you're anything but lazy, uncle billy.
i can't feel a thing, hon.
but those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after deborah ann kaye's...
uh,  yeah.  we're old friend*
you're in kinship?
oh.
sweet, then? like the pastry?
splendid, love to see them.
oh, yah? twin cities?
on whose authority, corporal ?
it's good.  let him go.
they're paramedics.  they wait at 180 feet.
frankie ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
i'll by that, son.  now, you owe me a favor.  be good to my kid sister...
i have to see how things are first. my father's sick, you understand? they wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
not a prayer.
yes.
why am i here?
phone's out.  road's out.  we're on our own.
what's your name?  we both know it's not nicholai.
i know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
sit down, frank.
come here.
..sorry...
i thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
remember this.  and remember it always.  i'm proud of you.  and i love you too, son.
not good.
thank you.
ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  you must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  you can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
there were 24 kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days. four a day. what do you think about that, mr. creasy?
well--i'll go to halifax!
man, why're you talkin' about larry?  his business is his business.
i didn't protect him, lady. he trusted me. and i didn't protect him... his father...i lost his father to the streets and now, chuy...
look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
no, louise, you said the first part. i said all the rest.
and only talked about killing manzetti to convince them you were an anti-semite. if you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
he's my teacher!
you scorpios can never take a joke.
yawp!
eh?
you mean profanity. that's simply the way they talk here. nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. you'll find it in all the literature of the period.
he's just a deep sleeper.
i didn't do anything. i mean, i didn't order you or anybody...  i only told andy stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
if you wouldn't mind...  it was on sale.
seemed fine. quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
mad? i'm i'm... disgusted!
yes?
no, no -- jenny used to work as a waitress.  before she met him.  but that's not where she met me.  not in my restaurant.
hey...hey...it's okay!
that's what i told them.
we'll have to satisfy them. what would you say to giving them a joint interview? i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
where are you going now?
south dakota...  did i do something unsatisfactory, sir?
i know there's an explanation.
put your guns on the table...  if we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in miami. we wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
no. you listen.  i had my doubts about you from the beginning
before?  where?  where had you been?
i met a presidential aide once at a social occasion.
for a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  who knows?  it sure could have.  i'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
it's just filthy. people are dirty. i think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. i think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... oofh... dirt...
well . . . i better make myself a bit more presentable.
i suppose guinness will suffice.
he's got sergeant halloran in there.  he'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
your daddy played.  i asked, down at the japanese community center. you smoke cigars?
oh, my goodness!
that's good. at least they're interested.
very funny...
i love my job.  i love it.  the next time i'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and i'll get over it.
you know what the word glimpse means, j? it’s by nature an impermanent thing.
well what does he want?
*that means i don't run nirdlinger's!*
not bad, huh?
i've come to understand that...  an ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
what do you make of this?
the right nostril.  good.
yeah kay, i'm here.
what about a battered woman's shelter? you can move you kid in with you.
i'm gonna be on tv! just like diane sawyer.
most imposters are --
he needed my help.
i only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
fuck dat.  the time is fuckin' now. y'know i'm sorry 'bout sal's famous pizzeria, but i gotta live, too. i gotta get paid.
for me?
what? -- i... 
aged eighteen years.  why don't you get the glasses.  behind the bar.
of course... now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
i do.  but you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
i don't believe you.
head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. then left at the blowscreen. you can't miss it.
we got through two states already.
what about keith?
of course you have not! i have not written it!
there is no scam! i've got a fucking sign on my back! i can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. you get it? it's over. we walk.
i love you, adam.
right here.
damned if i know.
that's not a burn.
so that was it.
i thought i could do it. i was so damn sure of myself. but i didn't know what to say. the words wouldn't come. my mouth turned to mush. you make it look so easy, roper. but it is not. it's not easy.  it's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
i'd rather not...
buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the professor!
yes, sir.
and we have found each other nothing will ever change that! i am your family, dear child, but i may not be your home.
<u>cheyenne</u>! what cheyenne?
yeah. i... i fell asleep. i can't believe it. i --
don't say that.
but i might not have.
cool out.  i ain't about to get blasted.
look, if you want to kill jews on your free time, fine. we need you to raise money. will you do that for us?
to jonas.  i didn't know that at the time.  didn't know who he was.  but i knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  so i started watching your father.  i wanted to keep him safe.
there's a dead body in the exhibit! people are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
who're you?
you're an investor, is that it?
but why all nudes?
it's me you want.  not her.
yeah, right, i'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... do you know the cook's chicken franchise?
at the ruins. they're very ancient, you know.
i just don't want to go.
bobby laid his own tracks.  he could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. and as far as i'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  now take the money.
i need a break.  i've been on a marathon run ever since i had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
'n daniel webster will be there.
what are you hunting, mr. sayer?
i never *seen* her so sassy.  an' she ain't so young, neither!
murderer?  really?
where are you?  i been trying to reach you.
i tried to tell him the whole story, but riedenschneider stopped me. he said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave...
really? i'd like to find out.
um... not exactly. but i've been honest. i haven't told her i'm available. and she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. besides...
like ahh... i don't know...  five thousand dollars.
tavis, thank you for having me.
yes...
no...
what for?
eh, if the bootie fits...
what?
erica? she said she was tired. she went back to the hotel.
i'm moving out.
it's good to see you.
it might behoove us to turn back at this point.
emergency procedures.
got word the kids are moving through texas... i think an ending is being arranged there... come on, lemme see a smile.
sure, mikey.
foley made me think of that fella carl tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  you recall that?
do you want to come to argo city?
yes, baron.
and who might that be?
well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, i might ...
we can just take this pillowcase.
all right.
no, siree, it didn't. and it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and union. so --  giddyap, constitution -- and let's keep going, mr. stone.
what will happen if i do?
it's her 18th birthday, i want to show her off.
noooo!
how?
what are you then?  what will you be ten years from now?  still cutting lawns?  still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
ronnie! how are you? you work here now?
yes. i think so, too.
i've seen enough. turn it off.
i apologize, i just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
she's also moorish.
it is and i don't.  ordinarily...  but, i mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
page 32. "deputy dewey filled the room with his dim-witted barney fifish presence." i think you've explained yourself.
we ain't bad men no more, bill. hell, we're farmers.
well, that's because he's the devil. and he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of hell, causing my dad...
that's a nice teapot.
i think we're through for the night.
steve, i'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until i tell my brother...
possibly false. hence the ima record of being lost at sea. i don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
when it comes to her, i don't trust nobody. i'm askin' you somethin'.
a bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
no way.
ok, i bite. what does it look like?
do i seem jumpy?
then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
thought so.  turned out he wanted me for something else though.
i could use the money.
gladly caesar.
them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
why would you want to be a cop?
yes....
campari and soda would do nicely.
we must do something.
you dying.
the longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, mr. president.
gloria golden?
name's hammond, reggie hammond. i heard a lot about you. and any friend of jack's is a friend of mine.
say what?
got any last minute advice?
nowhere. you just sit here and... eat.
i've been preoccupied.
yup.  oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  solid, solid novelty act.
it's three.
he gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
it's not so much what you say but how you say it.  women like men who are unpredictable.
if he files are you going to take the case?
must've been hard being poor.
honey, is something wrong?
you really went and did it.  with one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  nobody does it better, hudson.  you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex.
because i don't like you.
big talk.
baby, please, please --
what do you think was wrong?
no.
i guess not.
prayin', brother. prayin'.
what shape is the scar?
i haven't laid a hand. on my life, r.l., my wick is dry on this.
man like you ought not take the lord's name like you just done.
you're not listening. your heart is not. love is deaf as well as blind.
nah.
what needs clearing up?
right.  but there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  the sins are in a different order.
you gonna tell me who it was?
the manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
respect me a little then. i'm the only life you know.
this isn't flying.  this is falling -- with style!
well, professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? you know, changing the course of history and all....
how come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
it's about time. isn't fun great?
mm.
goddamn, goddamn! how did he die?
i don't know.  i'm not sure.
he sees betrayal everywhere. he will attack us so long as he is conscious.
so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  you think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
pull up next to him!
tell me about kip -
me?  after sugar?
huh? oh, yeah.
look, no way i'm lettin' you out there.  in a half hour you could be in canada.
you got my word on it.
i'm not, uh, i'm not arguin' here. i'm cooperating... there's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
you can't. so tell me what you do know -- say it!
nobody told me anything.
that's fine.  it's nice to meet you.
nice to run into you again.
did he promise?
this is your aunt.  carlotta mayfair.  in new orleans.
i would never marry anybody i didn't love.
where'd you learn all this stuff?
then that's it!
ok. bye.
she can take care of herself. she doesn't need you.
yes, please.  i'm looking for all beef patties.
about thirty minutes.  those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
in a minute...
and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego. you asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: mr hale-fellow-well-met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. they called, they demanded money...
sometimes i have serious doubts about you.
will you come with me?
indeed.
i can't. otherwise, i would.
she was there, wasn't she?
there's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  come on.
my god.  murdered?  -- what's this have to do with rorschach?
the same thing i suppose.
why?
i've read of it.
marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
holy shit!
marty...
do you have a boyfriend?
plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
what about school?
good...yuppie piece of shit.
well, why is that up to me? you're the one who's married. you told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
i think you're right, it would be harder on her. but you'd better call mr. hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
i know that.
oh, brother...
that's what i said.
i should have done this a long long time ago.
his car's still there.
go!! just go!!
i dunno, sir. brought you up a chevy.
stop it --
go you huskies...
they've gone to a better place.
it was perfect.  the harder i pushed, the more you pulled away.
they're coming.
forget about us.  just save rachel.
the date.
she doesn't know.
wearing them?  or humping them?
man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. big goddamn deal.
what about finding the source?
that's it, ray.  i've had it.  no more parties. i'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
there's a part of a scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
no way.
she's really a fox, isn't she?
have any other people ever passed through?
thanks, man.  i've been hating myself for the last two days.
it's blue. blue velvet.
it makes me sick to see him like that.
deploy.
nix?
yeah?
yes mr. lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these.
the speech? real good.
gave you?  well now, i wouldn't quite put it like that...
yes, i speak. and read. and think... and know the ways of man.  i've been waiting for you. two months now.
well, you are his grandfather. he is supposed to spend some time with you. you're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
there’s more. your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000.
but you found another choice.
no radio or tv...
dave schapiro is no horse doctor and rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. to call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing i ever heard in my life.
because i like to torture you.
who is this madame sconce? let's find her and talk to her.
they took over a club i was working at.  caesar started managing it.
is he dead?
i wasn't. i wasn't. she was the pretty one. she died, why not me?  i never said my morning prayers. and i was ugly, i was scrawny, i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, sister mary clitus, called me polkadot livingston.
i don't know... jackie?
if you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
this is a league game.  this determines who enters the next round- robin, am i wrong?
yes. i mean, no. i mean, maybe he would find her, i mean you attractive. maybe he doesn't like to dance. maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
jabez! careful --
very early. dawn.
you looked okay.  joint's pretty dead. how 'bout i take you home?
no!
yes, sir?
i'll say.
that doesn't say a thing about t-rex, they could have been rogues.  robert burke certainly thinks they were.
ok, last night i was weak. it won't happen again. and all that shit i said--it was just because i was stoned. forget it.
they're going to walk right past me.
just try to understand what we're dealing with here. don't underestimate it.
i'm sure i don't know who you mean.
it speaks!
it's my birthday.
including landy...  she had access to the archives.
scar?
it's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
it's difficult to... on our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
i don't know. i'm just a d.a. i don't have access to all you expert sources.
i'm a little worried --
my love is no lie. i have a wife, yes, and i cannot marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps. it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that. and yet you let me come to your bed.
i know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
i'm not scared.
that ain't gonna work.
i am sort of scattered.
struggling, why?
roger.  you better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
i don't understand. living....selection is computed. you can't... what have you done to luh?  she was here..
home. watching tv.
lines around the block.
do you intend to marry, my lord?
here. behind you.
no gas... hey, that's good.
fats, i got about two hundred dollars here.
i'm fine.
no. no. get carol.
you gotta keep lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  and no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
and that's exactly what i'm talkin' 'bout.
i been thinking. i hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
sapphire!
is this your new dress suit?
those, over there, there.
to keep it away from them?  no pirate would sail to london, for fear of execution dock.
yes he is.
she died.  her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  what is this about?
divide and conquer.
it says, "ray."
okay.
mookie, i don't know what you're talking about, plus i don't want to hear it.
and the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from ambrose.
in the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  when they're having sex.
when?
yes.
they guys treatin' you all right?
you okay?
but i am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
you didn't visit him in prison.
permission to speak candidly, sir?
vasquez, take point.  let's move.
then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
the professor asked me for it -- i thought it was for something scientific!
so was i. so don't give me any shit. your business is just as bad. at least i'm up front about it. you kill people slowly. your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. now you know how it feels.
i brought you something ... from the library.
i've got about five thousand left in cash, but i'll need another thirty, if you approve.
well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. you'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. super string theory, chaos math, advanced algorithms--
everything is everything.
and what happens when all hell breaks loose?
nice guys finish last. first rule of the jungle.
only that floor.
no.
that's not even --
i'm doing it.
then again, that's easy for me to say, since i'll never even get a date. i'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
what?
doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
no.
everything's okay? 
you know who i am.
uh-huh.
they do in chinatown.
we'll just say where we are then go back to the car we don't want to be any worry.
yes -- you are right, mary. i can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- all the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
i wish there was shit like this back home.
oh, thanks.
yeah?
but you spoke to him on the phone.
but it's not	the money, vlad.
what do they have to do with this?
come on.
that doesn't mean i don't like hearing it.
probably. she's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
you sure do a lot of guessing.
this is one way.
i'm sure he's busy.
we haven't build shit.  you're just tearing down your father.
lay down, day-day.  stop moving.
...the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars...
keep him here. i'm going for a bag.
why's he called 'invisible'?
fuck how they operate. just do it. like your man says, "by any means necessary."
got it.
i'm calling her!
according to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...marcus halberstam.
yes?
i'm sorry, mr. white, but i've got an errand to run.
show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
i'm home from school. my father's in the hospital.
yes?
what's that, written on the sail?
who are you?
why are you saying that? [beat] we don't have long, do we?
yes.
i wasn't going to call her. not after the way she was.
haven't felt it a bit. been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
let's just try the first part. if that goes well, we'll see about the rest. no one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
so i got the state lookin' for a ciera with a tag startin' dlr.  they don't got no match yet.
i said i saw you last night. what were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
yes. very nice. have you met my granddaughter, lizzy? she takes care of me.
great!
no.  my old lady must have made a lot of promises.
it wasn't professional, jack.  it was a stunt. a stupid-ass stunt.
if the japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. sheila steps over to the booth with their food. the buzz burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
how much time?!
and why are you wearing that silly costume?
i came down here to close a deal for studebaker.
boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
now?
i'm sorry...?
utopia is lost to me. my daughter is gone.
let's wait on the power cells.
we're not used to the big city. where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
there are no answers. there's either jason bourne alive or jason bourne dead. and i for one would prefer the latter. and what about her?  you just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
you believe that?
my father left me the business.
that?
i will.
i was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  oh, elly, honey, a cat.  here?
then someone was in with you.  who was it? -- who was it?  i'll answer that --  hello ...  hello ...
you're the nastiest dirtbag i know in this stinking city!
i'd be trying to get the best deal that i could.
everybody still up on the island?
no problem. she can have it. i hate mountains.
i've got something for you.
from the belltower the day she before she died.
what are you doing with all these blueprints?
shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
you fucking...
yep.  i want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
i will -- i assure you that -- you got a fifty on that h-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- i'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
yeah... it could be fun.
er, no...
believe me i know.
didn't you know?
company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
where's sid?
whatever you do, don't do that.
again
she cannot possibly refuse.  her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  and along with the invitation, the king sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
what's the profile?
it's okay. no problem. where should we sit?
a what...?
where?
and all's fair in love and war?
why not?
i thought you said we had an hour, sir?
we do.
and how does *'local girl'* janet majors fit into the scheme of things?
we can <u>ram</u> him!
no. it's you who doesn't understand, aud. halfdan has come to kill and destroy. we brought him here. we must stop him.
we've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna. and we want you to be our guide.
okay, we need wallpaper paste.  hey cece!
who is...
the ride is free.
what d'you mean, i just opened it for you? this is <u>french</u> champagne.
i'll do what i can, if she'll let me.
i thought we all were.
i kept thinking about it, what you said... i hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
well yes, what did you think this was all about?  fun and games?
civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
sort of.
we saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
will you shut up already?
for christ's sake, why not?
well, that's very reasonable. howe i hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
what do i exude?
i know you do.
i don't know.
well, then, what's the hurry? is it true the rights to "doctor zhivago" are in arbitration?
one thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
i made you, and i can destroy you.
it's the same way with cars. different cars. different tunes. you can't steal a maserati listening to sinatra. you gotta get urgent. you gotta get sonny rollins or led zeppelin iv, on that shit. but never, never-ever take no allman brothers into a lincoln town car. could lead to disaster. got it... ?
but, why?
deliver this package.  then, i dunno.
wait a minute.  he was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
but why?
god i'm hungry.
how's it going?
just a guess.  but i think found a nest.
how could you?
how could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  it's dead.
answer me when i talk to you. what happened that night?
thanks.
flanking riders?
this is eve harrington.
what do you want?
show's over unless i get to see what you've been working on after hours.
tradition.
laurie!  good to see you.
jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
shhhhh.
i sometimes fade out.
oh god, tommi...
don't think i won't.
i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that. i mean, i don't mean i'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... i'm such a loser. every time i come to a party i tell myself i'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod.
nah. couldn't be.
hi. i'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
all right, tell us, rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
i heard about thorkel's order--
what's the matter, you don't know this trick?
but not quite.
and you've got me all figured out?
why?
yeah, i-i think you're pretty lucky i came along.
no. what had you better--?
yes, mr. brett--right away.
he comes from a large family.
the trunk.  it's locked.
who ?
in my mother's drawer.
this "denial of death". you remember this?
nobody's as evil as my brothers. those dudes put the wick in wicked.
it's a rule. always stand by your first count. the odds are you're right.
there are sick people who need our help. here and now. not in some future time. consider that.
you got a better idea?
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
months.
isn't that nice. since when?
he's right, les.
it's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
must have opened while i was away at school.
when did you make this, walter?
it's never happening again. right?
i didn't know her.  the body i took knew her.  the man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  i - uh - took him.
i did, terrance, i learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
steady!!...  now, mr. sulu!
i'm not much of a reader, but i do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  mostly non-fiction.  did you read the new styron?
does that surprise you?  it was inevitable.
mrs. hillyer, i don't know who he is, i really don't.
what?
...but an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  three times a day -- anything!
i know.
i wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me i'd do.
the army kicked you out for drugs...
i just want to be alone.
you're kidding?
death to dragons!
i'm here.
is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
should be.  it's yours.
it was planted on me, sir.
why's that?
it's terrible.
he ever accept cash for a favor?
go home for the weekend.
sorry.  it's the first time i've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
when did it start?
i do.
i already said that, b...
'bye, johnny...
keep it.
yes. so as soon as zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
what's that?
no problem. oh, boy!
oh my god. is her son ok?
you're sweet.  and sexy.  and completely hot for me.
you didn't have to tell me.
i steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
i guess we each have something the other wants.
there's something i ought to tell you.
eddie, this is quite a scene.
when will you do it?
i'm just going in to do my shopping.
you mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
not at all. it's damned interesting.
about how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
that's more like it.  two more nitrate-sicles please.
my dad plays for the "clippers."  he says i'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but i'ma play for them, too.  same number and everything.
huh.  that was nice of me.
you have to leave -
don't feel bad, mr. luthor. it almost worked. i mean california almost threw up right in the ocean. millions of people almost killed. if it hadn't been for that guy superman - that overgrown boyscout...
dunwitty, don't leave.
yes. might as well - all of it.
as best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
where's the bag she gave you?
 where are my feelings... i feel for no one...
should we knock?
it's not like he's a young man, bobby. he's had time to live. it'd be quick. i mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  i mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
that's right.
yes...i've found that it does.
sent it.
a fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
how is gregor?
no, no ... not "is"!
--and it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. in my official capacity, therefore, i--
i'm coming over.
i'm onto ferrie's cuban paymaster, eladio del valle, in miami.  i gotta get him in, boss.  i need more men - i can't even pull the teams to watch ferrie... this is our case!
i can't believe you did that!
mmmm.  boy. it's hot up here.
your majesty, herr mozart -
it will take them five minutes!  how long ago did they arrive?
hi, kimura. where's the command post?
college. haven't really thought about it.
i didn't ask him to come!  it's like i said, thelma, he just loves the chase.
-- i thought we had secure frequency. aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... fact is, you are gonna pay me, and i am gonna provide you with a service.
on account of me.
take the gun.
what was your father's name?
roger that.
as, what, 'the galloping gladiator?!'
yes.  then he said a really weird thing...
you're narco, lad, not homicide. and since when do you work with edmund?
what?  when?
so are you.  are you shaking?
yes.
i meant him.
names are incredibly intimate. we barely know each other. trust me on this.
my god -- don't you recognize mouton -- our regimental dog?  i would rather eat cossack.
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook?
we'll speak to her, jim...
keeping a stiff upper lip?
i'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols.
dr. hirsch?
we're going to have jackets, aren't we?
oh i thought i'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. or set the house on fire. you know.
fine lloyd.
i saw budgie gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  said, "what are you doin'?"  he said, "i'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. i never had it like you when i was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
get away!
sit down, the lot of you.
a few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, i can't remember.  worse thing is, i never know if it will change back again...  now, please leave me alone.
well, are...are they big?
yes, ma'am.
a couple of guys, i owe them. so, that's what i did. i gave 'em the money.  that's what i did.
as in, the vegetable?
earl, there's just one thing i ought to clear up for the interview.
i told walter.
sherry, sherry...
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
must i administer them directly, or might i blow them?
well...
this is my farm. get on the boat, now ! that's an order, sergeant.
burbage, i will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
give me an example.
that's just another part of the price to pay.
it's one of these. for some reason, cool bars in l.a. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
just do what i say.  now, which nostril are you breathing through?
that dazzling imagination.
yeah.
you ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
then why don't you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing?
that is correct.  lieutenant dunbar, i came to apologize for the accommodations. ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
i haven't had a chance to see him yet. i'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
no, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
it's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language.
where's his father?
good.
miss kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
oh la vache!
you accusing me of extortion?
what do you want?
tell me your name?
dartmouth?!
of course, jeffrey.
i'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
it just so happens we're not in kansas anymore. our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood. she's staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house. can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? it will be my greatest victory.
someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
get this goddamn thing off me!
huh?
you get me out first.
i don't know.
what about the intro?
stop! you're making...mistake.
i said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--i appoint you to the united states senate!
uh-huh.
hello tom. you're off? what are your plans?
whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of lisa sherman, clothes and all. i think that concerns me.
can i see your back?
i want to see you.
no, you're right.  or buddy.  i won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in detroit.  or if you've run into glenn michaels yet.
where's the bathroom?
i don't know. i'm beginning to feel guilty.
you mean that happy child?
now then. face the wall. bend over and touch your toes. chief guard inspects alex's anus with a penlight.
we leave it.
i don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
read it and keep on reading.
you little shit.  when did they get to you?
sure. i remember seeing a book about chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the white house library and the library of congress and--
um-hum!
oh, my, yes.
i know because... it's just something i know.
who?
he's busy.
so there's one around here.
mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'oh my god, i'm your biggest fan!'
how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
nope. his mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  he isn't to consort with his computer friends.  the secret service is really out to get him.  hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
well, that's different.

don't do it, tommy. he's not worth it.
but she hasn't run off, she's been--
geez, mr crane.
thank you.
i had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. everyone should have some mother wit.
bummer metaphor.
yeah.
yah, but i - okay, i would, i'd guarantee ya your money back.
what?
no, no.

the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday. 'cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the king's money back before any body says "boo."
you're talking about real excitement?

we'll be all right.
how about this, if i can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
they got him standing by.
yeah.
no!  do not be sorry!  never be sorry!  the king cares for nothing and for no one!  there are no mistakes when you are king!  what you do is right for every person!  a king has contempt for everyone!
hey!  uh, how do i get back in?
we all do.  but now i understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
oh, jesus christ, mom!  like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  now i have to add, "p.s. my mom's a dyke" too?
when was the last time you used it?
yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?

the horseman.  yes.
you know i don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  where're you?
that's nice, stan.
of course.
is that the queen's request?
it affords him other interesting opportunities.
it's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  you can't run away from it anymore.  look at the order he's doing them... he did three as the boston strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  then he did one like the hillside strang- ler.  and then one as son of sam. to lead us on -- to where and what end?  and he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  injecting windex.  using .44.  playing abba.
oh. i bet by the end he gets something out of it.
sorry.
you don't have to make conversation with me, i'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?

or just plain stupid. you'd think by the twentieth time, i'd have found an alternative method. maybe a more effective one, if you know what i mean.
yeah, they told us this was the best.
running this place for a fella in town. nothing much to speak of.
yeah, screw 'em, huh? pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
no. got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. figure between that and my night work at the bodwins i might be able to put something away for me and mama.
then maybe i should offer it to your daughter...
where is the drug?  where have they taken it?
not good...
you don't know where you are.  you missed the shipping lanes.

whoah, what a day, huh?
i call'em as i see'em, jim.  i'm ruling it inadmissible.
i'm already dead.
yeah.
ninotchka, we are in the magic east, the country of aladdin and his lamp...
i'm shocked.  with a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
what you wouldn't do. it's almost sunrise. it will be the sun or the fire. you said they can kill me. the sun or the fire!
why would i lie to you?
what's your name?
short? it's ended.
not a chance.  remind them that according to the geneva convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
in space, no one can hear you sweat.
you're imagining it.
how did you --
i don't set policy.  you have the key?
aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as mr. and mrs. stew smith. how do you like that?
i--i discussed it with him--yes-- because i--you see, i've always had this camp in mind--but i made no contract with him!
uh... hello?
sorry.
why?
yes?
spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
no. we came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  can you fix it for us?
because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
then tomorrow you will have the pages.
i'll be a minute.

cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
dancin' on razor blades here...

looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job i've --

no, that's really unneces --
real, my ass. it's an overblown game.  anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
there may be a little less trust after your outburst.
if i agree to this, i walk right now?
you know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and i, and i don't like that.
i'm going back tomorrow.

zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. they'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
oh, fuck you! fuck you, sam rothstein!  fuck you!

and all those like you.
wonderful?  it's terrible! terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
i got the ring. <i></i> tonight's the night, herb. tonight's the night.

pots and pans.
you're coming here?
heh heh. we wanna do her now!
yeah, that's why i asked.
any preferences?
well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, i guess.  some of 'em moved away -- los angeles, sacramento, san francisco.  wasn't much to keep 'em here, i expect. and now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
yeah.
and i'm warning you, leo.  don't test me. get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
what's that mean?
mr. scott, the word is given.
oh, i suppose so.
no problem.  in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
what were you doing there? you never told me you were singing with an r and b group.
--fine, later, fine.
are you in trouble with the law?
get a goddamn job, al. you've got a negative attitude. that's what's stopping you. you've got to get your act together. i'll help you.

grace. i'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim, if you feel up to it.
no, i believed her. she was in pretty bad shape. inside and out. but the boys were never formally charged.
you ask them.
but lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
now!
because...i know.
jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about mr. lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? well--that was *you*. someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. this country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! and when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! a little fellow called david walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
you're kidding me.
it's okay..it's okay.
sorry to disappoint.
look, i know this sounds corny, but whenever i feel like i can't go on i...  turn to jesus and he helps me through the problem. call me an anachronism, but -
she'll not come down tonight.
besides, oxnard sucks.

i'd like to believe that i'm not... but i've just never seen any proof. so i just choose not to bother with it. it's, like, i could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. weighing the pros and cons. and in the end, i still wouldn't have any proof. so... i don't even debate it any more. because it's absurd.  i don't want to be alone.  so, does that make me, like, an atheist?
all night.
i'm will.
i knew you would, pal.  a bird in a gilded cage, eh?
i'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, otho.
then who's the banker?
my thomas is a little rusty.
sergeant lucas.  may i come in?
good good.
can i bring kenny?
what does she say about, "seduce and destroy."
he's christ?
pardon me, doctor, i am hearing many calls of distress.
gonna make ogre-stew!
landon --
you heard.
you can do that?
like those cousteau specials on television? i think it's for the kids, but i love them.
don't jack with me.
you reached down into death. now, isn't that right?
no, i'm not.
where are they?
i needed to think. it was either this or the weather channel.
we're not <u>here</u>. i don't want the desk to hear us ..
....getthat on the tv....there...
int. postal van - day.
nothing.
mr. nasty time.  but take it easy on me, girl.
put what?  goddamn it, tell me.
now, hold on.
who's going to catch him?  you?  and if you do, there'll be another one.  and one after that.
i don't need a geography lesson, luthor.
all right wyatt, maybe you can. but you gotta die to do it. understand?  you gotta die!
okay... would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
focus on the present. you always want to change the past. let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
oh my god --
sorry i just kind of... spaced for a second there.
i think i'll be all right to come with you, sir.
where do you go when your mind drifts?
i'm okay.
it might be best if we didn't talk.
hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
what kind of problem?
what was he doing down here?  a billionaire waiting for the subway?  why not drown him in a bus?  why drown him at all?  why not shoot him?  is the hitman from the lost world of atlantis?  i mean, come on.
thank you.  i only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
he felt sorry for me.  it was so nice to flirt.  he was a darling man.
we don't think this place is safe.
are you?
--some prick from stanford that your parents will approve of. then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
say again?
do you think we could talk about the taping? tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
honestly, it's a little old hat. they don't want that any more.
show her in. then go to bed.
we had to, dave. the guy's a choir boy.
faithfulness he talked of, madam. your enduring faithfulness. now, tell me truly. when you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both.
the strain was evident.
all right, all fucking right, i am coming.  willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, ok.
soon.
and charming?
balance, kelly.  bal-lance!
be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a tv talk- show host.
so you got pinched in the elevator. so what?  would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
we cain't do that, daddy, we might offend our constichency.
mm.
i was hoping you could tell me.
"you have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
well, i always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  how did you know they'd get into the vodka?
it's so good to see you again.
it is tomorrow.
aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
but why the hair?
who knows? right.
you are a true believer.  blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  thou art a subject of the divine.  created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
marietta, settle down now darlin'... i want what's best for her, too - like i said, i'll do what i can to bring her home.
i don't want to see her hurt.
he must be behind that curtain. relax. we're undercover. we need to give off the appearance of calm. you see esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. act as a gentile would.
you?
let's not start on that again, jeff -- please. i'm just beginning to get over it.
oook. oook.
who?
all right -- but listen to me. what happened was there was this party at my parents. i drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
thank you, sire!
he'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
good.  cause we just got some new info and i don't need you getting freaky on me.
okay cash!  logical.  here's everything i have on me, what do you say?  how about a rolex?
no…
well if it isn't vada, the grasshopper girl.
*your* political future! i bought it for you and made you a present. and i can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. you got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  the man is--*miller*.
oh.  yeah.  you.
it's corny, but i could live with it.
what about one guy with two guns?
she'll fuck other people. pretty people. she'll put in her mouth their...
uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  i...i... 
if-if my car is there, i could be the one who... why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
what the fuck did you do with my stuff?
most people are afraid of death.
a la votre.
i doubt very much that the fbi or any other government agency can keep a secret, mr. crawford. truth will out... and then what? will you give johns hopkins a new identity? put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
just one. dostoevsky. the idiot. three zlotys.
so he was mean?
i know, man.
sometimes i do.  like for two months.
i can't say.
it's not -- what's a 422?
you must make the time.  where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
drop it.
) if you could have seen your face when i told you good night! you looked so, so... ah!
i just put jim into black creek...are you acquainted with...
and this is your club.  great club.  i really love it here.  great club.
my brother is discreet.
annabelle showed me the new dress. she's amazing in it.
yeah, paul, are you gonna get home okay?
your clothes are at the city dump by now.  perhaps you can get a map from the department of sanitation.
...i was just talking to that girl in the other room.
is that what you think?
may i just do that, majesty? show you how it begins? just that?
it was alive?
oooh, baby, you were the best. i was beside myself.
why bother?
ok.
....why does he do it...?
alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
that's five, keep going...
damn it, jake. there is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or grace, then i pick grace.  you were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  give me two-hundred.  i'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. she showed me the perfect place. there won't be enough left for an autopsy.  but i need the the money.  i've got to have the money.
but everything that's happening is good! you can be a part of it!
all right. you're walking along—not a nickel in your jeans—free as the wind—nobody bothers you—hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business—shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. they're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. is that right?
they have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
nothing i can't finish later.
behold!
yah, but think this thing through here, wade. ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? you gotta listen to me on this one, wade.
you dream about dead guys?
doesn't what make me...?
it was going too fast.
it's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. it's just so odd and gross.
this charnier guy.  he's in shipping?
yeah, i want mandolins, flowers... they move off down the corridor.
we'll finish it tomorrow... goodnight, bobby.
a couple of weeks back.
you have evidenced great maturity, mary robert.  we shall have a serious discussion.
annette! annette!
yes; from the first night.
not really -
ah, oui! englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
but you don't know where he is.
uh-huh.
he's not.  he's looking for a flaw in us, john.
why?  just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
...and six...
give it yourself.
i couldn't tell you.  you had enough to carry.
it's going to be a long night.  it could take hours before we know something.  you should try to eat.
wish i had a brother like you.
it means i know you think you got a beat on things.  but trust me, you don't.  you don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    and if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. and if you don't, fine.  go with them. cause i'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when i'm starting to count on him.  so forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the love boat.  and i'm not captain fucking stubing.  now i'm sorry.  but this has been one long, bad day.
you think you're kidding.
hey ..
but the important thing is you're successful at it.
throw him out, frank.
huh?
i mean it.  from what i can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
i changed it.  see you later, mr. travis.  that guy has a problem... maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
that's very considerate.
-no cheesy poofs... what the hell is happening?
we had an awful lot of shooting.  you need a doctor in there?
nice to meet you.  gum?
hello.
mpg capital.
pardon?
is there something i can do to help you?
walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  that's not what student government's about.
ok, but remember that they wear it because they have to. i wear it because i want to. that'll make me look different. let's get a drink.
nothing.
that sounds like a curse to me.
i read the article.
well, i'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  you go.
say no more.
it's a change.
yeah. he finally agreed to let us have a room.
that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson. i'd forget it if i were you.
me?
hello?
he was going to take away all my data, equipment --
i'm just trying to determine if mr. zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
i'm not climbing that.
you hate raoul?
no, thank you.
one of your suitors?
nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
where? where is she?
i can't.  but perhaps tonight, over dinner...i've just had an opening.
awright! how bout you, glass, how's that chip shaking?
wyant wheeler represented us.
miggs has been murdered.
i thought we were goin' into town.
my point, well...
peptic ulcer.
right.  fire up all systems.
i went out in my goddamn underwear too.
cuban cigars. you mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
you just go write your little story, roy. i'll handle the police work...
you're not saying it's up to me?
you mean that?
yeah, mack?
when did you first notice this?
leonard, what are you doing?
uh huh .. he's well rehearsed ..
sixty-nine cent.
i just wanted to make sure.
it's my project. what you'd call my life's work.
i don't know what's going on anymore. i thought i was square with that dude. now everybody's switching sides like it's the wwf.
caesar wants me to stay.
how soon?
hey.  c'mon, you can't leave me like this.  some freak'll come by and stab me!
no!
please, miles, please.
no.
sorry, mrs. chambers. i hate bothering you...
estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
yep, it sure is.
will i be able to walk?
we need you here. i can bring her in.
morning!
i believe so.
i had an abortion two weeks ago.
police. they have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
i don't ski.
must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
great.
when?
more than all right. miss bodwin, she teach me stuff..book stuff. she says i might go to oberlin. she's experimenting on me.
it wasn't like that.
easy, tiger.  what's in there?
i can't say goodbye yet! we'll leave it for now. we're not saying goodbye. we're not making any decision. maybe you'll change your mind. maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
i don't remember any arbor day cards from mr. rock 'n' roll detective.
i'm thirsty.
he was a sorry sonofabitch, and i'm sorry i ever married him.
hey!
good, good.  and your sister... catherine -- she's still your best friend?
no, we said goodbye outside the building.  he went off, as usual, toward his house.
now?
yeah.
take me somewhere.
well, what should we do?
we have.
i really don't know what to say. look, i lie to women all the time. that's just my way.  last week morgan brought these girls down from roslindale. i told them i was a cosmonaut. they believed me. but will's not usually like that--
that's funny -- i never knew you to lose that much before --
goddamit, give me my tape, then.
now that's pretty important, dean. you also told the fbi when you met him, he was six foot two.  then you tell the commission he was five foot eight.  how the hell did the man shrink like that, dean?
none of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
where's matt?
it wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
sixty?
elitism?
because, it's for the best.  there are somethings that are better left unexplained.
call him -- i mean it can wait, right?
so it was.  she threw it at me.
yeah. what's your girlfriend's name?
don't worry, i'm not going to hit you.
she bore you many children?
narcissus!  terrified?  you?  the only thing he's scared of is me.
i can smell it.
i don't know.
boy, they totally fell for it!  i'm only acting crazy!
i don't think that's true.  i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny... and i'd like to know what they are.
that was a joke.
she is going to be well?
good. nice to see you, bruce. johnny.
if you'd had the sense to ask for my help, i might've helped you. but you've probably scared chuckie roeder off for good, i have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. now.
it's dug.
i don't know -- i was shocked. why did you do that?
it's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, mr. holland.  the insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  the patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. that nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
that's right. we don't need no fences, we have the gun line. it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. you are now inside the gun line...
you're hurtin', man!
two hundred cops?  was mario sanchez there?  he owes me money.
we don't know that yet.  it's much too early.  there's a lot to be done.
sir?
don't tell me, partner.  i'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
i'm gonna take a walk.  i need some money.
what matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. so 'tie a yellow ribbon' sounds a little flat. so what?  nobody's gonna hear it, jack.  nobody. so why should you care?
that's for you to find out.
i'll explain it tomorrow!
y'see, stu, as i understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
i like the way you look.  it's strange with jon.  he doesn't age.  his face doesn't change. but you, daniel, you look . . .
i told you, he isn't here.
okay, okay...
sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
get used to it, babe.
then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
no, i haven't.
of course he does.  what about you? have you just never had one with kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
tell the choppers we're lifting off!
republican?
no. no one to speak of.
may i say you smell real special.
look, you don’t understand.  i woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
eve. eve harrington.
i wouldn't be caught dead in that.
july?!
we've met.
going over the wall.  coming to bearing 065. everybody stay tight and in sight.
i want you to get legal onto corporate confidentiality agreements. boundaries of their constraint. kentucky state law about. i want you to drop everything.
thank you.
we have the kids this weekend, so...
you have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
and i haven't been with anyone since my divorce. this has been a big deal for me, maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. i really like you, maya. and i'm not jack. i'm just his... his freshman roommate from san diego state.
when i go off?
you idiot.  i lost the key for those cuffs.
royalty do not help people with their luggage.
wait!
he sells guns.
come on, man, i'm telling you what you already know.
where's burke?
everyone you know is lying.
yeah?
give me one more day, sir. the damage control is easy. reading klingon is hard.
what's that?
i didn't do anything --
starck... cooper...
not as bad as it looks.
i'd rather be with you.
vampires, my friend.  vampires.
i'm sorry, i can't.
this play?
what's that got to do with it?
i care for you, too. but you'll be around, don't say that.
you want me to be?
i found it! i found it!
mm-hm.
you're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  what's the matter?  you were hoping to get it on home video?  a keepsake for the grandkids.  thank god i waited, or i never would have gotten it on tape.
you found him.
we're being blamed for these deaths. scully, i want to know what this man died of. don't you?
oh my god jennifer. i should go to confession.
i didn't ask if it would fit. i asked how much it was.
well that's stupid. this is my park just as much as it is theirs. you think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
you- do you love me?
i'm a messenger at the state house. this is from the governor.
you know you can.
okay... they want you out. it's against the law to fire you for having aids, so they make you look like a fuck up. which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
ho, ho...
relax, let technology do the work.
sorry, i can't hear you. some pin head's yelling...  shut up, i'm talking here.  now look, i want you to go back and i don't care what you do. stop that marriage.
damn it, jim, what the hell's the matter? other people have birthdays. why're we treating yours like a funeral?
we get together sometimes.
just pulled the old match gag, see!
yes.
he's heard that it's escalated.
it's for your own protection.
so i was thinking... maybe if i met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in new york good for me, we could fix each other up.
please .. i don't know what you're ...
there went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. i gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
yes, admiral.  sir. i have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  david died most bravely. he saved spock. he saved us all... i thought you should know.
no, thelma.  i'm not gonna make any deals.
yeah. there was this cloud and i video taped it.
you don't even know his name.
yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  no way they could stop it.
how do you know that?
satisfied, wiseass?
well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... and you did that.
i have to get back. i'm having dinner with the danvers.
who are you going to call?
an angle?
john . . .
thorgan, pull us in.
you're home, then.
well, life's not fair. we know that.
switch 'em.  or i'll be dead by morning.  don't want to be dead.
maybe a drink would help you.
what did you do to buzz?
thanks. that makes us square.
you have to ask kit. he says frog, i jump.
not for me.
we were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
can you say that my name is jack?
i don't want to see that.
yes!
no thank you, bill.  i can manage.
not now, i'm busy
hhhuh. so we decoy her. stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
you celebrate, jerome?
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the great mother to protect us... why. are you staring at me like that?
why don't you go home to the old lady --
here i am, my angel.
get him in here.
i just can't figure out how he's getting in when i'm awake...
have i flipped out? ... is any of this real?
go to! what, goodman boy! i say, he shall: go to; make a mutiny among my guests?!
i understand. what's your question?
nah, not yet. look, you're my older brother. i need some advice here. what's the deal with marriage? what can i expect?
you!
9:30's almost 10:30.  where i come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
have some cigars.
i'm wrong here.  i wasn't meant to see this...
of course not.  thanks for telling me.  i haven't seen mr. clarendon.
stay out of it. stay out of it, maverick.
i've lost you.  you're gone.  i can't hear anything.
lookin' at?
sorry - it's a reflex. living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
oh no, i want to hear everything. you made twenty pictures in all --
not at all. morning tom.
and here's a title: an apple for the teacher.
... but it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
i'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
i'm waiting for my daddy.
...who they playin'?
i'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one polaroid, the cu- 5, with film packs and batteries.
really, i haven't a bit of character. none at all.
you take it out. only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
billy, don't eat with your fingers.
forget it, egghead. i'm good as is.
i gotta do this, stephen. i gotta know.
i'm nervous because i have and enormous crush on you.
all of them?
i'm sorry. it's just... i'm under a lot of pressure with this kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and i work all day, i come home, i look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
i was angry.
if and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen mantan.
why do you think i blew up your condo?
shhh. shhhhh.
aw, the fucking thing... i mean, the zoo is closed.
get real.
oh. oh, yeah. no. this is a different one.
i didn't do it! i walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and chutney and enrique ran inside.
look ms. heller, there's something fishy here, and i don't think it's friday's special.
i'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to god as well as a mission to the world.
i'm already in your bed.
ninotchka, you're jealous.
maybe they'll catch up.
he's got some fucked up friends.
naw, until they hear something better they'll assume drexl and blue lou had a falling out. so, once you leave twon, i wouldn't worry about it.
in my bag, in the car.
this is a different world - is what i tell myself.  a different life. and here i am a different wife.
tell me the whole story, walt.
i have to go.
see you soon.
shit. what have i done?  stall them! i'll meet you out back.
i remember first hearing your name when i was studying at oxford. i am chattar lal, prime minister for his highness the maharajah of pankot.
respect, my ass. they respect honesty. you see how they dress when they go out? they want to be noticed. you're just showing them it's working. you gotta get off this respect kick, baby. there ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
two hundred quid, mr. deveroux.
and your sexual tastes were something that you hid from miss lawson?
kind of liked you as a girl.
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write? i knew your name was familiar. i just didn't know why.
60% of the women in this world are named "liz".
he's right.  follow me.
leave me alone!!
yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
what?
you an indian?
am i talkin' raghead?!  i want your car! <u>gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
that's it.
who are you guys?
would you mind moving just a little? you're blocking my view.
i don't have any real destination. i'm just going south.
i'm sorry i'm so late.  bollocksed up at work again, i fear.  millions down the drain.
they used copper pipes in their plumbing... so i melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  it's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
we can't play today?
well --
well, i ... good point. what do you suggest?
i'm not fond of television comedies.
there will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
and belief follows?
hnnrr.  -- like to masturbate.  shit once a day.
so now i need you to hack into her.
that's what i get for dressing in a hurry.
no.  no, it's ok.  i ... it's my father.
very fucking funny. where's what i want?
hell naw, willie. them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
yahoo !!!!!
this is supposed to be years away.
ray, do you remember something in the bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
it's stupid.
you know, finlandia vodka?  yes?
a fed, i shoulda known. who else would have this kind of budget? now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
what he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  i'm being honest. he was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. i just didn't know it until too late.
uh... are you a giraffe?
but what's gotten into you?... we would have known. sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. it would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.

you are targeted for termination.  the t-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. ever.

they found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. what about zavitz?
even so, you're allowed to boast. you look thin by the way, i've mentally undressed you, i can see your ribcage.
say it a little louder.  i don't think bela heard you in his trailer.
no way. i see one of those, i'd puke.
you go back, you won't be alone. you'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  you're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. depressing.

enough to keep sane.
we're being paid to see where they go...how they propagate....
there's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. if someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.

they robbed us! those fuckin' judges -- what the fuck fight were they watching? if i see them on the street, i'll break their heads. decision robinson, my fuckin' ass! those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! how else could this have happened?... what do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
i know. i have acrophobia. what a disease. a fear of heights. and what a moment to find out i had it.
ah, yes, our paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the byronic character. perhaps i ought to cultivate it.

you couldn't have known she was listening the night i dictated that entry into my log. you were proud of her achievements as a vulcan.

no sense in going up there! i been here for hours. he ain't here!
c'mon, baby, i painted them for you. they're beautiful now.
yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? it's your phrase.
like how?
then what is the...?
give me a break. i checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
no -- after you.
oh, yes, what?  you'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
you destroyed his memory! his mind! his identity! and, you want to do the same to me!
he talked to you?
i'll be okay.  just give me a minute.
and how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
we don't have time to argue!
dr. chilton.
well, i want you to leave.
yeah - it's all right... let's go.
hey relax, you think i kidnapped him or something?
hit you? a clever girl like you?  'he turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. now that's clever.  i have to hand it to you.
no.  but he has no love for the empire, that much i know ...
i want to help with the family finances. i want you to buy some stocks. and gold. by 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. then you sell.
well, why didn't you say so? why all the coy disguises?
i don't want raoul to administrate that part.
sometimes i only think about kissing women.
daniel webster? sat here? say--that man was a great orator.
it could be extremely useful to jog his memory. see if he remembers anything new the next day. and i'll have the test results back in a few days.
it's a mistake to think that.
you jerk! you look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. you know what's gonna come out of this... the end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. we could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. don't you see that? are you too stupid to see that?
i'm going to convert mr. science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  this is absurd, david.  we have work to do here, i don't have time to play babysitter to the god squad.
she's upstairs. she wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
i'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. that or die alone.
that's too bad.
sure. you could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
but it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
daddy, why can't i...?
i'm sure it feels very real to you --
wait, wait.  you told her about me?
sure.  i'll fix it right away.
yes. ben called me. he wants me to meet the president.
what happened?
there's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
i suppose we can't prevent that, gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
yes!  you know?
actually, you may have.
it's full a money.
well, it's very easy.  you simply raise more money than you really need.
yes. where are the rwandan police?
true, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  thank you. now, there may be problems once we're inside.
mom, i heard someone downstairs!
what's the other?
i expect so- it's from my wife.
do what you must.
roma, would you, i'd like to get some lunch...
they spurred onto high ground, my lord, full of spirit and looking for the zulu. full of sport they were, my lord.
now who's being sarcastic?
when peter was little, he loved to hide.  in closets, under the sink. he needed a secret place.  but when i'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
that's so good to hear, sweetheart.  it really is. you know, i .. are you alone?
but there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
i don't care about rocks, i care about you.  you bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being best man.
on the nose!  i said place.  place it on syphon.  that horse is going to run second.
you're not going to bet it all....
you got the job?!!
because you have hope that you'll get better?
no way....
they've already been identi- fied.  there's no doubt.
you told me how to do it!
actually only one cell survived..
good night, john.
not bad.  i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me.
you know how old i am.
no.  no.  no!
and we can't purge the chiefs. our invasion talk will look like a bluff. or even that there's been an attempted coup.
take some men and get the antenna going. let's see if we can catch the bbc.
she said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back east.
what do i have to do?
that's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
i don't know.
it's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
who?  hello, butch! where are you?
do you? oh do you, darling?
so i heard.
i can't close these leads, john. no one can.  it's a joke.  john, look, just give me a hot lead. just give me two of the premium leads.  as a "test," alright?  as a "test" and i promise you...
i swear that that woman in my room...
billy had alibis too.
we're not gonna do anything.
you'll find her.
don't know her. take a number.
i been driving rigs a long time, nick. four, five million miles of road. worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day. tell 'em i needed sleep, i needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
i'll see you back at the hotel.
do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  i don't do those.
why?  because she would never show up at something like this.  she's intensely private.
why would they be going there?
i can't move any smaller.
i have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by god, it shall be done!
what was that bang?
through a rental agency.
you're right. i just wasn't sure you knew.
sure.
i'll be back.
i think i'll get johannsen in chemistry on that.  oh! did you bring the first aid kit?
yes. and i'm leery of running lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
what happened?
a pass? how you gonna give me a pass? a witness can put me at the crime scene.
and they didn't believe the symptoms i described...
all of it.
how can i be sure.
i... i'm sorry, meurice. i gotta talk to you... can i come in?
how much oh-two do we have?
i know, i know.
don't worry, janet.  brad'll probably get just what he needs.
and the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. and the third rule...
what's her name?
oh yeah, i can tell you really love it!
perhaps.
who's gonna do that?
sure. and i appreciate that. and i want to help you, agent kujan. i like cops. i would have liked to have been a fed myself but my c.p. was -
now, pete! please don't appeal to my sentimental side.
it's freezing.
relax.
if you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
why is that?
he pissed me off.
yuh?
we appreciate your position--really.
yeah...pain in the neck, you know, i was all set
what of it?

i've struck the mother-lode.  i'm counting... spade work....

taking it seriously.
that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
i was in a bowling-alley.

i don't want to... i swear...
she thinks he's a pig.
you've never seen her run.
but you know who did.
you're not makin' a move on her...?
leave me alone, marion.
is this becoming complicated?
it's nothing personal data. you have to remember these people have rejected technology. and you...
i'm working on it, i've made three calls.  i can't stop thinking about how much i love you.
good day.
nothin' doin'.  i give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
don't try to charm me, charlie bodell.
he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  but he knew right and wrong.  oh, and we kind of messed around...
perhaps this will help.
what?
i'm not telling you what i think! i'm telling you what he thinks!
when you return please extend my regards to mr. maranzano and his family.
we operate.  we find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... i just did this procedure on a senator and he's doing fine.

i found the pentacle.
no. no. it's not like that. i've got a husband, you know.

cappuccino as ordered.
no, it's not --
you know what a hurry we're in.
i went out.

for this.
oh right.  i mean, i am a friend -- i'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  they had him on the cover of 'time'.  you've got to rate to get that!

"you talk about the people as if you owned them. as though they belonged to you. as long as i can remember, you've talked about--"  orson, i am so goddamn tired--
do you have a better idea?
listen.  ginger. i'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  i mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. uh, i mean... people look up to you in this town. i don't know what to think -

that day, had you followed me to the market?
they all kick out.  you run in streaks, pal.  streaks.  i'm... i'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  shelly levene.  anyone. ask them on western.  ask getz at homestead.  go ask jerry graff. you know who i am...i need a shot. i got to get on the fucking board. ask them.  ask them.  ask them who ever picked up a check i was flush. moss, jerry graff, mitch himself...those guys lived on the business i brought in.  they lived on it...and so did murray, john. you were here you'd of benefited from it too.  and now i'm saying this.  do i want charity?  do i want pity?  i want sits.  i want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  give me a lead hotter than that, i'll go in and close it.  give me a chance. that's all i want.  i'm going to get up on that fucking board and all i want is a chance.  it's a streak and i'm going to turn it around.  i need your help.
and if i had known, i would have warned you to expect this. we could have prepared.
some people do it for for employment
so if i get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. you know-'cause they're always laughin'.
i drank like ten tons of sunny delight. anyway, yeah. i'm pregnant. and you're shockingly cavalier.
i'm just gonna go. i figure the worst i can do is starve to death.
there is no us, remember?
that's what we're here to find out.
we did it.
it's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. imbecile.
miss schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the russian sector... you may as well help us. in a few minutes colonel brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. tell me where lime is.
from here on, i dish it out.
a stellar idea, skull.
of course ...
five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... very good. you do keep up with the headlines.
i bet she would if my name was gregory!!
oh, she said that, did she? what else did mommy dearest have to say?
don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  he in the best fuckin' hands in rancho chocomunga, baby!  this my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  ain't that right, nephew?
how did he look?
it's okay.
just what you think i mean.
i'm glad to see you come to your senses. you had me scared there for a minute, thought.  let him in.
you are now eight miles from the airport. turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
thank you, uncle.
fine, i'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! it's the only statement you need to make.
or your fucking wife, jerry.
really??
no, i don't think so.
how's marty been lately, aunt theresa?
do your friend a favor, fenster, keep him quiet .
horses - and sheep...
i keep feeling like i'm forgetting something.
not necessarily.
no.  but he's going to be.  if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, i can say to him, "you and i are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  on that we can build.
you're doing a murder case?
we're not delivering shit. ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
why didn't you tell me?
sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
it was a business decision.
i don't know.
except sex.
for a minute, i thought maybe walter burns was at the back of it. but then i realized he couldn't have been.
no, sir.
tell us.
he isn't. you're not cut out for this. you're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
i thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  when i got here, the bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
i hope they didn't go to any trouble, john.
ah, my dear napoleon, sometimes i feel that i am not really an emperor as you are.
he's on us!!
what? the bahamas? you're kidding.
a hundred and one next month.
well i'm certain doctor spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
max, i'm gonna fight you on this. the mayor and i have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  so --
of course, you're not.  i'm going.
you want to make a kiddies bet?
i'll do it.
why?
it wouldn't be fair to her.
they're all a bunch of phonies.
right.
and it is my pleasure to be here.
yes.
all i can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  fight it. and if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...i think we can beat it.
i promise i won't laugh. who told her?
you and your pep talks.
what?!?!
i'm just making our intentions clear. go check the desk.
nothing for kuzawa?
i just, i just -- i just -- i'm just in a fucking state, i know he's going and it's like i don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- what the fuck do i do with his body? what happens when he dies? that next moment: what? what do i do?  then what?
nah, sounds too "needy."
it's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. it's kinda cool. it's like you're in on some kind of secret. you tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. you have to have someone come before. there is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. it's kinda like judaism...
yes, monsieur.
they don't give two fucks about your health.  the clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  look at o'neill --
it's as simple as that?
porters?
perhaps you can help me with my studies?
meet my father, herbert richard greenleaf 1st.
of course.
thanks, quince.
i fantasized about you.

you're thinking about killing him.  i can't do that.  no way.  i've never killed a man.  never even shot at one...

as i said, it is beyond our comprehension.
if there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?

agnes, did you love your mother?
it puzzles me so badly. i've done terrible things but i can't consider myself a terrible man. i've killed three people and i'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
i hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for users, too.
hi.
then get them out of there.
get the girl back under. keep going.
how long does this... mania last?
i can't talk you into it?
that depends upon your motive. you were in love with mitchell, weren't you?
find them everywhere. 
i knew you'd come through. jesse observes the transaction booth and earl start to leave.
it's nuwanda.
those can be adopted --
there's nothing wrong with me, brother. that woman tried to escape and i did what i had to do.
no problem, buddy. you eat anything today?
are you george sherman?
just checking out the lights.
i don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
am i s'posed to be grateful?
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
great!  bring 'em in!  bunny, i gotta run.
so where's the party?
we had the same rule at sun city, but it was impossible to check.
you needn't bother. i can't drag you further into this. after all, i am still the chief suspect.
and?
what you gonna do with it?  large bore's for shit on small game.
i reckon.
how long?
he's just parking the governor's car.
i didn't say anything to them.
i'm just saying --
i don't mean now. i mean before -- before we met.
that doesn't matter.  as long as we can get our message through to someone there.  jill, where are those handouts?
what would you do, holiness?
bye, bye.
mmmmm.  well, it's complicated. maybe when you're older.  anyhow, what i'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  it don't go no further.  what happened is, you remember that night i was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
bet i could make some money turning ben corbett in.  maybe more for lettin' him loose.  i was up in my cache.  saw the northland man come talk to you.
i couldn't say, which one?
i expected no less, captain.
that's not fair.
am i?
what do you want to do?
it's what i was raised to do.  there aren't many of us left, the watchers.
yes.
17.
we're trying to get there. i hope we can.
would you like to wring my little neck?
it's midnight, harry. my glittering raiments are dissolving.
i'll see if i can, you know, work things out.
no.
so, this could be your last night, huh?
oh.  hi.  i work in your office. i was on the junket to the conference. i'm --
and how do you suggest i do that?
we couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
tony janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
you two meet?
speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
he sits down at the table and says to the waiter... did you get that too?
must be some mess back there.
yes.
don't you want to kill me?
ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... i'm crazy about you, and i thought i'd made an impression on you. you liked the white of my eye.
the easy kind. they're young and rich and well mannered.
yes, i know. did something unexpected crop up?
most interesting.
congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
<u>just</u> where i wanna be all saturd...
of course.  i didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
will...
wow.    i'm bad news.
all right, walter.
well that depends on how you look at it. i can afford it as long as i see it again, if that's what you mean. you got the rest from the fat man and bacon?
no. roy. roy v.
maybe it is! how the fuck would you know?! you don't know a fucking thing! you can't get scared, can you get angry?!
...why am i here...?
what did you do?  to make them take the early 70's away from you.
i must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to moscow and turning right around again.
what are you talking about?
yeah, i hated it.
whoo!
not me.  us.
more and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
you threw it in a trash barrel?
i'm eighteen. it's my decision, i think i'd make a pretty good pilot. i've good great reflexes. you need that for maneuvering, you know.
look, what do you want me to say? i was there. i believed him.
it's okay.
well, stick with it.  i want you at it round the clock.  we got to get help in here...
you're talking very fast.
as in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  but they're solid.
uh-huh.  and when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
a tab.
what do you mean?
we have met ...
yeah, but you did do it.   so let's deal with that.
fancy it?
very well.
i always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
okay.
one went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- i thought you knew this --
you're losing your temper!
you guys are such babies.  you want to go home, go.  me, i'm not going to stop until i find the fucking motherlode.
where is she?
pure idiot.
that's what i want.
help!  help!
little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  well, well! ain't that nice!
what are you talking about?
so if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  with that last one.  would those cleats have lined up?
i got pretty close.
yeah.
no!  i'm working my tail off.  i'm off the sauce, i'm not even smoking anymore.
crack me back of the head like some stinkin' bull.  hell, you ain't no fightin' man, you're just a cop.
picture, mr. saavik.
true.  but why?
you'll have me, after all i've done to you?
i haven't been training a partner -- i've been training a replacement.
thing?
why do you call it "eleanor?"
i'm glad you feel that way, major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and i feel responsible for my whole team, and i want you to know i'm satisfied with them.
lot of pressure at the star.  carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. that may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  how much did the damn bike cost?
i don't know. it might be...
hope i didn't keep you waiting.
not this time, kat.
the secret i carry i cannot share. not even with god.
where is it?
happy hanukkah morty.
no, it was irresponsible!
god bless america.
no. i'm not. why should i ?
gustafson's accountant.
sit down, stop.
but i'm a married man. i got a couple of kids. i can't get mixed up with—
it sounds like a wonderful place to live.
i won't do it.  no way.
i'll ask the questions, helmuth.
... to target at ban kia na.  we probe the site...
you see what i mean, don't you, pop?
i'm going out!
i'm almost done.
no.
don't be bloody silly. you're the first since monday.
where's jill? what have you done to her? where is she?!
it'll get here, soldier.
i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
good morning, mister... it's danielle!
so what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
thanks.  it's actually the only thing i know how to make.  hey, can you grab that strainer?
we'd go to his car.
us.  owes us.
where did you get this material?
how did you ever remember me?
how would he avoid it... as if i needed to ask?
okee-dokee, doggie-daddy.
oh yeah!  put it in your mouth!
they say it's fantastic.  at least that's what i read in a men's magazine.  so who are the two lucky ones?
you think so, eh? which comes first, l or... glooph?
...oh, did that hurt?
where are your glasses? go get them.
it could be. why would a man kill her? for what? it wasn't robbery. it wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. she had no enemies.
call me next week. maybe we can have lunch.
do ya?
hello, hal.
they're putting it on at henley hall. see, open try-outs.
that's all.
like he'd never hire me for real.  not week-to-week.  i don't have the credentials.  he thinks i'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
nothing.  it's not funny.
you got it.
do you know what 'yo no quiero morir' is?
oh, anything you say, paul.
look where?
no, you didn't, frank.
i've filed a report with father frank.
and maybe a little something else?
why not?
this boy's crazy. they wiped the floor with him. they beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  what for? to take another beating?
yes, and on 'dictis'.
today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
demons... this wouldn't have been possible without you... you have given me incentive ellen - i can see clearer now...
i must... consult with my father.
no jeffrey!!
alright. oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... well done.
mookie, late again.  how many times i gotta tell you?
yes.
it's all right.
you're right, let's knock it down.
no... how long did you say?
pearl and john.
why, yes, to you, mr.--mr. --what?
nothing?
he saw the wire.
yeah. lots of provocation lately. they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
i'm intrigued, yeah. you know what might help you, take a look at the cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. hey –-  this your ride, chili?
how did your speech go?
can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
well, i'm happy for you.
why?
hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
you think? maybe i was.  i love this place!
uh huh. well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, i'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. and furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book i wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the pen award which, by the way, i accepted 'under the influence.'
i understand.  a death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
i'll make the soap myself.
captain spenser.  elliott.  i ... what the hell is going on?
we're going to kill him.  do you understand that?  he's going to die just like the others.
hi.
sammy was a con man. a faker.
diner, huh? let me tell you what the problem is. i wake up drugged to find what? you've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. he's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue h&k 9mm. i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. how's that for twisted logic? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i "walked" in? and if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money? then i notice how beefy they both are. hell, even the waitress is cut. all three of them look like they went through the same training program. ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. that's how i knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if i gave him all day. why?
are you still on mediction?
is he a nazi?
i did.
i thought you were a man of god.
yes.
sweet.
and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people? don't think so. you see, it's scarier when there's no motive, sid.
a thousand.
eh?
i'd like to... take you out or something.
watch her. don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
[we don't know! we never see his face! we have to wait in the other room. he was screaming to the girl that...]
you're talking about committing suicide!
you weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
no, not anyone else - just me.
keep your voice down.
carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
i could have grown up happy. a yankee fan. a divorce lawyer.
point of view is everything. to us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
up to here! that's where i've got it - up to here! of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
she's as good as gone...
thirty-thousand, i think. closer to the top.
oh, no you don't. harry, now, not my best haviland.
sorry - didn't copy.
he whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  i know it was him!
well, you should find out. she keeps talking about them...
i'm getting the children out of here. at least until we know what we're dealing with.  john, i want you to come with us.
y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, african-american had to perform in blackface.  you ever heard of bert williams?  he was a great artist.
then i'm out. i don't give a shit about you or this run.
uh, thanks. god i'm so excited! so, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? he whips out the key, she takes it.
you was our first supreme commander, terry. keep out of sight and i'll tell him you're out.
this was my wife's father's place. originally.
[do you know who i am?]
two hours.
oh uh, thank you. no, we don't want to impose.
senta. we have to ask you to stay in rome.
where is he? where have you got him hid?  ah, ha!
no.
no.
yes.
yes... yes.  i think i will...
sweetheart--
first things first, we have to get you healthy. you need prenatal vitamins. incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. find out where you're going to deliver.
that's because we want a chance to observe them.  this is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  what happens here will be a guide to all other operations. the minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, i'll get my report to washington.  you've deployed your forces well.
huh?
wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
we'll try again.
i've been calling and calling.
all? it ain't bad.
that's better.  how do you want us?
he chopped it off
it better be worth it for me.
i saw him.
just people. they gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. this is why the big lobby, ed. but they put their pants on one leg at a time. just like you and me.
you draw lines with pencil!  i know about this!
it's quite unimportant, mr. mitchell. after all, you got what you wanted.
what about roger? he's free.
doctor livingston.

stephanie.
what are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
that's nice. i gotta letter from my husband's cousin in abruzzi. his mother died.
you're at paul owen s.
you felt obliged to.
now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
put it down!
do you remember if you were driving a car?  maybe you went over the bridge.  no guard rail there, it's easy to do.  it's happened before.
that wants to be a yes.
you loved back?
it's hell out there all right. a real shit-eatin' war. i'll say this, though: it's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. the market's flooded. colt automatics are all over. 
hey!  pipe tobacco!  i'm going to need all of this! this is swell!
i don't know.
put your head back.
the plot thickens. it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
god willing.
they don't know.
will you come in, please?
i'm not a comedian.  i have no talent.  i'm a song-and-dance man.
not according to the computer.
may i see your credentials?
what?  why?
maybe that's jus' what he done.
oh, for pete's - a course they do! every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
nonono, thank you!
just a second.
when did he die?
walters was their fall guy.  blow up a building and blame a nut. create fear.  don't you see?  your father wasn't trying to keep walters in prison.  he was looking into getting him out.  he didn't believe the official story.
aunt theresa, you got this big house here. i mean, you got this big house just for you and marty. and i thought maybe tommy's mother could come here and live with you and marty.
he's a regular whiz at it. that's all he did when he was a kid.
saying what, "look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
you really say the cutest things.
okay, vee proceed.  but only if there is no funny stuff.
it's okay. it's not that hot anymore. thanks god.
you will spend that hour getting acquainted with george bailey.
damn straight!  now there's nothing between us and bixby but nothing!
ruins. not rocks. the remains of trondham abbey. built on an intersection of ley lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
ok, ok.  ms. ivy to the rescue.  now where do i find your brittle bride?
i don't care if you've got the good housekeeping seal of approval... i'm not looking for company.
i remember every minute of that party.
topol.
oh, knock it off! _ 89.
nah. once i get my own wheels, i could come up all the time.
oh, some shit.
so why the hell was i hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
cecile, i think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
you missed your <u>plane</u>?  my <u>life</u> is over.  my <u>life</u> is over.  what have you <u>done</u> to me?  what have i done?  fourteen years of public service...
dividend. i figure i owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
that's right. will you see that mr. sheldrake gets it?
yes, quite, but you should know that...
-- you can and you will.
not much.  there's no sign of a break in.  i think she let him in.
man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. all the cats.
he's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
his names horrace. horrace, this is ricky slade.
this is crazy. we don't have time for this.
doctors lose patients sometimes. damn. i'm <u>still</u> in the dark: how'd he know about genesis?
well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. excuse me...
did i forget something?
that's for sure. now, i just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, i can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so i -
cut it out butt-hole!
i've got a gig tonight.
monday, with some of the boys from the office.  mr. rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  we run a picture magazine, you know -
you're crazy, you know that!? you're fucked up!?
you've got a mustache.
please? we have to!
that's right.
i can't be.
i don't think i was.
pour that back.
no. this is he.
he isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *she* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "i'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
don't be so vain. after we found it, we made a few modifications. an extra memory port, a hidden transponder. perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn i've gained access to starfleet's communications protocols. i now know the location of your entire fleet ...  you may go.
it's fine. i can just get you at your office.
i'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  get this door open!
not like <i>this</i> one.
it's a small town.
well, it's a small town. sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
convene?
you will survive this... donald. i promise you that you will survive. you must let me help you.  and when i clap my hands together, you will wake up.
what, though?  it can't be the republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter mcgovern anyway.
i'll pull somebody out of japan.
no.
not afraid of the dark, are you?
what the fuck was that?!
who are you? who are you really?
that's probably why hannibal lecter's so smart.
but what if he dies and has to go to the pet sematary?
welcome to the singles' scene.
in a way -- this girl, thea. you must stay away from her.
come here, you little fool!
he said you lost something.
annie made them.
it would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
probably. but when i do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. i need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
i'm sorry.
no, no.  of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
he doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
i'm not sure dear?  what do you think?
his horns. he files 'em. to "fit in."
death is a very light thing for you.
girls don't love their father? since when?  since i got to be sixteen?
don't try me.
i'm serious, dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
what'd he say? does he understand?
how did you get in here?
we'll explain the whole thing to them. 
oh well, great.  perfect.  oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
frustrating.  form over content. everything's so retro.
no. the owners are in australia.
i don't know, but it's the reason i'm living here and you're just passing through.  now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
yeah, sure -- she's very excited.
you know what i'm talking about. miss daniel.
ooohhhh!
glenn, i know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  put your hands on the wheel.
because it fits my head. you want to try it on?
you don't understand. i've killed, i've hunted, and i've enjoyed it.
i love you.
jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
yes?
bertrand.  clay bertrand?
fire! i hate fire!
it's okay, sean.
all right, wise guy. go ahead. spill it.
yeah, mom?
hey, where's claude? i don't see claude!
no, he didn't.
did you have affairs?
try my best.
and you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! this smells like a set-up to me!  and by the way, ray, i don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film i've shot is in a vault at the lab that only i can access. no one's getting that film!!
what do you want from me, colette?
you talk too fast.
everyone is gone. rhonda is in the bathroom.
would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
drum banging real times.
it's case. remember me?
gimme those dice. i'll blow this board to pieces. here we go...  lebenty leben, count me over eleven, martini...
you're right.
h'm. hessian gold. well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the hessians.
let me guess.  this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  that inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  all our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. we would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. now we can say: there is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the doomsday machine.
you were real close to all of them, to adolf, to hermann, to joseph, to baldur, and now albert,  so, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. what was your party number?
slept like a rock.
i'm afraid she can't do that, ward. it would endanger her.
no.  have you?
why are you...don't stop...why?
no thanks.
...you talk to murray...
ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
he's a suitor!
i think we've all seen "bonanza".
i was twelve.
that don't surprise me. if you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that frank burns is a jerk.
i guess i did.
well i hope the carpet matches the drapes.
can't make enough swords!
alright, it!  we need it!
i'm okay.  look, it's a big house. we needn't disturb each other.  i can shoot a pistol!  i'll sleep in the stables.  i don't care where i sleep.  i don't sleep.
i don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
we did it with the best intentions...
sit.
i didn't ask to be.
i've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article i'm going to write.  but it's not.  it's you.
i fixed it myself.
like a jewel. turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
to code?
good night.
no.
apart from those shotguns.
you're making it out like we're friends here or something. i met him alone twice.
oh yeah, you caught us...
the hard-core four million "nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... they'll say i sold out to the communists.
jerry.  you two will be together forever.
aw, c'mon, live dangerously. take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
i heard.  who the hell let them up there?
i don't think that's necessary.
you do your job...
come on, mom. just 'cause dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that i'm nuts.
somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
i'm thirty-five years old.
i don't believe you --
shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
don't bother
twice. without her sensing anything?
[a beautiful circle.]
now, i never hustled you. even when i thought i was. you know it.
i thought i would need it.
hm--pressure-- to buckley. that's all right. we'll talk later.
you know that was like a quadruple negative?
what?
athos, my friend!
billy, how are you?
mother, i promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. once i get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named gallagher—
get moving.  i'm right behind you.
give me the goddamn page!!
ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- my, god.  they want to fire me.
i cannot take comfort when she has none.
my name is robert.
wipe 'em out?
you need me.
no, paul, they're afraid. they've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
just out for a while.
she was randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
kirk, i must have your thoughts. may i join your mind?
i lied. when i'm drunk i lie.
i'm going to have you fired.
like what?
he ikea'd us.
what do you think?
i have to finish this for class.
can't they make exceptions?  maryanne heinel?  she's such a scud.  can't we have a maryanne clause?
absolutely positive.
that we should take our friendship a little further?
and replaced it later with the new one.  that's your inference?
let's be democratic.
och, you do, fergie.
i don't know. should you?
well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. he can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. and his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
'milk, milk, lemonade.  round the corner fudge is made.  stick your finger in the hole, and out comes a tootsie roll!'
beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
why?
-- what the hell's the matter with you? you always check the other side. i haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? we got a job here.
it's right here.  this region; an-nagaf. i got recon photos.  there're no troops there, no fighting--
wait a second. what am i supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
if i've been there? that's silly! either you've been to a place or you haven't.
fine. can't you see so yourself?
i dunno... because i can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
your job is... the ring.  do you have the ring?!
i'm over here?  what's your name, officer?
you really are pathetic, you know that? mathew grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. he is nothing compared to me.
i see.  well, thank you very much. you've been very, very nice.
it was a beautiful present.
it's curling around me! damn it, stop talking and do something!
sounds like you don't trust me.
we should stop seeing each other.
hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  are you nuts? if anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  the judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [there's been a bad accident--]
yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
good!
i want everybody out of here. we'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
they'll know about it in the morning.
are you nuts?  jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. let me tell you. nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. they do stuff with the wrong people. they don't have things organized. you know who goes to jail? nigger stickup men. that's who. and they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
oh.
"dear sleepless and son..."
yeah.  everything's cool.
what did they find out about the gulf war?  one shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>legos</u>.
you bet your ass you don't. you can't even pay me off.
i'm sleepy.
i'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
oh, no, no, i have to get to her right....
i'm not sure where it is.  not exactly.  i never saw it.  i just heard him talk about it.
i'll tell you what i'm going to do.
your dad?!
as suspected, the probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
unwelcome?  i guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
your cards... lay them down... face up.
your family sent cards.  it was much appreciated.
yeah. tv busted?
no, it's okay, sir. just a mixup with your secretary.
i can't help wondering, jack, why you're being so helpful and all? last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
i don't.
i don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
no, wrong... i sell experiences. sex is only part of it.
can i come in?
nothing.
thank you -- i've worked hard to become so.
jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  he was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. hits never bothered him. it was business. but what he really loved to do was steal.  i mean, he actually enjoyed it.  jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  he was one of the city's biggest hijackers. clothes. razor blades. booze. cigarettes. shrimp and lobsters. shrimp and lobsters were the best. they went fast.
the police won't find your car.
so?
i've never been all that adventurous. i wouldn't be in the way?
horses.
yes.
yeah! somewhere in wales. i don’t really know her. used to turn up in a transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at camden. that’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
the box, joey.  he wants the box.
she could be the most charming woman you ever saw. people loved to be around her.
emergency room only.
it doesn't matter where you sit!
a hearing.
you wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
sure. can we make an ice run before the funeral?
don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. you don't want to get a ticket.
interesting analogy.
i will start with you.
if i see him.
i was just leaning on it! it was an accident!
it looks delicious.
you were unhappy?
i mean, it's jammed.  if we went... um...
but john hasn't got any.
they'll kill me.
it will numb my wits, and i must have them all. if i'm senseless, or if i wail, then longshanks will have broken me.
they obviously weren't designed for racing.
chili palmer showed you my script?
afraid of what?
that may be.  but i don't like the fucker.  i don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  and vice versa.
yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. okay?
double strength!
edgar, think twice.  he works in the kitchen.
huh?
good morning, lucy.
there too...
then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  you can drop a mosler 90 from mount baldy and it won't open.
five years past me clan fought another over some- thing i cannot even re- member.
and meet him there.
how do you shave in there?
i don't know.
i happen to know more about mr. whatever- his-name-is than he thinks i know about him and his operation.
i no from around here.
i did not!  i did not kill anyone.  jesus. claire, listen to me.  i walked in and she was lying there dead.  i swear to you.  on my life!  she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  to destroy us!  if i hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
that's right.
why?
well, one day i'm invited skiing, the next day i'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. you tell me.
we know. but ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
baby laxative? we can't snort baby laxative.
isn't it obvious?
we saw each other a little while ago.
nothing.
where we going -- ?
and i thought you were a bright woman.
there's nothing they can do to me.
i guess not.
well -- i'm sure you think you do, ben, but after a few times in bed with elaine i feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
... what are they all doing there?
what did she have to say?
now, puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. i don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
conan o'brien? whoa! what are you doing here?
wait. i want to listen.
i'm just saying, the man is a problem.  and he's your problem. wasn't me idea to bring him along.
let's see if i can bring it back to life.
only make bets i can't afford to lose.  only way to be 100% committed.
that jelly you were talking to right here?
plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
i know.  i know.  i've seen a lot of kids die, too, in world war ii.
i just got goosebumps.
you don't want to be at crossroads without one. it's a charm that old people teach you how to make. i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  in my travels i misplaced it. i have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
four fulls, one half. that mean we're halfway there? i hope?
so what?  it's a free country.  thanks, lib.
here, you can use this.
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
i had to park two blocks away. is something -
should i?
oh. uh, tape. duct tape. i...need it for... taping something. bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
the secret service?  why?
krieger can get it.  right?
well, i say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, xanax?
and you think she bought it?
let's cut out the small stuff, huh? hundred dollar freeze-out. ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. and then we'll see who quits.
thank you.
listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
no. go back to the woods. this is a sacrifice i need to make. in my world we have something called penance. it's another abstraction, but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. it doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. see, i could never be free again anyway, so i might as well be in jail.
okay by me.
eliminate the competition.
not until the very last second. we must think of something... something to save the situation.
on your six -- coming hard. four hundred. losing airspeed! he's on your six and closing fast! hard left! hard left!
$20.
coach knows what abs are?
yeah, right.  anyway, you didn't know.
he's with his friends.
yeah?

tommy tammisimo sucked big time.
tell me a story, john.
pete, i'm so sorry about what they did to you.  i didn't think you'd come back, i thought you'd want to write again...
i'm not refuting anything.
two years ago...
why don't you cut the cute act, danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
the shylock's the good guy.
i am?
yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man i would have picked.
well, i <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what i mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  it isn't...
you've never been here?  let me order for you.
i called another friend of mine and he's coming over. will you let him in?
knock it off, will you?
guess who?
father, i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends. so thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
what do you want to do?
see me around to my car, marty, and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long.
i wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
i wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so i won't care for you... i wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
you may still. somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise.
see, ya.
shut the fuck up, donny.  this kid is in the ninth grade, dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- arthur digby sellers.
i'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. there's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
but he could still be haunting the house. he's angry that he had to leave.
how do you do it? every night?
you don't know jack shit. i do. this rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got mr. brown and mr. blue killed.
listen to me. the press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. and meantime i'm dealing with the stockholders in new york who are scared shitless -- and i'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. so you have got to trust that i'll do what i can to--
can i, can i not accept gestures and feelings from people?  do i, do i put people off?
you sold it? i thought they stole it.
that's the spirit!
and i bet you say that to all the girls --
she is alive, mr. holland -- that's all.
good.  soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
yeah. hey thanks. that's real nice, travis.
no - i've been abroad for a long time...
russian, french, italian, spanish, greek, german, a little hindu, some serbo croat and a smattering of swahili...standard pre-med background...
you think so? joyce says she's timid.
well we can't call ourselves the mystery people.
that really you, red?
yeah.
i've got the numbers.
why not? what i'm trying to say is that i'm all wrong for you. you want a valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
another minute.
captain, i don't know how much longer i can hold her together!
get out? we had an arrangement.
oh yeah...
sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
plan?... oh, yeah, the plan... yeah...
do they worry you that much, then?
this is colonel richards.
hell no.
don't trouble yourself about it, homer--this ain't your business.
for sugai.  caviar, french cheese, ham... if you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, sugai may feel obligated to see you.
oh, right! the thing with the thing. come on in, i'll get some pants on.
who knows the secrets of the human heart.
thanks, i'll take that.  champagne?
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously.
since you brought that bullshit tape in.
is it true that the reason you expelled philip boutillier...
i forgot to get the coca-cola.
he just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
well, the hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. some will be butterflies. others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
get used to it.  you're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
what about the zoo?
was over to baby suggs.
what?
that's why. because i could have any other woman... you know, when they asked caesar "why england," he said, "because it's not mine."
let them look.
very happily married.
kid, you just got your ass kicked on joseph conrad and now you're gonna go to schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? stop being so goddamn smart.
joseph macdonald. damn right, boy. and don't you forget it.
good.  how are you?
in aid of what?
i can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden i'm on the ground in the woods.
yoda spoke of another.
i ain't sure that you really need to know. it's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
easy? no... we have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
h-how do i get...?
well, that's interesting.  wh-what kind of stuff?
my palace in petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. you took away my czar, my country, my people, everything i had...  but nothing more -- i warn you.
get out of my way.
what? no. use the bathroom on the plane!
yeah.

viridian?
apparently it didn't help. you know about peter, of course.

we've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
huh?
do you think anybody in the fifties ever made love on a bed?
it's done.
satellites?
believe me, it always works. the simpler, the better.
even poor people have t.v.s
just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.

all right.
no, no, see, you, you don't understand.
he didn't know nothing. and nobody. except her, from when they was at that place baby suggs was at.

that's the man. he's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. him and his family owned these islands 'round here. they was leasin' this one to the fed. the whole underneath is dug out. there was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. now this is dickerson's....gasparilla's... private fortress. him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
i think so.
there was this kid that i grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  we did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  things were good and we made the most of it.  during prohibition, we ran molasses up to canada and made a fortune; your father too.  i guess as much as anyone, i loved him and trusted him. later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for g.i.'s on the way to the west coast. that kid's name was moe greene, and the city he invented was las vegas. this was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  when i heard about it i wasn't angry.  i knew moe; i knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  so when he turned up dead, i let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. i never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
your infrared camera?
then get him.
well.
say you were wrong.
[beat] why?
goodbye, donald.
maybe the circuit is busy?
-- ok --
if at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
doing what?
no! just harassment. can't let it stop this.  brother we got momentum!
who the devil are you? what do you want?
walter and i are engaged!
oh, this is andy --
okay, kid, i have a deal for you! if you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'snacky smores.'  they're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you any wish you want.
i'm sure there is, but my young friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
that's quite a change of subject.
i don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am i to think?
i didn't plan this.
there are a few million miles to go yet.
this?
yes, sir.
any news on dunbar?
is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?
leave me alone!
she's flying to new york.  she's been nominated for a silver mike...
what's the dope, sheriff?
before all these people, yes, i will marry you, ronny cammareri!
you can't trust melanie. but you can always trust melanie to be melanie.
i told you. i have to go back into the past. once more. for the last time.
you guys must know something nobody else knows. if those are my plans, it's the first i've heard of it.
well, they can be.
no.  at least not in the legal sense.
an accident, nathan.
shhh, you be the long distance operator.  here.
there isn't gonna be a next time. we're gonna get out of here.
yeah. look bad?
no wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
nope, there's no way.
of course i am.  now come along like a good boy.
i'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
you speak for me, son.
really?
no, it's not like that.
and your folks didn't understand?
well, i made the dean's list.
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  nice guy.  good looking.
no.
...you're money...
maybe i should. but i was never much on killin'. anyway, he moved too quick and i just got him through the shoulder.  looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
me? four years.
i'm not going to hurt you! i promise! please!
what did he say?
you said the usual--
what kind of animal?
yes.  money.  which is what, george?
that's a lot of money for a little girl.
they're coming.
make yourself at home. you done it already.
maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. i could get her a pair of earrings or something.
you have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
now?
i think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. just to be safe.
yes... but, first, can i say something to you, as a friend?
no one. maybe i dreamed it all up.
where are you going?
knox, why are you doing this to me?
<u>i</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  look, i was perfectly happy until i met you -- alright, i was miserable, but i was <u>happily miserable</u>.
i'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
come on, baby-bear, open this door...
you know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about miss kubelik, i thought i'd better get rid of it quick -- so i threw it out the window of the commuter train.
that's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  don't be offended, lad.  a man who's got no ethics is a free man.  i envy you that.  beside, i can hardly blame you.  that grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? eh?
we're doing some serious shit here. now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. do you see the implications? this would be, in a grander situation, as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor.
what the hell's going on?
why?
maybe they lied to you.
not as much as being jailed for theft of government property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
mammoth.
where's pop?
people who will help our cause.
am i too heavy for you?
what?
dorothy vallens?
that's why i can tell you, straight out, you think too much about irena -- blame yourself for her death.  and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy.
i am in a room with lights.
who do you want me to kill?
suicide is a private thing.
and all we've got is a witch doctor!
yes.
oh gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. never better!!
just go around him.
you just became a statistic!
i'm a waitress.
i was on threshold of great things.
how about...?
maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. i know, but --
i'm afraid i am, just a bit.
buff...
it's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what i like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
the last entry read, bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  bruce insists. i made them go out. i made them take me to the movie. to that theater...  it was my fault. i killed them.
how not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  he's ten years old, bernie!  impressionable!
yeah, oh yeah.
sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with texican scalps an' white girl captive...you want to protect us, you just get out of our way...now <u>skedaddle</u>!
not a pressing issue.
i don't think so, sir.  in fact... i think he's a cop.  maybe not lapd, but definitely a badge.
question answered.
oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
no.
comedy. i don't play tragedy.
what the --
it'll come back to him.
who am i thinking of?
well of course. who loves a big fanny on a man?
well, clearly you don't. but i'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
i am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. i just noodle along, i'm not so good. he makes me look like a retard -- he smokes me. i don't mean he smokes me.
i don't know. she's gettin' crazy, like she gets. begged me not to go. got real down. i just think somethin's happened. like she run off with someone. you'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
we'd better go outside. quickly.
nah.  i suppose not.
if you say so.
a fine, for five hundred dollars.
what?
that's why i'm asking her who the father is. it's the most vital question of all. who's the father, dear?
no. not me, boss.
design?
i think i'm going to stay up for a while.
more questions. always the explorer. if you stay long enough, that'll change.
sorry to track you down like this. i'm not a stalker. but i needed to see you.
there are two of them. couldn't make them out. the orange glow of a cigarette.
you don't!
you think i'm creative?
where you been? i saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
do you see the kids?
i have some good news for you, pumpkin.
it was just like she described them in her book. like they were alive. the way that they looked... moved... smelled. they were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  i followed my spear... and i found something...
_krueger_...
do anything you want to me.  i give myself to you.  only put the knife down.  isn't this what you always wanted?  i know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  i could love you.  you could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
i know.
lydia, we're the first trickle! in a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
if i'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can i do this?
go look.
let's go upstairs, okay?
i would like to say goodbye.
move away from me.
you're not going to use that gun, johnny.
i'm not so sure you do.
you wouldn't believe me.
what for?
i'm not doing anything.  look, i don't know what's going on.  but i swear on my life, i"m here at your old desk, on your ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
hah, some guys say i have magic fingers.
on earth.
...yeah, with the baby in the tire. one time i started to cry right in front of pierre...
slam doctor. well, we called him "doctor."
you're dreamin', kid.
no, you don't.... if you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. you know what tefillin is? tsitsis? shotness? you know the kaddish from the kiddush?  eichmann? he went to israel. he studied the torah, the talmud, the mishnah, the whole bit. he hated jews.
if it did get to him.
no. i mean back to your home.
you're movin' to death row. see, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of four fbi agents. and when i turn this into the lab, they're gonna find lafontaine all over it. and we already know...  ...this is your mo.
i'm homesick.
what's happening to you, frank? you're acting like you're on trial here.  this has become personal to you.
you know all about me.
who?  your husband?
now you listen to me, lois lane, let it go. it's dead and buried. daddy took ol' yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
we've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
yeah, let's check out the low-life.
oh?
i didn't have the heart.
at school, she kept mostly to the japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  as if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
it' s fantastic! ----- this place is genius.
no wonder he was angry.
you must be juliet.
from princess helena and other members of your family.
nice place.
i'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...goober?
man, forget you then, stupid.
you can't.
in his inside coat pocket.
really, susan, i don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
who?! fuck, leonard! dodd! dodd beat the shit out of me.
bio-<u>busting</u>.  i <u>loves</u> bio-busting. who do i gotta kill?  family -- right?  obnoxious i bet.  mommie, daddy, piglets.
me?  oh, i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. i see thousands of marching men. i see general lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and i can see the beginning of a new nation, like abraham lincoln said. and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president—  things like that can only happen in a country like america.
i assure you, mr. boone, i meant no --
she didn't really say.
really?  what do you do there?
you ought to know why.
don't get pissed at me, just 'cause i want to be ready when this war starts.
why?
. . . what??
yes, sir.  as much as you can give me.
nothing.  with the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. he's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
signs?
get out.
you may if you can, mr. gittes.
that!... using ludwig van like that! he did no harm to anyone. beethoven just wrote music.
no, i'll hang you.  but i may miss you just a bit.
shit.
well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say jefferson smith.
how do you stay so positive?
you won't do that.
i just never thought of you in that...
colonel harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
what?
i think i've heard of him... a disciple of rothberg, wasn't he?
don't let the bedbugs bite.
we didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
we're going to work on the message.
you know martha never comes to see me. you watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. then she marries that son of a bitch of a frenchman... has an abortion. i knew that one wouldn't work out. not like you marie. you got married to god.
i'm babbling.  good to have someone to talk to for a change... but you need to go.  take her out of here...  ... i don't have long.
for ringo.
thanks. what are you doing?
i'll answer anything.
god, spermy. must you always feed?
don't you really want to know? was jake my daddy? was i fucking my own daddy? don't you want to know that?
oh, i found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
let's just get out of here.
sounds good, talby. let me know if anything important comes up.
that's a big area to cover.
or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
he's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  as important as the mona lisa.
maybe i wasn't responsible for the car accident...
you can't, it's too risky. i'm not much help anyway, remember?
only holds five.
that would be okay.
i wouldn'tve asked --
everyone takes his turn.
you? no.
i thought i saw your car. what are you doing in town?
huh?
you've got a <u>phone</u>?
mr. bartholomew -- are you sure you know who i am?
oh, grow up.
your train?  listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... i've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
no.
uh - now, please don't be angry with me. i'll - i'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. it makes me nervous!
gallagher?
who is he?
do you dance?
you bit someone's nose off?
i don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
you're implying th...
yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  did you bring my bag?
he uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  singular.  not can't move us.
why do you do it?
of course i do.
i told them what you said -- about this man being carson dyle's brother. i asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, mrs. lampert -- they told me carson dyle has no brother.
what are you doing back?!!
well, now you know what it feels like.
i think we're about half way.
how did they know?
you're the waterfront specialist. find out about it.  i've got a murder to investigate.
--doubtful, mrs. leavitt. the main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
i told you i don't know nothin' and i ain't saying nothin'.
as of now, and until you leave, you are sister mary clarence.
i pull over and kick your ass out, man!
krypton? the place where superman comes from?
exactly.  we'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  it would cause the line to buckle. then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
how did you find me?
will you stop? jesus.
judy --
yeah, go home.  get some sleep.  you do sleep, don't you?
yeah.
too bad. the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
what grange?
oh... i'm sorry. was i singing again?
maybe they will.
what am i doing? i'm in here! i'm in jail. i can't stop people from coming to see me.
perhaps. but it does explain how an ex-kgb agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  if you believe what you read in the papers.
you would, huh?
why so edgy, mr. dean?
very well, the job's still yours, i'll go. but if i have to return, you're finished. and i will then do everything i can to destroy your reputation. am i not fair?  told you you'd hate me. 
...sales promotion, "you lose, then we fire your..." no.  it's medieval... it's wrong. "or we're going to fire your ass." it's wrong.
live there?
i don't believe it.
how long were you in?
you don't look alright.
oh great.
right.
the art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. i needed some way to pay the rent. laurant and vincent pay well for information.
it was okay.
you have fed. you were made for this...
the one who said he was dyle's brother -- of course i'm sure -- tex wrote the word 'dyle' before he died. he's the murderer i tell you -- he's the only one left! you've got to do something!
yes.  no, wait -- let's go crazy -- i'll have an orange juice.
what are you wearing? i mean, we should wear suits.
he's at home.  listen, i can't believe he went to the store.  i'm mortified, actually.  i'm really sorry.  he had no right to do that, and i told him so.
whether crabs are in season there now...
he was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, sal.  what's wrong with him?
what about marcus?
they're not gone, they're here.
i threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but i wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
and heavy...
but there's nothing wrong with you.
lucky thing.
the black capsule. finest kind. thank you, dr. mcintyre.
joyce, give the assistant chief inspector a drink, would you?
i don't want to depend on these things, y'know -– sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
she'll move away.
i don't believe it.
yes. the first of its kind. i found this blood sample earlier this evening...
you put up a great fight, lion.
well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. i hear you're moving up in the world. an associate already. not bad. how's margie?
she's in paris.
call me willie.  i ain't got nuthin' but time, mr. garrison.  minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
what we're doing is kicking ass.  for god's sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews.  the war is over.  we've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
speak.
liz left us, red. take the hint.
no, it's kissing again. you don't want to hear it.
i got a few nite owl questions.
i thought you might have.
i've...look.  will someone get this guy off my back.
yeah and you're a slut, so what?
oh
you don't.  <u>think</u> so.
yes, charming.
you're magnificent.
this is my job.
you're lying.
means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
i don't know...
too hot. don't do it. don't come in.
what?  that new mystery girl you've been seeing?
and i suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
i didn't hear anything.
you want us to come with you? i just have to run to the main house and give mr. peterson a check.
meeks.
"...unsure whether or not enemy action..."
not at all. that's alexander hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. those are his exact words, gentlemen. character!  it's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
i just wanted to see how you looked.
it won't help you.  you can't do anything about it.  you can't change anything.
do yourself a favor, norman.  are you listening?  don't tell anyone what you just told me.
oh god!
you knew?
and then i got scared, george, and closed the doors. i . . . i . . . i . . .
will you stop being silly, stewart?
i'm not denying it's a joyous day --
oh -- 
we don't need him.
a man after my own heart.  straight to the point.  what's different about arcade is the way it reacts.  it responds like a human does.  it learns.  it adapts. each time you play, it changes its strategy.
i haven't forgotten.
have a good time, son.
nada.  lemme make the call.
jesus...  look, james, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. however, i think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
can she i.d. them?
- for horrors like yourself?
you'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
he's scottish, col.
my wife?
really?
you just had a good example of it. a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
i want to buy you a hot dog so bad,kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  you're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
it's on the lake right in the middle of seattle.  it rains nine months of the year in seattle.
let's dance together -- belle.
of course. of course. then i'll take the ship without your help.
my patient had to leave early.
go to sleep.
no, it's not... fuck fuck fuck fuck.
just a few more minutes, then we can go.  take her, will you?
jessica? please hold for my reaction.
did you tell sterling?
andrew. you're not gay; you're ten. you shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
oh, jackin' off?
good god. let's go rescue him.
...we’re turning in circles.
i was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! but when i saw you again i couldn't run away, i loved you so! i walked into danger and let you change me again because i loved you and wanted you!  scottie, please! you love me now! love me! keep me safe!
you don't know shit, lebowski.
we can't all be perfect, saavik. you must control your prejudices and remember that as a vulcan as well as a romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. around you are humans, and as a member of the starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. you must learn to tolerance in addition to all else i have taught you. tolerance is logical.
your kids never cry.
now look, orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. the budget projections on this--
yes.
i couldn't kill buzz. i need his help. theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
i weighed my options. but after all this, i'm glad i didn't, you know, get rid of it. i want to have it. for you guys.
the way we figure it, barbara flies to boston twice a week.  two bags per flight.  twenty-five pounds in each bag.
you did this to yourself.  you said "fewer clients."  you put it all on paper.  scully was very upset.  heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  you did this to yourself --
we're looking for buzz fazeli, seen him?
why'd you see him so regular?
i think you're lying.
good.
no, no, no—that's your seat.
i jumped in the river to save you so i could get my wings.
chet, i am calling you from portland... oregon.
i think i should go back.
how do you mean?
no it's not.
he didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  you played the big con since then.
yes?
ext. mountaintop - day.
seems like it.  i guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
i was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
pumpkin?
you guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a heaven - and god, i hope so - i know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause his pains he done left down here. baaaaaaaaa! 
maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
hi.
great-grandmother. the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death - was madeleine's grandmother.
no more chocolate chip cookies.
master kong.
well, i can't let you down now, can i?
right. cool. so, how about we take a bath together?
what?
i have to find out what alan wants... that comes first.
you get used to the darkness.
they decided to no-file. tell me where you are and i'll bring you your money.
a weekend?
mmmm, possibly. yes. but public opinion has a way of changing and you, alex, if i may call you, alex?
i myself have yet to be lassoed.
a scar. on the arm. of the man who planted this in alex corvis's car.
all right!  she's alive.  i believe it.  but we gotta get moving!  now!
hang on, burt.  the bastards are up to something.
the last two messages i got?  the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
no ma'am.
you'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve.  there is no wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
thank you.
passkey?
don't want weak legs.
i'm... i'm not the king...
one thing i've learned as
'praise jesus?' that's fucking pushing it, margaret.
yes! and i will not allow my children to be ruined by smut!!  i am sorry young man, but i have had it up to here! strap them in!
what's the matter with you boys? afraid it might rain? if you want to go, i'll cover this end.
detective eckhart!  i know!  welcome to nightmute!
what?
kaufman's a lying bastard!  if you sign him, i'll ruin you!
yes?
you can call me nell, dr. marrow.
you'll have to clear that through my landlord --
in english, please.
no?
bullshit.  why would mars do that?
oh -- preysing, preysing --
is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
fat little baby, crying for mommy.
look, ma, top of the world!
oh, yes. i heard.
madam ... cut to woman turning, half in flirtatious conversation. it is sam's mother, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of sam's dream girl.
it's not nonsense.
jesus...
got it. over.
i think i came. didn't you feel it?
yeah?
just say no?
looked like two pieces of rope. and your teeth were—
where are you? the connection sounds very good.
good news is that yeah, i found him.  the bad news is...
now, now.
i don't know.  i have to go, i don't have time and i have more drinking to do before i go march --
your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
he never mentioned that.  neither did y...
i don't like masquerading, but as you see i decided to give in to your whim.
how can you be certain?
why not?
yes. we need a very good gardener.
sure! be glad to! uh... a ride where?
yes... oh, yes...
i don't think we'll go to war.  we shouldn't even be here.  this isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  it should be decided regionally.
"mr. lovejoy"? that's the title?
weapons? all this technology and what good has it done?!
on the phone i told him i have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. i could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. walk out and call the sheriff's department.
i did. he's full of shit.
don't move, rudy!
why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
nick, vince, albert and john.
i don't know. what do you feel like doing?
nice house for a shaman's daughter. you must be good.
content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. let him alone; i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement: therefore be patient, take no note of him
i laugh sometimes
i'm impressed. you're a killer.
i'm sorry, i didn't...
i like touching you--poison ivy.  you'd just been kissing that girl when i came in, hadn't you?
havana, cuba...?
damn right!
helllppp!
the kid is amazing.
prescription. for my condition.
first paycheck?
guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. and in detroit no less. well, take care, chief.
never would've guessed.
she was a queen around the casino. she brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
you stay in the car. i'll come and listen.  what you want to tell me, thorpey?
then robert was right about a russian connection.
hello, sam.
they meet on main street.  her horse has just died.  he's coming from the fire.
yeah.
kill me if you want.  hard line me with that 'i ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  but you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  you've got a family.  i'm giving you a chance to see them.  i kept in touch.  she never married. all these years.  maybe she loves you.  i wouldn't know why.
you could give me my gun back.
when can i see her?
if you screw me up for tonight, i'll kill you, i swear to god, i'll kill you.
i'm the only friend you've got, darling, and i don't intend to stop doing what i think is good for us.
my partner is dead!  because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
sid. you must be a very important executive.
are you all right?
signal starfleet that... we have no idea location of enterprise.
morning.
michael!
you hustlin' me?
not even a hunch. just hope.
well, i did. every one of them. mostly i remember the last one. a wow finish. a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
he'll be here.  look, take this for now.
"he" wanted me to warn you.  look at this, all of you!
and look at this, doctor!
roger, i'm starting to get pissed. just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
barrett.  dana barrett.
probably not.
we haven't.
that's my opinion.
uh... nightmare on elm street.
i can't eject.
i have to go to my parents' house out in jersey.  would you like to come?
well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in new york. and they're saying that you don't cooperate.
extremely serious. it starts with a slight fever.
put him in doctor spivey's office!
she was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
sam.
this sort of thing!
inside 4th brigade compound ? that's crazy !
don't think about it. you're exhausted.
you're really pissing me off.
sure, as soon as we eat.
of the nature of mrs. holland's illness.  and, of course, the events which led up to it.
my pleasure.
i don't know.  maybe there's two of them.  maybe he hired some wino to make the calls.
in my home!  in the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
okay, don't stop.
no one. i promise.
you.
jean, it's... it's not so easy...
don't think i know him.
ten percent. of how much?
stepmother.  she's out torturing the movers.
yes. you've made yourself quite clear.
do you know where she's staying in hawaii?
yes.
you're not coming with us?
they had a warrant. they went through everything. they would have found it. i swear.
what?
i know.  it'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. you don't seem like the type.
i told you, i have a feeling...
don't worry if the old lady's there i'll brick it back up.
it's aterm of service, not a career. i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years.
what's that?
no.
is that a trick question? c'mon, i can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
hello.
ninety degrees to the left, i hope. how does she feel about you?
how many times have you asked me that? how many times?
be careful!
i'm sorry, i thought he would give it to you.
i known kip longing than you, man ...
shh.  hide her car in the back!
you didn't. i would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
believe me, i've done everything possible short of asking agnes.
check.
yeah, dickhead.
you're over-excited, mistress cameron.
upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- he could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
i was gonna tell ya.  hey, it's just a job.  i feel like shit about it.
what?
what's wrong with it?
yes, but...
couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
no.
just be cool.
it feels good to let it out, doesn't it? sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
first let's see if stumpy's still out there.
listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
i'm grown up now.  i have to leave some time.
don't apologize, john.
coming.
it's a two-hundred dollar fine!
thanks.
not bad, hot shot, not bad.  then what?
huh... i have no... ... hard evidence...
i can't do it...
don't say that.  i had a marriage of convenience with grace, and look where that's lead...  well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
how do you do it, kahn?  how do you live so full of life for so long?
in that case i can only say good-by.
you let us worry about that.
so.  i receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  no worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
dave, i'm just saying this as your friend.  what you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
that's all right with me. always liked kids.
i'm thinking someone got away with murder.
sorry. old habits.
you don't want to hear that i got cigarettes put out on me when i was a little kid. that this isn't surgery
since i stopped being able to get them on the phone. for a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. where do you go, these days?
damn right.
well, doctor.  you've got your shark.
more than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
yes, are you okay...?!
but so many suns have set since le renard struck the war post. is he not tired?
really?
i understand perfectly, mr. pinkus, and as long as i am mayor --
what??
it has nothing to do with him.
yes.
hold on.
absolutely!  you see this script..?
un-hunh.
you got to be more careful. hands is important.  let me show you something. when i was a kid, now i don't know if you can still see it, but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
and you believed that story.
that's what i heard.
great, mom.
that tom sure is cute.
i have a good crew.
yes.  it is.  it is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
aye. then we'll leave her be.
is that one of your poems?
really?
just a little something of my own.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
sneaking in the back door.
how's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
what chance is there of getting jeff's interview on the air...?
oh, god no, i made him sleep on the couch.
-- yeah, this is --
soon, but first i must bless this house.
do you?  you told me they're survivors...and they are.  but how much longer they survive is up to us.
oh, c'mon, lowell. this is the new york times. i don't know...
what do i think? i think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
why aren't you in nursery?
they're not going to make it!
and be crushed.
you advise us!
oh, i'm fine... just clowning around.
yes, a bracelet's been lost, but i'm still on my vacation.
doctor, i attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  at the moment i am seeing no one.
say fuck.
i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. eve harrington.
my lord.  this list was prepared for you. i don 't think another can understand its true value.
yes.  conviction.  conviction that i'm onto the truth.  you're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  you're going to run again.  and i'm not leaving until you do.
i hope you don't think it's me. i don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  i've got a honeywell at home for that.
well, i think that's perfectly understandable.
it's a letter from her lawyers.
i wish it had never been invented.
why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
pick two or three. now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
okay.
do you work tomorrow?
what is our condition?
you know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, daddy is going to fire you.
you were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
you're comfortable. this is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
not if i kill you first ...
you're one hell of a detective, mrs. christian.
that signal. it's a countdown.
yeah she was a big 'un. you ain't drunk drivin' are you doyle?
now you know.
is he alright?  what happened?
he's the one.  he's been the one all along.  stalking us.
eh...?
stop.
or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
that simple, huh?
i'm here, harry.
i deny your grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
<u>heart attacks happen</u>.
oklahoma city.  jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
and you are...?
michael, take it easy.
what?
we’re both thinking the same thing, right?
take it easy.
you're beginning to sound like mr. kirkeby already.
are you related to the deceased, mr. chance?
crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in.
oh, yeah. 
not you, my husband?
what's in here?
bent.
she just upped the stakes. all her chips are on the table now.  and m’s life is part of the bet.
you allus had good jobs, and that girl in kentucky i taken a shine to her.
and just how do you figure that, bert? what do you figure i owe you?
no, i'm not.  i'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like i'm doing the extra credit problems.  mr. bender doesn't bother to check homework past april.
where?
no, slink --
certainly, of birds.
well, we'll be going up in two years. we'll know then. i'm very hopeful.
thank you, ma'am,
i do know the answer to that. why don't we watch the ball game later? we'll go to mannion's.
you're talking ancient history, doug. nowadays, traveling with rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  look at the statistics.
a carpet cleaning company?
huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
these are worth at least, i don't know --
we were just looking.
what is it? a sapphire?
i hope you solve the case and i know you will, because you're the best.  ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
easy ... easy ... i'm going to throw in my trap now.
busy night for a tuesday. we had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. full moon or something. what can i get you?
hey, pete... how ya doin'?
it's marked.  also there's june twenty third.  and this year -- march twenty first.  those are the ones ...
those two we brought back with us. the girl and the kid.  i don't trust 'em.  i say we terminate 'em while we can.
i can't find him.  i've tried everything.  i thought you might know.
i don't know. this is bad.
you sure you won't come with me?
the room!
crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
there's something i gotta take care of. something i need to tell you about.
this is where you live?
that's what i like about you, lupus. you're a free thinker. don't let the king tell you different.
it was.
that's much better. i could understand that "yes".
could you have ruined yourself somehow?
how dare you tell me to run my affairs!
but does it have to be in a cemetery?
who? the whore? no. she's just a victim. a dime a dozen.
i could have struck off his head just now!
it was released in philadelphia, probably on june 14, 1995.
out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up coke.
that's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
the poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
there's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
this is not a place for fun and games! this is rehabilitation! now get to it!! we at mac have a trial to go to!
we have the fibers.  don't you see? the creature is hungry.  it wants the hormones in these plants.  it would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  we're just a poor substitute.  to make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
sorry.
great fuckin' song.
four times this week i've had him. aren't there any other units out there?  don't answer the radio. they'll give it to someone else.
i always listen to my feelings....
oh, so i'm disposable?
i was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was o.k. by me.  i introduced him to people--even after i knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. it didn't seem to matter--i didn't care--  --until he roped ned in. some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
how...how do you know?
then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  right now!
oh no.  you're not like me.  in fact, i'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
yes. and i'll tell you something else! i've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
look at the bottom of the screen. you see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  click on that... twice.
you will be in good hands here.
oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
no! i felt sorry for the girl, i wanted to help her!
i'll see what i can do.
jesus christ, how can you be so stupid?
yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
we don't have proof of that.
is it...
you got a special friend, jimmy?
what the - how's jean?
hey, yourself.  i see you’ve met my ex.
you know the beef. this new rule of yours, that we work alone. we're taking it up with the super.
television?
no, i guess it's okay.
thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
so tell me.
actually, it all starts tomorrow. it's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from madagascar such.
not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. people like elias get wasted and people like barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! we just don't add up to dry shit.
the man's the same, even if the name isn't.
do you intend to enlist without my permission?
suck my ass.
sure!
no, ma'am, i'm just fine.
i can't believe it. whatever happened was an accident.
oh, yeah?
apollo, i'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
it's my charter. my party.
no, i'm serious.
man or woman?
'dear miss laury'...he spells it with a y instead of an i...e...wouldn't you think he'd know...
i told you.  it was dark, but i'm sure there was someone else in there, under the covers with her.
but what? we took the same lsat, we take the same classes --
turn on navigation lights.
no, i--
can you give me a drink, please?
i gotta take her away, john.  i'm gonna take your mother away.  he can't hurt her if i take her away.
and the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  you may serve the fish.
i wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
what's happening?
kelly!  what are you doing here?
merry christmas, son.
i'm going to be here a few more days. i'll be at the inn. we have some time. let's not say any more now.
it doesn't seem to bother you much, general.
probably an asteroid field ....
ben where do you have to get to?
he was a chemical engineer with a food company.
this is my jurisdiction. i want these men as much as creasy does.
that's why we won't take the train. cookie showed me where there's a farm house. they got a boat there.
it takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
but marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. everything i have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. the business is my entire life.
but he's--
that's a lie.  diana would never talk to you about jessica.  not after what you did to her.
good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
gordon.
i do bite my thumb, sir!
michael, you're sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family.
why deny it? the more you deny, the more they print. let them alone! the thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
great. between you and officer pupcik out there he can be the next jean genet. it's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
excuse me for a second.
we can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
it was a prop for the school play ...
got here as soon as i could.
no, no. i wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. i just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
ah!  the lady is armed.
lower the boats!
i mean, it's a good story.
oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our jupiter missiles in turkey if the soviets'll do the same in cuba.
not really.  look, annie, i love you.  let's leave that out of it.  i don't want to be someone you're settling for.  i don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  i have a life insurance policy, i'm fully invested in growth stocks, i have a paid subscription to home rox office, i have no sexual diseases, i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, i dress nicely, i am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, i don't watch monday night football, the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  if you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
then i'd think there must be a reason.
he stole a tractor.
relax, it's casual.
budington. funny, i can't think of a rhyme for budington yet.
was mrs. dickson there?
i thought it was a nice place.  isn't it?
he got his deer yet?
we ran a trajectory simulation.  if they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
you're talking like a drunk.
honest? your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
then you don't know. you're just imagining it. he's too old.
givvem a cigarette...
am i sure?!  it was right there.  there's the cord.
but i'm going to have to leave 'em here. they're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
what am i going to to do with this guy?  pierce, i was just on the phone with borough command. out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
i'll say.
mickey told me to come back to work.
what happened, kittle?  we used to be friends.  you used to know how the game was played.
i want a martini! on this bar, right now! i've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and i'm not about to --
huh.
no one's keeping him here.
aww, what's the difference. i'm all washed up... when you're dead, ya stay dead... hey, fella!
do you love me?
and up a dime.
right at the back there.  middle shelves.  coupla folders.  nice stuff. i'd do you a good price.
anything happened? i've got to get dressed! i can't meet her like this!
it was destined that i came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
i like those sapphire earrings myself.
how wagnerian ... do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? that would have amused peter.
no thanks, i've still got those. well, i'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn. it'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. remember, bruce, it must be certified.
simplify and damn.
mr. san pedro sula's permit to kill.
do you want to take a quick swim?
managers get ten percent.
what i said.  you just sit quiet and we'll handle sal.
why do the workers look unhappy?
and jus when my baby's out on some texas road with a killer.
guilty until proven innocent?
i know of him.
look at me, dude, do i look like a fan of law enforcement? forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. i woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
when it rains, it pours.  name's snickers.  the plane leaves in 40.
`thanks for doing this, ellen.'
it's just strange.  one day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
you don't want it though.
what'd you do?
this is my first time at the white house. is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
vinkel.
which people?
what?
let me see it ——
do you feel there is more progress to be made?
well, how's your friend?
you've got a dilemma, tiger.  i think i know what's going to help you solve it.
arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started frank. she's strung out now; you won't find her.
let's get naked.
i did? what do i tell a source on the next tough story? hang in with us. you'll be fine... maybe?
talk louder. i can't hear you.
deanna, i'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
triple!
am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.ladies and gentlemen! i am touching the beast!
are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
oh. what happens now?
don't tell me, oprah did a show--
just eat whatever you want. this will give you a chance to meet some people.
no, thank you.
everything is quite all right.
you listen carefully! you ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, i'll fuckin' kill you.  pure and simple. do you hear me? pure and fuckin' simple, i'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
foolish?  tell them how foolish it is, paul -- tell them!
then we've got to get to the lifepods!
i don't think so.
'her'.
i put a frozen dinner in the oven, a manhandler. it'll be ready at a quarter of. i threw a little salad together. it's in the fridge. i also bought some apple juice, red cheek. don't drink it all. oh, and jake, your lawyer called.
taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
now?
the four of you must have so much to say to each other - with mr. sampson leaving...
but you don't know how long i've been looking for someone like you.
yes...that's aunt em.
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
out the door and to the left.
i hope she never knows.
and we can't see a thing. request you direct us to the coordinates.
honestly! you cut me to the core! what's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when i finally succumb -- when at long last, i pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? have you no faith in your own medicine?
well...
why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
. . . and  very naïve!
you startled me.
i want you inside me right now.
i missed...
you're a smart guy. tell me what it says.
yes.
i don't know.
i guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. nice man... farmer i hear.
no you don't.
taking one community college course on the history of nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
sshheeiillaaa!
she's making this up.
i'm doing fine.  theo wants to deal.
stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
i've been better --
i used to have those feelings, too. but that's when i'd think of mom. her strength...and courage.  and i'd pray that maybe i'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  and the bad thoughts would go away.
some people aren't the athletic type.
i see that. washington to philadelphia to here. philly's a nice station. how many agents?
i don't wanna write about no spic.
i don’t know. everyone’s dead...
and i don't just mean the sec. we could have the fbi breathing down our necks.
i must. look-- how pale the window.
no.
i'm linda lee.
he's going to be dropping bombs on mandalay! they're going to be shooting at him!
goodbye.

if they are smart, they take naps.
don't be sorry, neither does dad. wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
right. listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? did he eat some bad snails? slip on the bidet? what?
don't we always take good care of you?
oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, baron.
what a climax to the film - the first white men to set foot on ...  "skull island"  twentieth century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
you're not making any mistake, believe you me.
it was my fault, t.j.  fuck!
i know and i'm honored...
the e-ringers?  full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when congress is already swinging the axe.

cowan--
you have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
uh.  annabelle's video report has been switched again.
yes.
hurry up, hurry up. we open in five minutes.
no ... i mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  it's just i don't dream.  never have.  ... maybe it'd help if i slept sometime ... just kidding ... no, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  i'm jealous.  it's like everybody has another world except me. you know what i mean?
...not the bat?
so what do i do?
will you please just go?
...through the kitchen...
i didn't know what really being alone was.  no one back here does.
sure.
call the palmdale city attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  when you get the warrant, have mikkelson and dreyer search his house.

i know, your wickedness.

not a bad idea.  tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
yep.
a man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  i'll see the captain hanged before i apologize.
watch your language.
talk about dumb luck.  odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. and then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  bets part is she's the first victim.  she knew the doer.  i'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
i thought it had a lot of merit.
no! sit down now.
i aim fer you to have 'em.
how?
megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
you cannot marry wessex!
very well.  carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
but it's not your sword anymore. you gave it to sir te.
shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
someone who's sick of living off scraps. the coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  when the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
that always used to work.
shit, i been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-h club.
too late!  it's man to man now. protecting your mother from me, are you?  protect her!`
well... i think i... i would've remembered.
upset words.
dies y nueve.
i guess.
i don't know what you're talking about.
mr. conway, i don't like this place. i don't like it. it's too mysterious.
a hundred dollars!
wait a second, i thought we were hamburger guys.
yeah man. i'm jealous. you're always great, benny.  "her name is g-i-n-a gina and she lo-oooves me." i did say chicken!
the fuck you been doin' to me?
they know? so what? they have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
there were more then.
nothing.
but isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
then lighten up. she'll never know we touched it. alright, here's the plan. we bus it to chez lex, grab the volvo, bail jam the hell outta st. bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to detroit.
same time, same place.
what did you do with her?
what difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
television?
at present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. if my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
i am the best man for the job.
i sent it to myself in paris.
don't strain yourself.
uh... dill, um, face...
no, it was local jurisdiction.
you're there.
silicon is from sand.
leaving?  for how long?
oh no, the prodigal son's home.  we bring out the store bought.
include me out.  i've had enough of the conversations.
you're your own baby.
well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
i'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. i let 'em practice up out here.
it's your nose, y'see. fans are funny that way. take a dislike to things. they'll pick on a nose...
droppen sie dead!  raus mit dem ofen. los! los!
yeah.
did you have a nice flight?  are they taking good care of you?
you, too.
ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
mm-hm.
yeah. you should show 'em to me.
rice is a bum.
because i think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
it's in the watch. he lead us on that chase while dieter brought the chip into hong kong.
what do i do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
...yeah...
i did find him!
it was freddy.
who knows? it's all lower-brain-stem- activity. the heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. this guy's a fighter. every time the valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
a body.  i mean we're talking major body
my right.
i know how that can be.
the important thing is that we have a winner...
nobody's getting in here.  you can tell them all that!
yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
that's what i'm saying.
borrowed.
my inside pocket.
who?
i'm goin' straight. no more short cuts. theo gets into the car. buzz leans in the open window.
we weren't real thrilled about it either...
not a one.
thank me next time you see me.
he must have left.  didn't like the looks of the place or something.
i dunno...
have they given you what i have given you? did they even try?
jesus fucking christ, diego.  i ain't telling you.  it's just business.  now, shut up.  you're driving me crazy.
i don't need pills... just sleep.
...hi.
aren't you?
it will be okay if i sleep. i need to lie down and sleep.
what's she talking about?
i'll do it.  don't hurt my camera!
no--come on.  should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
sustained.  your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
i always do.
no, that's fine.  what calls came in today?
because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
you don't want to know.  now, wes, leave, please. for me.
but they'd still get the idea, right?
oh, give me a break, stacy. you're much prettier than them.
he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  that his heart couldn't take it.
it's not us, they were scared before we got there.  what do we know?
near alexandria. it isn't in alexandria, it is outside it.
i gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  and we're gonna go, man!
well, isn't this a coincidence.
what did you do? bribe one of the guards?
where are you off to young lady?
come out of there! did you fuck salvy?  answer me. open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  who've you been fuckin'?
relax.  a snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
it doesn't fit.  he doesn't want us to help him stop.
well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... not even for pictures of dolphins...
i think you can. in catcher in the rye holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. he doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
may i ask why?
what is this?
cat, ah!  ayip!
- torque wrench.
earn your money.  ...he's ill, the plane is sick...
okay, i’ll take them...
honey, come on.  the government wants you to be scared.  they want everybody to be scared to speak out.  they count on it.  but there's nothing to be scared of.
that's nice.
no money, eh?
who? jed?
of course you are.
how will you make sure job will be there?
i can get power to this module and sub-bay if i remote these busses.  i've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
no shit?
you've mentioned it about fifty times.
not until trading places in '83. jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies. she didn't show her tits until she went legit.
the skip james record? yeah, that's a masterpiece. there are no other records like that! i actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. it's one of maybe five known copies.
a good deal of it, i reckon. can't understand all of it.
oh no. now for the fire.  strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
i don't know. maybe we should have moved.
why did you kill my mother?
i'll get a coat for her.
i'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! and if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: i'm going to put the hookers in times square to shame with all the guys i go down on now!
i'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
bye, stephanie. bye, siena, caryl.
it's a gig.
you lied to me!
meaning the duck himself, i guess.
yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your dad's?
make it go 'way.
matter of fact, jay, my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine. to expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
no harm will come to the child.  you might even say it's a privilege.  he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo.  and you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  doesn't that sound nice?
it's in the south.  i've still got my rental car.  i can get you there by morning...
please.
week after i'm twenty-one.
i was born near here.  my dad's from here.  he never mentioned it.
stop that, o'rielly!
i know, but that's not the way things happened...
i can't afford to make exceptions. once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
what is happening?  where's mason?
what d'ya think, jerko! you're the award!
our police are afraid of them. please get them out of here.
where's luh?
goodbye.
i was like a different person tonight.
jerry told me he bit your nose.
well... you can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
what're you saying, charlie?
you remember, dr. fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
please tell me, jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  i don't have to tell you i'm afraid.
i remember it real well. cut them folks to pieces. his mama one of 'em.
no... nervous. it would be very rough, carol, if you weren't along.
the problem is, emmett, you killed the wrong mckendrick.
yeah, somewhere?
i'd like to, but i told dr. venkman i'd babysit.  do you want to babysit with me?
sort of.
big bill.
same to you.
reese.  think it through. we can prevent the war. nobody else is gonna do it. if we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  we have to so it ourselves.
i can't do that, ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
it grows on you.
psychiatrist? huh, do i need one?
i don't look at pictures.  i look at the <u>real thing</u>.  i don't feel infected.
uh, yeah.  guess i'm a wee bit nervous.  i'm sorry i could only score clergy passports.
i'm afraid not. you see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. your problem cuts very deep, frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. does that make sense?
you don't understand. you have to leave washington.
if i marry you my mother will die.
no.  come in.
those are my terms.
it's too far.
the gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his state. he has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
you're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
that's a solid name.
the old double u-turn. gets them every time.
it's ok to ask that.
uhh... i'm drawing a blank.
where do we look for little lost puff?
i have no life anymore.  i ruined your life, make me pay for it.
all of these are interviews?
<u>i'm</u> dressed.
a spirit.  perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
true.
for a ride.
naw.  uh-huh.
yes... well, i hope the crew got back safely.
yeah? what did they want?
i am a professional man.
we are happy, mrs. romari, because you have everything —— and i am happy because i have nothing to lose.
he doesn't need the money.  he inherited a fortune.  he kills for kicks.  tv battles between non-predator fish and divers. the diver always wins.
i didn't know.  i just said all i want is some time.
who is he?
i'm working on it.
you insist on calling all the shots.  and by the way: i am not a helpless girl.
whatever you're getting paid, i can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
your what?
what truth?
you the only cat don't come on with that "whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
one of two things will happen.  we're either going to get john doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
what?
why not? this place is dead anyway.
it's marika.  is paula there?
but you know who she was.
there's gardner, hepburn, grable, turner.  lynn bracken is my veronica lake.  i use girls who look like movie stars.  sometimes i employ a plastic surgeon.
how long can you keep lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
yeah, almost...
you're english.
i don't stay where i'm not wanted.
goddammit, tug -- i want to see kristin get married, okay?  but--
take your time. i wish i had.
a companion. a female. like me, so she won't hate me.
ugh ...
hell, starla. i always regretted that.
she told me too, i mean, she told me she told you about sex, i personally new about sex long before i met shelly.
why?
samo.
nothing, captain. if they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
i think you do.
what? no frigging way, man. i'm not touching that thing.
i want you to come with me on monday.
no, i don't want to be rude.
so i noticed.
the english??
sure. that's a good idea. one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
i gotta stay up, max.
we're in.
well, they're not mine.
what if i have a previous engagement?
hey!
what's that?
listen, karl, the truth is i don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. if it was up to me, i'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. i'm just doin' my job.  you follow me?  listen, i know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in millsburg. he used to go to church with me. you're good workin' on small engines and things. if i put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
but you want to.
excuse me?
it isn't <u>right</u>.  i can't...i...i know i si...i, they, i don't know if they told me it was in the con...
because i'm so horny.
garbage man?
well, that's a load off.
that's not true.
what is it?
gosh.  gee, lynne... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. ext. movie theater - day
okay, my man. love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
guenevere. and a beloved friend who will betray you.
you don't know, do you?
we've been set up all along.
okay, okay.  it's not my job, but what the hell.  i'll do you a favor.  he takes the grocery bags from her.
good.
let's try to keep your i.q. a family secret, leonard. before we launch him against superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the metro club gala. and once he proves himself, then . . .
now me, i was born rich. i've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
it's the best collection i've ever seen.
i wouldn't have let you.
i'm calling for your brother johnny. he's getting married and he wants you to come.
that's perfect.
sorry, bleek... going for my ultrasound. gotta note and everything.
the waste.
oh, i'd say about --
don't bet on it!
some guy was drunk and hit him. accident. haven almost killed him.
we've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. we've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  we just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  i'd rethink that.
you did, did you?
didn't have a choice.  my car overheated up the road.
would you knock it off, sam?
it's like that thing with the yellow ribbon...
i think three...
did she mention any contests that she won? i mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
my mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
uh... i'm just out of the shower.
not particularly.  jeez, look where this is set! morons.
i'm talking to a clerk.
i mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
shut up!
no, you don't want to hear that.
yes?
i'm not pretty.
no no, not you.
you're safe.  we've come to get you out of here... just relax.
you mean inner space is endless?
please tell the princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  do i make myself clear?
yeah.  al wants to talk to you!
i was going to, i was going to tell everyone.  i just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  is steven around?
why don't you put me in chains?
i don't know. she got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
how's broussard?
oh, it's all right--it's all right. it seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. joe, i've put everything i have behind you. and so did all of our friends, but i guess we'll survive. we'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. in the meantime, you explain to mr. smith about willet dam. it's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and i'll give him a couple of good ones. i'm taking the next plane home.
you retired, too?
you're putting off the inevitable.
stepmother's...
thank you.
when did she die?
well.  this'll be over soon. venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
i'm not gonna fire you.  i wanted to.  but then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  you embarrassed me, erin.
hi, mrs. boatwright...  i'm sorry 'bout the way i acted the other day, miss boatwright.
has governor yu ever seen the sword?
all right... sorry... i feel indebted to him.
hbo and mtv have also shown some interest.
this is no joke. if some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
judy, i just want you to look nice. and i know what kind of suit would look well on you.
i was standing up there and looking at all the people, and i felt like they didn't know me.  i mean, maybe i shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks i... forget it.
i didn't mean to.  it's just the way i am.
open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
por favor, senorita. would you care to join us?
when the mayflowers find out we have the codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
the phone made me do it!
look, i don't think this is a good idea.
i feel like the world's biggest idiot.
the ribbon manufacturers.
you don't know me, do you?
that feller last night, that's who! he was gonna stay a week, huh? well, he's skipped. took the car with him, too. we wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if i hadn't took that magnesia.  come on, get up, don't lay there. let's do something about it.
i'm too sleepy.
no, but nell's been here longer than i have.
i sincerely hope so.
no listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, i gotta go, i gotta meeting on the japanese joint venture.
shut up.
like what?
thanks.
i'm a documentary filmmaker.
you sure you should be playing, carl?
she was just too young for you.
move over ...
he'll be here.
you were adorable.  the least you could do is use a glass.
yeah, you still got it, betty.  who's mr. jocularity?
i love those springy head puppies!
you said, 'how're you?' i am not a 'ewe,' boy! a ewe is a female sheep, boy! is that what you think i am, boy?
and you can? power it up?
then why do you want to talk about it?
all right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. bye.
...yeah. you're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
hm.  you think we should ask them for their landscaper?
i'm very grateful to you, mrs. kendal. this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. john will be very excited.
benjamin?
i'm sorry, baby.  this thing is just kicking my ass.  i thought we had it with this one...
he didn't used to be cheap. he thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
paul?
why not?
i have a schedule...
i guess you're,right.  well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? theo's should still be open.
all?
well, there's not much time.
now wait a minute, gerry--
no, let me pull over so i can pay full attention.
jesus, jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
yeah, i could get used to this paradise shit.
yes, but...
-- bullshit! you knew what i told you wasn't ready for the papers --
-- i was doin' it! i was up there fucking doin' it. you don't know, man, you don't know what i did!
i don't know.
you'd be breaking the law.
juggle it!  move the darkroom into your house.  you've got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway.  don't lose your confidence.  don't lose your edge.
then they're not separated, are they?
let me get this straight. you want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
tomorrow, i see on the tv weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. you won't need the coat.
you want my advice? far out!
how much am i paying?
what can i be doing for you?
with your skin, i prefer crimson.
i have not, i would <u>not</u>.  for life  life goes on starling.  and, wait, wait, i wish to <u>talk</u> to you... i'm...    one moment.  i was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your dr. lechter.  i was <u>afflicted</u> before. before.  do you see?  in my arrogance. do not  do not curse god when you are humiliated.  listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>god</u>...
kissing?  is that what you think happens?  kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
yes. he traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
well, we were once. you know, that time.
six years ago this may. no one came any more. you "know better than me, mr. di vita, the crisis, television, videos. by now the movie business is only a dream. the city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. next saturday they're tearing it down...a pity!...
what do you mean?
it's the least i can do. what did you say your favorite band was?
like, look at her. she looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. elvis wouldn't fuck her with pat boone's dick.
you don't mean that.
she said you were very beautiful.
what's your name?
look! don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
oh, yes, yes, yes, i did... i wanted to talk to you. i wanted to hook up and talk to you. about what we were talking about in your car.
no, i don't.
i buy companies.
you know, mr. f, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. you had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. you were the king...
no, south georgia.
the maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
then let me help!
i'm not going to hurt you.
home school? what's that?
there aren't any little boys on your floor.
my name's lydia.  and it seems you and i have a lot in common.
just a few minutes ago.
but, sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
no. i take it you don't either?  how long?
just <u>find</u> him.
what's the matter... they never housebroke you?
what, darling?
where you goin?
you sure about this?
sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  they're telling us oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his marine buddies he got maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  here, the third shot's perfect.  don't make sense.  and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times. one "pristine" bullet?  that dog don't hunt.
at six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
i just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
don't be. i'm not. it's good money.  'side, he's worth it.
sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
thirty-four seconds!
used you?
no, no, please! it is not a holy relic.  you know we have met already? in this very room. perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  he was giving the most brilliant little concert here. as he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. my sister antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? jumped straight into her arms and said, will you marry me, yes or no?
yeah, well, why did he hang out here? the cops said it's dangerous -
and don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
what??? you lose your lease on a condo?
nobody's asking you to.
listen neil, i appreciate your interest in me but i'm not like you.  when you say things, people pay attention.  people follow you.  i'm not like that.
when you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
this is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
don't know. my watch went the way of the car.
you took the words right out of my mouth.
thank you....
she thinks you're with simone.
when you have children, i hope you'll understand.
but that's what we're here to find out, right?
did i hurt you?
have you ever tried to develop it?
yes, lovely. we've had a lot of nice weather lately.
fuck me?   fuck you!
no...i just... i'm so fucked up here alan, i don't know...there's so much...so many things --
who we working for?
i think the building's okay. at least for the time being.
fast and loose, man.
you were smoking?
the three hundred grand a guy named leo devoe scammed off an airline. the three hundred grand chili palmer now has in his possession.
what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
that's what it looks like to me.
they're not very imaginative?
should i bring him in.
me, too. i had no idea. it's like i was coming apart at the seams.
it's shorted out or something!
where are we going?
i hear you. i'll stay in touch.
who is annie?
look, he's there, and you're here.
he's comin' this-a-way! the jaw- breaker!
why don't you ask your girlfriend?
hungry.
can be. not easy, but –
i swear.
i hated to wake you up.  how about some breakfast?
i saw him too.  he was silly and obnoxious.
i won't.
i know, buddy-boy, i know.  but those things don't always run on schedule -- like a greyhound bus.
so if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
we're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
