# Multimedia_CS523_Project_2

This repository is created as a deliverable for Project 2 in CS-523 (Spring 2017) offered at University of Illinois at Chicago.

## Project Members:
1. Kruti Sharma
2. Hengbin Li
3. Shreyas Kulkarni

As a part of this project we had an option to implement a recurrent neural network for any of the following options usin tensor flow.

1. Develop an RNN that can generate a story/poem/lyrics/articles in the style of an author or genre of your choice.
2. Develop a chatbot using an RNN that responds in the style of a particular user group or user.
3. Develop an RNN that can generate accurate sequences of cellularautomata (e.g., game of life, or CA with more elaborate rules)

We decided to implement the option 2 of developing a Chat bot using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) in Tensor Flow. 
We searched for multiple repositories which we could modify to develop the chat bot which outputs data in our own style.

## Our repository has the following three folders:
### 1. Translate (Without UI): 
This folder contains code for a chatbot which gives output for English sentences in the style of movie dialog 
corpus. There is no UI for this project which the user can use to chat.
### 2. English to German Translations (With UI) : 
This folder contains code for a chatbot which translates English sentences to 
German sentences.
### 3. English to English Conversations (With UI): 
This folder contains contains code for a chatbot which gives output for English sentences 
in the style of movie dialog corpus. There is a UI which the user can use to chat with the chat bot.

## Creating A Tensor Flow Environment to Run the Projects:
Steps:
We have run the projects on python 3.5 so we recommend to run on python 3.5 enviornment.
